2013 BCSC 876 (CanLII)

- [1] After a short marriage of two and a half years, spent mostly in Nelson,  British Columbia, Mr. Hansen  and Ms. Mantei-Hansen  separated on March 30, 2012. Ms. Mantei-Hansen  returned  to her hometown  of Regina, Saskatchewan. Mr. Hansen remained in Nelson.   The couple has two children, now aged two and a
2. half and four and a half.   This action is concerned with where the children will have their primary residence.
- [2] By the time of trial, a year had not yet passed since separation, so no divorce was sought.   Between separation and trial, the parents have  shared time with the children through  an informal  arrangement.
- [3] This action was commenced under the Divorce Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. 3.  Under the Divorce Act , the claimant seeks orders for joint custody  with primary residence for the children to be with him and generous access to the respondent.
- [4] The counterclaim  pleads both the Divorce Act and the Family Relations Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 128, (' FRA') for the orders sought  in respect of the children.   The orders sought are for joint custody,  with primary residence to the respondent,  with generous access to the claimant.
- [5] Both parties seek an order for joint guardianship.
- [6] The Notice of Family Claim also contains a schedule  relating to property under the FRA .  Property issues have been settled.
- [7] The trial commenced on March 18, 2013 which is the day most of the provisions of the new Family Law Act , S.B.C. 2011, c. 25, ('the new Act ') came into force.  There are restricted transitional  provisions in the new Act. Only  actions respecting property and certain pension disputes continue under  the old FRA under certain conditions (ss. 252 and 253).  It therefore  seems clear that the legislature intended actions such as this one, brought  under  the FRA , to be governed by the new Act .  Custody and access, terms used in the FRA , are now dealt with through allocation of parenting responsibilities, parenting  arrangements,  parenting time, and contact.

- [8] While the new Act was not pleaded, given the time frame when  the pleadings were filed, counsel  indicated that  each party seeks an order under it to reflect their particular proposed parenting  arrangement.
- [9] The terms 'custody'  and 'access' still have meaning under  the Divorce Act . The term 'primary  residence' has meaning in ordinary speech and is useful  for formulating  the terms of inquiry for the court.  In  this case, the parents agree on joint custody  and joint guardianship, and each parent seeks to have the children primarily resident with them,  with generous access to the other parent.

## BACKGROUND

- [10] It  is useful  to set out some background at this stage, leaving the details of each party's position to later consideration.
- [11] Mr. Hansen,  now 36, has been, for most of his working life, a radio broadcaster.  The parties met in the fall of 2007 at a fundraiser at the radio station where Mr. Hansen was working in Regina.  Within a week, Ms. Mantei was pregnant, although  the couple had not planned on a life together.   Both acknowledged in their evidence that  their relationship had some problems from the start, however  they decided to live together and to move to Lloydminster  on the Alberta/Saskatchewan border for Mr. Hansen's  career.  Their first child, a boy, was born on August 11, 2008.  They  married on October 3, 2009, planned  and had a second child, a girl born on July  22, 2010, and moved to Nelson, B.C., again for Mr. Hansen's career, in mid2010.
- [12] Ms. Mantei-Hansen  now uses her maiden name so I will refer to her as Ms. Mantei.  She is 30 years old and is an energetic, motivated and successful salesperson.  She did not have a job when  the couple moved to Nelson, but soon launched  a small local paper devoted to arts and culture  in Nelson.   It  appears that Mr. Hansen's employer at the radio station became concerned  that the paper was infringing on the radio's advertising clients and Mr. Hansen  found himself in a conflict of interest.  He was asked to leave the radio station and did so.

- [13] Mr. Hansen began to work with Ms. Mantei at the paper.  The paper did well in its first year, mainly through  Ms. Mantei's efforts,  but the stresses of starting a new business, working together, and raising a young  family  took its toll.  Mr. Hansen  was in charge of interviews  and articles and would go to local clubs and bars to meet performers.  Ms. Mantei felt he was going out too much,  both to the bars and to the ski hill.  She was too tired after work to go out much  herself,  and they  had little time for an adult social life.  Ms. Mantei also felt Mr. Hansen spent too much  time on the computer when he was home, and testified she would return  home after being out on sales calls to find their daughter girl sitting in her high chair by herself,  which concerned her.
- [14] Ms. Mantei occasionally took their son with her when  she went out on sales calls and they would  have lunch  together.   She would  return  home to make dinner. Ms. Mantei testified that she registered the little boy in Kootenay Kinderschool so he could have social interaction;  she took him there twice a week, and also to art school.  She saved Fridays to spend with the children.   She planned  elaborate parties for the children.   She started to teach her son piano.
- [15] Mr. Hansen agreed that  Ms. Mantei did more child care than  he did when  they were together - he estimated the division at 60-40.  He said as the sales for the paper became more demanding, Ms. Mantei would come home briefly, and leave the children with him while she went out on sales calls.  While he was still working at the radio station doing the morning show, he got up very early and would  come home in the afternoon  to nap with the children.
- [16] Ms. Mantei's sister visited for ten days in December of 2010, shortly  after the move to Nelson.   She testified that she has a good relationship with Mr. Hansen as well.  She described the daily activities she did with her sister that centered around the children.   She said she did not see a lot of parenting from Mr. Hansen  at that time, but noted that she wanted to spend time with the children,  which she did with her sister.  At that time, Mr. Hansen was working and Ms. Mantei had not yet begun to launch  the paper.

- [17] Ms. Mantei's father  testified that he and Ms. Mantei's mother visited them in Nelson in 2011.  He said Ms. Mantei did most of the work and made her children  her first priority.  He said he gets along well with Mr. Hansen,  and has observed him to be 'the fun  parent' with the little boy, but has not seen any interaction  between Mr. Hansen and the little girl.
- [18] Both Mr. Hansen  and Ms. Mantei said their relationship was difficult.   They had several brief separations and Ms. Mantei packed the children  up to leave a few times, but did not actually  follow through.
- [19] On March 30, 2012, the day of an important local music awards show that  the paper had sponsored and that Mr. Hansen  had orchestrated,  the couple had a bad fight which culminated  in physical contact.   After an argument  earlier in the day, Ms. Mantei returned  to the house and found  Mr. Hansen  on the computer,  with the little  girl walking around and the little boy watching TV.  She unplugged  the computer that Mr. Hansen was using to work on the final script for the awards show, telling  him he would have  to talk to her.  Mr. Hansen testified that he was afraid the script would be lost.  He grabbed Ms. Mantei's shoulder  and pushed her against the door asking her what she thought  she was doing.  Ms. Mantei says he banged her head against the door.  She fainted briefly.   Mr. Hansen  called for Mr. Porter, their downstairs tenant  and close friend, to come and get the little boy who had been knocked over as Mr. Hansen left the room, and take him downstairs.   Ms. Mantei  regained consciousness and went downstairs, where she fainted again briefly.   She took the child back upstairs and told him they were moving  to Regina.
- [20] Ms. Mantei and Mr. Hansen  talked and managed to pull  themselves  together and put on the show, which was a huge success.  The next morning,  Ms. Mantei said she felt unwell  and asked Mr. Hansen  to stay home with the children,  rather than  go to the ski hill as he had intended to do.  He stayed home.  The next day Mr. Hansen went skiing, which  made Ms. Mantei angry,  and when he returned home, Ms. Mantei went to the hospital, saying she had a concussion.   Mr.  Hansen

offered to take her, but she refused.  She soon returned.   I was provided with no further  information about this or about any injuries  to Ms. Mantei.

[21] There were pictures in the exhibit book of bruises on Ms. Mantei's neck, but there were also pictures from the night  of the awards show where no bruises were evident.  None of this was the subject of submissions.

[22] The couple both realized they needed time apart and each offered to leave for awhile.  It was agreed that Ms. Mantei would take the children to Regina to visit her parents.  She left the next  day and the parties have not resided together since.  It appears that the parties accept March 30, 2012 as the date of their separation, although  Ms. Mantei did not actually  leave until  April 1, 2012.

[23] Mr. Hansen testified that he assumed Ms. Mantei would be returning  to Nelson after the cooling-off  period, but he learned she had resigned from the Rotary Club before she left and had told people there she would  not be returning.   Several days later, he received a call from the police asking for his version of the physical contact.  A few weeks later the officer called again and told Mr. Hansen  that Ms. Mantei's lawyer  wanted the file.  Mr. Hansen  suggested the officer talk to Mr. Porter, the tenant.   He heard nothing  further.

[24] Ms. Mantei said she did not think the marriage was over and she intended to manage the sales for the paper by phone from Regina for a time.  However, Mr. Hansen,  convinced Ms. Mantei was not going to return  to Nelson in view of the trip to the hospital, the call from the police, and the information  from the Rotary members, began to shut  down the paper after three more issues.  He testified he was unable to publish the paper without  Ms. Mantei.  He closed the bank accounts. There was a dispute, which was never  clarified through  the evidence, as to whether there was money left over or whether  the paper was in debt.  In  any event, Ms. Mantei takes the position that she had nothing  to come back to in Nelson  in the way of employment and no way to make a living there once the paper was shut down.

- [25] After spending some time in Regina, Ms. Mantei took the children  to visit Mr. Hansen's mother at her farm in Alberta.  Mr. Hansen  sent her a message saying he would be taking the children back to Nelson while they  figured out what to do.  He took the children  back to Nelson.   He arranged for Skype communications  daily between Ms. Mantei and the children.
- [26] It  appears that the couple were still in disagreement at this stage as to whether  their marriage was over.  Ms. Mantei testified that she wished to continue but she felt Mr. Hansen  did not.
- [27] Mr. Hansen  said communications  were strained with Ms. Mantei.  They  both had lawyers  by this time and he did not know what her plans might be.

[28] Ms. Mantei and her father  and uncle  came to Nelson on the May long weekend in 2012, intending to take the children  back to Saskatchewan with them. Mr. Hansen,  concerned that this might happen, commenced this action on May 14, 2012, and obtained an ex parte order on May 17, 2012, prohibiting removal of the children from the West Kootenays, reviewable on five days notice.  Upon being presented with the order, Ms. Mantei left Nelson.

[29] Ms. Mantei filed an application to set the order aside but the couple ended up agreeing to share the children alternating  monthly.   Although  a consent order was prepared, it was not entered because the judge to whom it was presented would not endorse the police enforcement  clause that was included in the order.  An amended order was never prepared.  The parties have operated under their informal agreement.  Exchanges have taken place at Mr. Hansen's mother's farm in Alberta, facilitated by Mrs. Hansen.

- [30] The monthly  rotation continued  through  the summer of 2012, but in September, Mr. Hansen decided a routine was best for the children for the fall.   The children remained in Nelson with him, and Ms. Mantei visited for a week in October and for a few days around Halloween.   The  children went to Regina to be with her from December 28, 2012 to February  1, 2013 pursuant  to a consent  order made at

the Judicial Case Conference on November 1, 2012.  They  returned  to Nelson  for February and March, and stayed with Ms. Mantei when  she came to Nelson for the trial of this action from March 17 to March 22, 2013.  The parties have agreed to share the children  on alternate  four week periods while awaiting this decision.

[31] Ms. Mantei has occasionally  requested extra days for particular reasons, and although  the days have eventually  been agreed to, it is her position that she has had to fight for them.

[32] Mr. Hansen began to receive counselling  for what he termed his 'anger management' issues after the separation and attended about twenty  sessions, which he testified have been valuable  to him.

## Life in Nelson

[33] After shutting  down the paper, Mr. Hansen  was recruited by the local brewery to work in sales, marketing and deliveries.  He works a four day week as his boss, who testified, is very  accommodating for family concerns.   Mr. Hansen  is allowed flexibility  to take the children  to appointments  and meet their needs.

[34] While in Nelson,  the children live in the home owned by Mr. Hansen,  which  is located close to schools and the beach and the local park.  In  July  of 2012, Mr. Hansen's mother moved from Alberta to live with him and help care for the children.   Depending on the outcome of this trial, she plans to move to Nelson permanently  and buy a condominium  nearby.

[35] Mrs. Hansen has not taken sides in the dispute between her son and Ms. Mantei.  She testified that her only  concern is helping the children.   Her daughter-in-law,  Ms. Christensen,  who is now divorced from Mr. Hansen's brother, testified that Mrs. Hansen  was a calming presence in her own divorce, did not take sides, and put the children first.  Mrs. Hansen  testified to her observations  of her son's involvement  with all of the children's care and activities.  She also agreed that Ms. Mantei is a good mother.

- [36] The active lifestyle  in Nelson is attractive  to Mr. Hansen.   He disconnected the TV and emphasizes outdoor activities for the children  - camping and boating with friends, meals on the beach, biking, walking with the dogs.  He describes his day as getting up; making lunches;  either he or his mother make breakfast; he takes his son to pre-school three times a week; they  have lunch  together and he gets home between 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m.  He and his mother take turns  making dinners; she does the dishes while he bathes the children;  they watch  a short video and the children go to bed.
- [37] The son goes to pre-school three days a week, and is enrolled  in art classes and gymnastics.   Mr. Hansen  sets aside certain days to devote to his daughter,  and they  will go walking with the dogs, or buy  something.  The little girl requires speech therapy  and Mr. Hansen,  his mother,  and Mr. Porter practice basic communication techniques  with her.  She has just  been assessed by a psychologist  to provide a baseline and is scheduled  for more appointments.
- [38] Mr. Hansen would like to register the boy in the local school and get him into soccer, as well as the art and gym classes he already takes.  He would like to enroll his daughter in art and gym classes.
- [39] Mr. Hansen's friends, the Germaines, both testified to his admirable parenting skills and the activities their families enjoy  together.  They  met Mr. Hansen  and Ms. Mantei when they  moved to Nelson  and have remained very  close friends with Mr. Hansen.   Both also agreed that  Ms. Mantei is a good mother, good-natured  and affectionate with the children.
- [40] The downstairs tenant,  Mr. Porter, testified that the atmosphere in the house prior to the separation was tense.  He considered both Mr. Hansen  and Ms. Mantei to be his friends and could not say who was to blame for their disagreements. Although  he tried to get both Mr. Hansen  and Ms. Mantei to sort things  out for the sake of the children,  he would usually  leave and return  when  things had calmed down.  He said now that the couple have  separated, the house is peaceful.   He often

eats with the family,  as he did prior to the separation as well, and does the clean-up. He is close to the children  and hopes to continue  to be involved  in their lives.

- [41] Mr. Hansen's proposal for allocation of parenting  time is as follows:

The children will reside in Nelson with Mr. Hansen.

Ms. Mantei will have  reasonable and generous access/parenting  time with the children,  including,  but not limited to, the first three weeks of July  and the last three weeks of August of each summer, or such other six week block as agreed upon;

Starting in December of 2013, the children will be with Ms. Mantei from the day after school is dismissed for the Christmas holiday until  the day before school goes back, and in 2014, from Boxing Day until the day before school goes back, and alternating  each year thereafter.

The children will spend the entire two week Spring Break with Ms. Mantei each year.

Once a month,  with the exception of the month  in which  the majority  of the Spring Break occurs, and July,  August and December, Ms. Mantei may spend one week with the children  under her care in Nelson.

The parties will meet halfway  at Christmas, Spring Break and summer to share cost and time of transport.

Ms. Mantei will have  generous and private telephone,  Skype, and computer access with the children.

## Life in Regina

- [42] While in Regina, the children live with Ms. Mantei.  She stayed with her parents for a time after the end of the marriage, then house-sat,  and now rents a house that she hopes to buy.   She has painted and decorated bedrooms for the children.
- [43] Ms. Mantei testified that she tries to keep the children's schedules the same when they are with her in Regina as they  are when  they are with their father  in Nelson - they  do the same activities and have play dates.  They  have the same blankets and toys.  She enrolled the little boy in gymnastics and swimming.   She prepared a calendar for her son to count  down the days until he would be in Regina again, but Mr. Hansen  discouraged this once the children returned  to Nelson.

- [44] Ms. Mantei obtained a job with Coca Cola that was not to her liking, and is now employed with Grand &amp; Toy in a challenging  and remunerative  job that she intends to maintain.  She also plans to complete her degree, and she does some additional work for native bands.  She has always modelled part-time and would continue  to do so, but she emphasized that  any extra demands on her time would take second place to her children.   She says her work is flexible,  and much  of it can be done from home.
- [45] There are schools nearby her rental  home and the children  have friends in Regina.  Her extended  family is close by.  Her sister and father testified to Ms. Mantei's parenting abilities and their close bonds with the children.   Her sister often took care of the children while they  were with Ms. Mantei in Regina, although her sister has now moved to Saskatoon to go to school.
- [46] Ms. Mantei's proposal is as follows:

The children will reside in Regina with Ms. Mantei.

The children will spend May 19-24 with Mr. Hansen,  with one day travel  time on each side.

The children will spend all of July  to August 18 with Mr. Hansen

The children will spend the weeks of October 13-18 and November  10 - 17 with Mr. Hansen,  with one day travel time on either side of each visit.

The children will spend December 22 to January  3 with Mr. Hansen, with one day travel  time on each side.

The children will spend the week of February  16 - 23 and March 16 23 with Mr. Hansen,  with one day travel  time on each side of each visit.

- [47] Ms. Mantei calculates these days as 267 with her; 114 with Mr. Hansen,  and 15 travel  days, which she says is a more generous schedule than  that proposed by Mr. Hansen.

## Miscellaneous issues

- [48] Neither parent is involved  in a new relationship at this time, although Ms. Mantei is close friends with a former friend of the family from the Lloydminster

days and went  to Jamaica with him for a holiday last Christmas.  Both she and the friend testified that he is a support, but not a romantic interest.  This has caused Mr. Hansen some unhappiness, but his reaction has been confined to a phone call to the friend to tell him of his disappointment.  The friend testified that when  he and his ex-wife were friends with the Hansens  in Lloydminster,  he and Mr. Hansen  did not involve  themselves  with child care during their social gatherings.

- [49] One of the exhibits in the claimant's book of documents,  entered by consent, is a draft memoir of Ms. Mantei's.  Mr. Hansen  said the preparation and editing of this memoir took up a great deal of Ms. Mantei's time during the marriage. Ms. Mantei admitted in cross-examination  that it contains a fairly detailed account  of her first sexual experiences as a teenager with a boyfriend whom she contacted when she returned  to Regina during the marriage, against Ms. Hansen's wishes. The boyfriend is a tattoo artist and Ms. Mantei wanted him to remove a dolphin tattoo and replace it with a quill.  Counsel for Ms. Mantei asked that the memoir, which is almost 200 pages, not be considered.  Counsel for the claimant said it is properly

before the court.

- [50] The memoir was indeed entered as an exhibit by consent, and was referred to, so it is part of the record.  However,  I indicated to counsel  that since Ms. Mantei admitted the portions Mr. King referred her to I did not intend to read the almost 200 pages and have not done so.  There was no suggestion that  the contents  of the memoir would reflect on the consideration of what  is in the best interests of the children.

## STATUTORY STRUCTURE

- [51] Before going into the details of each party's position, I will set out the sections of the Divorce Act and the new Act that are potentially  applicable to the circumstances  here.  I say 'potentially'  because, although  the parents now live in different provinces,  this is not a traditional 'mobility' case - no one seeks permission to move with the children,  and there is presently  no order in place.  However some of

the factors that govern  those applications (now called 'relocation' under the new Act ) could be relevant  to these circumstances.

- [52] There appears to have been no attempt by the legislature to harmonize  the new Act with the Divorce Act .  Under the FRA, orders for custody and access were made in the same terms as under  the Divorce Act , although  the statutory considerations were slightly  different.   Guardianship  was an order made only  under the FRA .  Under the new Act , the term 'guardian' is continued,  but the meaning has changed to include the concept of custody as well.  Thus  the framing of orders dealing with parental roles after separation is now completely  different between the federal and provincial  Acts.
- [53] Under the Divorce Act , s. 16 governs custody  orders and s. 17 governs variation of such orders.  The relevant  subsections of s. 16 provide:
- (1) A court of competent jurisdiction may, on application by either or both spouses or by any other person, make an order respecting the custody of or the access to, or the custody of and access to, any or all children of the marriage.

...

- (5) Unless the court orders otherwise, a spouse who is granted access to a child of the marriage has the right to make inquiries, and to be given information, as to the health, education and welfare of the child.

...

- (8) In making an order under this section, the courts shall take into consideration only the best interests of the child of the marriage as determined by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the child.
- (9) In making an order under this section, the court shall not take into consideration the past conduct of any person unless the conduct is relevant to the ability of that person to act as a parent of a child.
- (10) In making an order under this section, the court shall give effect to the principle that a child of the marriage should have as much contact with each spouse as is consistent with the best interests of the child and, for that purpose, shall take into consideration the willingness of the person for whom custody is sought to facilitate such contact.

- [54] Section 17(5) requires the consideration of only  the best interests of the child in making a variation order, which  must be based on a change in the condition, means, needs or other circumstances of the child.
- [55] The seminal case on changes in residence under the Divorce Act is Gordon v. Goertz ,  [1996] 2 S.C.R. 27.  In  that case, there was an existing order granting custody  to the mother.   The court required a material change in circumstances  for that order to be revisited.  The mother planned  to move to Australia with the children. In  the circumstances  here, there is no existing order and the children have been shared to a great extent.   However,  the comments in that case are of some relevance  because they show that the best interests of the children,  not of the parents, are the primary concern.   Even where  there is a custody order, there is no presumption in favour  of the custodial parent.
- [56] In Nunweiler v. Nunweiler ,  2000 BCCA 300, the Court of Appeal considered Gordon v. Goertz in the context  of an initial determination of custody:
- [28]  ...First, the decision directs the court to consider the motive for a parent's relocation only in the context of assessing the parent's ability to meet the needs of the child.  This, in my view, is as relevant a direction on an initial custody hearing as on a variation hearing.  Second, the decision confirms the significance of the instruction, found in s. 16)(10), to consider the willingness of the parent to facilitate contact, but notes that this consideration is subordinate to the over-all consideration of the best interests of the child. Third, and more broadly, it approaches the issues of a relocation from a perspective of respect for a parent's decision to live and work where he or she chooses, barring an improper motive.
- [57] The parents in this case want  joint custody  and neither has primary residence at present.  Ms. Mantei has already moved to Regina.  While the passage just quoted is therefore  not directly applicable to the circumstances here, it emphasizes the need to consider the best interests of the children  within the context  of the relocation of one of the parents.
- [58] Under ss. 24, 27 and 35 of the FRA , parents who were still living together were presumed to be joint guardians of a child unless a court otherwise ordered, and a court could order that one or more persons exercise custody  over a child or have

access to the child.  The court was required to give paramount  consideration to the health  and emotional well being of the child, including special needs for care and treatment;  the views of the child, if appropriate; the love, affection and similar ties that exist between the child and other person; education and training for the child, and the capacity of each person to exercise the rights and duties of guardianship, custody  or access adequately,  and the material well-being of the child.  Conduct was not an issue unless it affected one of these factors.

- [59] Under the new Act , the terms 'custody'  and 'access' are no longer used. Part 4 of the new Ac t is entitled: 'Care of and time with children'.   Under s. 39, each parent, while together,  and after separation, is a guardian of the child, unless otherwise agreed or ordered.  Under s. 40(1), only  a guardian may have parental responsibilities and parenting time with respect to a child.  Under s. 40(2), unless otherwise ordered or agreed, each child's guardian may exercise all parental responsibilities with respect to the child in consultation  with the child's other guardians, unless  consultation  would be unreasonable  or inappropriate in the circumstances.   Section 40(3) provides for the allocation of parental responsibilities between guardians by agreement or order.

[60] Section 40(4) provides that in 'making' the arrangements,  which presumably means by agreement or order, there are no presumptions  that any particular arrangement  is in the best interests of the child, including equal allocation or sharing of responsibilities or decision making.

[61] The legislature has decided to provide a list of factors that  are stated to be in the best interests of the child, and a list of what are said to be parenting responsibilities.  Although  the terms are now different,  there appears to be little new in these concepts.  Most if not all of these considerations can be gleaned from a brief perusal of case law under  the FRA and/or the Divorce Act , and have always  been concerns that  courts have taken into account  in discharging their responsibilities to the children whose best interests they  have endeavoured  to protect and enhance.   In any event,  we now have lists.

## [62] Section 37 provides:

## Best interests of the child

- (1) In making an agreement or order under this Part respecting guardianship, parenting arrangements or contact with a child, the parties and the court must consider the best interests of the child only.
- (2) To determine what is in the best interests of a child, all of the child's needs and circumstances must be considered, including the following:
3. (a) the child's health and emotional well-being;
4. (b) the child's views, unless it would be inappropriate to consider them;
5. (c) the nature and strength of the relationships between the child and significant persons in the child's life;
6. (d) the history of the child's care;
7. (e) the child's need for stability, given the child's age and stage of development;
8. (f) the ability  of each person who is a guardian or seeks guardianship of the child, or who has or seeks parental responsibilities, parenting time or contact with the child, to exercise his or her responsibilities;
9. (g) the impact of any family violence on the child's safety, security or well-being, whether the family violence is directed toward the child or another family member;
10. (h) whether the actions of a person responsible for family violence indicate that the person may be impaired in his or her ability to care for the child and meet the child's needs;
11. (i) the appropriateness of an arrangement that would require the child's guardians to cooperate on issues affecting the child, including whether requiring cooperation would increase any risks to the safety, security, or well-being of the child or other family members;
12. (j) any civil or criminal proceeding relevant to the child's safety, security or well-being.
- (3) An agreement or order is not in the best interests of a child unless it protects, to the greatest extent possible, the child's physical, psychological and emotional safety, security and well-being.
- (4) In making an order under this Part, a court may consider a person's conduct only if it substantially affects a factor set out in subsection (2), and only to the extent that it affects that factor.

[63] 'Parental responsibilities' is defined in s. 1 of the new Act to mean one or more of the responsibilities listed in s. 41, which provides:

41.  For the purposes of this Part, parental responsibilities with respect to a child are as follows:

- (a) making day-to-day decisions affecting the child and having day-to-day care, control and supervision of the child;
- (b) making decisions respecting where the child will reside;
- (c) making decisions respecting with whom the child will live and associate;
- (d) making decisions respecting the child's education and participation in extracurricular activities, including the nature, extent and location;
- (e) making decisions respecting the child's cultural, linguistic, religious and spiritual upbringing and heritage, including, if the child is an aboriginal child, the child's aboriginal identity;
- (f) subject to section 17 of the Infants Act, giving, refusing or withdrawing consent to medical, dental and other health-related treatments for the child;
- (g) applying for a passport, licence, permit, benefit, privilege or other thing for the child;
- (h) giving, refusing or withdrawing consent for the child, if consent is required;
- (i) receiving and responding to any notice that a parent or guardian is entitled or required by law to receive;
- (j) requesting and receiving from third parties health, education or other information respecting the child;
- (k) subject to any applicable provincial legislation,
- (i) starting, defending, compromising or settling any proceeding relating to the child, and
- (ii) identifying, advancing and protecting the child's legal and financial interests;
- (l) exercising any other responsibilities reasonably necessary to nurture the child's development.

[64] 'Parenting  arrangements'  is defined in s. 1 to be arrangements  respecting the allocation of parental responsibilities or parenting time, or both.  'Parenting  time' is defined as described in s. 42:  'time that a child is with a guardian,  as allocated under an agreement or order'.

## [65] Section 42(2) provides that:

during parenting time, a guardian may exercise, subject to an agreement or order that provides otherwise, the parental responsibility of making day-to-

day decisions affecting the child and having day-to-day care, control and supervision of the child.

- [66] Section 45 deals with applications and orders:
45.  (1) On application by a guardian, a court may make an order respecting one or more of the following:
3. (a) the allocation of parental responsibilities;
4. (b) parenting time;
5. (c) the implementation of an order made under this Division
6. (d) the means for resolving disputes respecting an order made under this Division.
- [67] Section 45(2) clarifies that orders can only  be made for parents who are separated, (3) deals with supervised transfers  and visits, and (4) allows an application respecting parenting arrangements  to be made at the same time as an application respecting guardianship.
- [68] Section 46 deals with changes to the child's residence in the absence of an order or agreement.   Section 47 deals with a change to an order, based on a change in the needs or circumstances  of the child, including  a change in the circumstances of another person.
- [69] Section 64 allows the court to make an order that a person not remove a child from a specified geographical area.
- [70] Section 65 deals with relocations, defined to be 'a change in the location of the residence of a child or child's guardian that can reasonably be expected to have a significant impact on the child's relationship'  with the other guardian or other significant persons.
- [71] Section 69(5) deals with relocations where guardians have substantially  equal parenting time with the children.   This case does not fall neatly  into this category because Ms. Mantei has already moved to Regina.  However,  the parents have endeavoured to ensure each has large blocks of time with the children,  so it is useful to set out the factors in s. 69(5) in any event  because, regardless of who has the

majority of the parenting time with the children,  the result  of this action will be the separation of the parents between Nelson,  B.C. and Regina, Saskatchewan.

- [72] The relocating guardian must satisfy the court that:
2. (i) the proposed relocation is made in good faith, and
3. (ii) the relocating guardian has proposed reasonable and workable arrangements to preserve the relationship  between the children and the children's other guardians, persons who are entitled to contact with the child, and other person who have a significant role in the children's life, and
4. (iii) that the relocation is in the best interests of the children.
- [73] Section 70(2) provides that, when  making a relocation order, a court must seek to preserve, to a reasonable extent,  parenting  arrangements  under the  original agreement or order.  Here, as mentioned above, there is no entered order; the parties have  operated on the basis of the unentered  order and their informal  interim agreement referred to above.

## POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES

- [74] The parties agree that there should be an order for joint  custody and joint guardianship.   An order for joint custody is available under the Divorce Act .  Both parents are guardians under the new Act , but the meaning of 'guardian' has changed and will be discussed below.
- [75] Each parent contends that the best interests of these two young  children  lie in residing with him or her.  Neither suggests that the two children  be separated.  Each acknowledges the other to be a good parent.  Each parent has extended  family to whom the children are bonded.  Each accepts that the other will facilitate generous contact with the children,  although  there is a difference of opinion between them as to the practical effect of the respective calendars of proposed contact.
- [76] Both parents are gainfully  employed.  Ms. Mantei's job is new, but she is likely to make approximately  twice what  Mr. Hansen  does.  Each parent has a home that is suitable for the children.   Ms. Mantei is renting  at present, but plans to buy.

[77] The parents disagree on the extent  of Mr. Hansen's involvement  in child care prior to the separation.  Ms. Mantei says she was always  the primary care-giver; Mr. Hansen was a fun  parent, but was busy with his own activities.  Mr. Hansen  says Ms. Mantei was too busy  in Nelson  to take care of the children,  and after he would return  from his early morning shift at the radio station, he would nap with the children and do the majority  of the child care.

[78] Ms. Mantei acknowledged that  since separation, Mr. Hansen is 'ten-fold  the father he was' during the marriage.

[79] Mr. Hansen says the following  factors support his position that the best interests of the children  are met by having them  stay primarily with him in Nelson: his program is the most stable and the least risky, leading to their optimal development;  he has a genuine  willingness  and motivation to embrace the communication and input necessary  for co-parenting;  he has no animus towards Ms. Mantei, whereas he feels she bears him some resentment;  the family agreed, as a unit,  that Nelson was the best place to raise the children;  he is closely  bonded with the children.   Mr. Hansen says he has made the children  his first priority since separation.  He wound  down the paper, as he could not run it without  Ms. Mantei, and accepted a job that gives him flexibility.   He has kept the family home with all the familiar surroundings  for the children.   He now goes out only once a week.  He and the children have warm and loving support from his mother,  close friends, and the community.   He has taken control  of the problems associated with the youngest child's development  and has sent her for assessments and set up appointments with a paediatrician.  His work allows him the flexibility  to attend appointments with the children.

[80] On the other hand,  Mr. Hansen  submits, Ms. Mantei has taken a job in Regina that means the children  will have  to leave the stability of their home in Nelson.   Her job will entail considerable pressure as she builds up the sales in her area.  She has many commitments and will have difficulty  making the children  her first priority.

[81] Ms. Mantei says the necessary presence of Mr. Hansen's mother shows that he is in no better position than  she is to provide full-time  care for the children.   He could not raise them alone, and neither can she.  She will require day care; he has his mother to assist.

[82] Ms. Mantei emphasizes the primary role she had in the care of the children prior to the separation.  She says she has provided the greater portion of child care historically,  and her focus has been on the children,  not on a social life.  She has good financial prospects and will facilitate all the factors that go towards the best interests of the children.   Her home is situated close to schools; she has an extended family  that is closely bonded to the children.   While she is developing her career, she will put the children first, as she has always done.

[83] Ms. Mantei says Mr. Hansen has never  stayed in one place very  long. Although  Mr. Hansen  has eventually  agreed to extra time for her,  she has had to fight for it from a disadvantaged position because Mr. Hansen obtained the 'no removal'  order.  She says she has made more efforts to communicate  since separation than  Mr. Hansen  has and has taken the travel burden  on herself to ensure maximum time with the children.

[84] In  reply, Mr. Hansen  says he had to move regularly  in his earlier radio career or there was no prospect for advancement.   Upon moving to Nelson, he knew this was where he wanted to stay and raise the children.   He says he obtained the 'no removal'  order to restore some certainty  to the situation.   Ms. Mantei could have applied to set aside the 'no removal' order, but instead the parties worked out an arrangement  to share the children.

## DISCUSSION

[85] The children are young  and care of them has been shared since separation a little  over a year ago.  The family  had decided to raise the children in Nelson,  and there is an existing order preventing  their removal  from the West Kootenays without agreement.  That is an interlocutory  order, subject  to being set aside, and should  not in itself form the foundation  for a particular status quo.  Fortunately,  the parties have

been able to agree on exchanging  the children  for long periods of time, although  for the most part, the children remained in Nelson  for the fall of 2012.  They  have spent all of January  2013 with their mother.

[86] In  response to a question from the court as to which  legislation should  govern, counsel  for Mr. Hansen  mentioned the paramountcy  principle, but took the position that the court should apply the law that is in the best interests of the children.   Both counsel  made reference to the new Act in submissions, but no argument  was made that reflected the practical differences between the federal and provincial  statutes.

- [87] Under the previous provincial legislation, although  somewhat different factors were emphasized from those in the Divorce Act , the orders sought would have  been made in the same terms - custody,  access, and primary residence.  Now the terms are substantially  different.
- [88] Section 192 of the new Act provides:
- (1) Subject to the Divorce Act (Canada) the Supreme Court has jurisdiction in all matters under this Act.
- (2) Subject to the Divorce Act (Canada), the Supreme Court continues to have jurisdiction in all matters respecting marriage and divorce.
- (3) Nothing in this Act limits or restricts the inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to act in a parens patriae capacity.
- [89] Obviously,  there is as yet no authority  on the interaction of the Divorce Act and the new Act , but the relationship between the Divorce Act and the FRA has been the subject of judicial consideration.  In Vaandering v. Vaandering (1988), 33 B.C.L.R. (2d) 118 (S.C.), Davies J. considered whether  to make an order for spousal maintenance under the Divorce Act or the FRA .  He held that where orders in family matters can be sought  under either the provincial legislation or the Divorce Act , and where there is no operational incompatibility, there is a discretion to use either act, but it is preferable to make the order under  the Divorce Act and under the provincial act only  in the alternative  (see also Manj v. Manj ,  2002 BCSC 450; Vandher v. Vandher [1995] B.C.J. No. 600 (S.C.)).

[90] Where operational inconsistency  exists, the doctrine of paramountcy  applies and the order will be made under the Divorce Act : Spiers v. Spiers , (1995), 15 B.C.L.R. (3d) 148.

[91] The Court of Appeal dealt with the relationship  between the Divorce Act and the Family Relations Act in the context  of mobility and primary residence in Hejzlar v. Mitchell-Hejzlar 2011 BCCA 230 at paras. 18 - 21.  The court said:

Neither s. 16 of the Divorce Act nor s. 35 of the Family Relations Act admits a freestanding order concerning the primary residence of a child.  It is clear that for such an order to be made under those sections, the court must first make an order determining either custody or access.  This court, in Levesque v. Lapointe (1993), 44 R.F.L. (3d) 316, recognized the parens patriae jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of British Columbia as permitting an order deemed necessary to ensure a child's best interests.  Nonetheless, it is preferable to root an order in legislation where legislation covers the subject matter. For this reason it is prudent for an order of divorce to include, at least, an order setting out the essential nature of the child's custody when custody has already been resolved in a separation agreement, thereby clothing a court with authority to deal with specific, non-custodial, non-access issues arising in future.

It might be thought, in this case, that s. 32 of the Family Relations Act clothes the court with authority to deal with primary residence.  Section 32 applies to guardianship situations.  Of course, custody provisions cover the entire bundle of responsibilities for the child such that one would not expect s. 32 to figure at all where, as here, the parties agree on joint custody.  If this were simply a matter of guardianship, s. 32 would have allowed the judge to consider primary residence, through directions, but this is a case in which the greater concept of custody was agreed.

...

The preferable basis for consideration of a child mobility issue is s. 16 of the Divorce Act where available, as the federal legislation is paramount (or where a custody order under s. 16 already exists, s. 17).

What to do?  The parties clearly are in agreement that they will raise the child under the cloak of joint custody.  To regularize the order and bring the issues on appeal properly to this court under the legislation discussed in the leading case of Gordon v. Goertz and in subsequent authorities, I am of the view we should order joint custody for the child, opening the way to direct consideration of the issue of the child's primary residence.  Counsel did not object to this course.

[92] In  that case, there was an agreement for joint custody.   In  the present case, there is no formal agreement but the parties agree that they  want joint custody.

[93] In  each statute,  the only concern  now is the best interests of the children. Whereas the FRA stated that the best interests of the child were paramount,  the new Act , like the Divorce Act , says those interests are the only  consideration.  This is so, even if this situation is treated as one of a change in primary residence rather  than an initial order (s. 16(8) and s. 17(5) of the Divorce Act ; s. 37(1) and s. 69(5)(b) of the new Act ).

[94] The Divorce Act leaves the consideration of what is in the best interests of the children to the consideration of judges, aided by the evidence they  have heard, their observations of the witnesses, their common sense, and an extensive  history  of case law.  The best interests of the children  may be considered in the context  of the myriad of individual and complex relationships and factors that  underlie that concept. This is also reflected in the phrase in s. 16(8) giving context  to the consideration:

...the courts shall take into consideration only the best interests of the child of the marriage as determined by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the child.

[95] Under the new Act, a list of factors is set out that 'must'  be considered when assessing the best interests of the children,  an analysis which is to be undertaken  in the context  of protecting 'the child's physical,  psychological and emotional safety, security  and well-being'  (s. 37(3)).  As already noted, the listed factors are a composite of considerations addressed by courts in case law under the Divorce Act and the FRA. While common sense might suggest that there should be no incompatibility in the concept of the 'best interests of the children',  whether  the analysis is undertaken  under the Divorce Act or the new Act , it remains to be seen how the change from 'paramount'  under  the FRA to 'only'  will be interpreted, and how the qualifying  child-centered phrase in s. 37(3) will influence  the practicalities of decision making.

[96] Since both federal and provincial legislation are pleaded in this case, I am of the view that the course of action suggested in Hejzlar is the appropriate one - that is, there should  be an order for joint custody  under the Divorce Act , with

consideration given to primary residence.  Thus  I will address the best interests of the children under  the Divorce Act .

- [97] As a matter of caution,  however,  as the parties were not in a position to seek a divorce at the time of trial, I will also consider the sections of the new Act that are potentially  applicable.
- [98] I  will  go through  the list of factors in s. 37 which relate to the best interests of the children,  bearing in mind that  s. 37(3) states that  an order is not in the best interests of a child unless  it protects, to the greatest extent  possible, the child's physical,  psychological and emotional safety,  security and well-being.   As well, s. 37(4) states that conduct is relevant  only  if it substantially  affects a listed factor, and only  to the extent  it affects that  factor.  This is similar to s. 16(9) of the Divorce Act .  There  is no such conduct  that is relevant  in the circumstances here.  I will touch upon this again later in these reasons.
- [99] Considering each of the factors under s. 37(2):
4. (a) the child's health and emotional w ell-being: I  am satisfied that each parent is capable of protecting both children's health  and emotional well-being,  and has done so while the children  have been in their respective care.
5. (b) the children's view s,  unless inappropriate to consider them: the children are very  young,  and closely  bonded to each parent.  Their young  ages make it inappropriate to seek their views.
6. (c) the nature and strength of the relationships betw een  the children and significant persons in the children's lives: each parent has family members and friends with whom the children  are bonded, but aside from his mother,  Mr. Hansen's family is in Alberta.  Ms. Mantei's family is in Regina.
7. (d) the history of the children's care: I  am satisfied Ms. Mantei had the primary child care role in the each child's early  infant life, that Mr. Hansen began to share more significantly  in child care, particularly with the little boy, after the move to Nelson, and that since separation, each parent has been fully  involved  in discharging all the parental responsibilities for each child when  in their respective care.
8. (e) the children's need for stability, given their ages and stages of development: the children,  particularly  the little boy who will be starting kindergarten,  require a stable structure  and schedule.   The little girl's

requirements  center presently  around her developmental  delays which would be best served by consistent professional care.  Such structures are available in Nelson or in Regina.

- (f) the ability of each person ... to exercise his or her responsibilities : both parties are loving and capable parents and able to discharge all of the responsibilities listed in s. 41.
- (g) and (h) impact of family violence: other than the one incident that precipitated the separation, there is no indication of family  violence and neither party or counsel  suggested that this was a consideration.
- (i) the appropriateness of an arrangement that w ould require the child's guardians to cooperate on issues affect the children, including w hether requiring cooperation w ould increase any risks to the safety, security, or w ell-being of the children or other family members: the parties have shown themselves capable of cooperating in the best interests of the children,  notwithstanding  their difficulties with each other, and there is no suggestion of risk to the children or other family members.
- (j) any civil or criminal proceeding relevant to the child's safety, security or w ell-being :   this is not relevant  in the  present circumstances.
- [100] Neither party alleges that violence is a problem or that  the children have ever been in harm's way,  but given the emphasis in the new Act on family violence and the wide encompassing definition contained in s. 1, it may be that a court must  now address the potential for such a concern in any event.   Obviously,  courts have always been concerned with the potential for violence and harm to spouses and children.   It  would be unfortunate  if courts are now compelled to hear details of past allegations that neither party contends  is presently  relevant  to issues involving  the children but which  could, in some cases, hinder the restoration and development  of a growing cooperative relationship, a development  that would obviously  be in the best interests of the children.
- [101] There has been only one incident of physical contact  which I would  not term 'violence',  but the little boy was in the vicinity  when it occurred and was apparently inadvertently  knocked over.  The argument  that led to separation was accompanied by anger on both parts and Mr. Hansen  reacted inappropriately by grabbing and pushing Ms. Mantei.  This was precipitated by his concern for the document  he was working on which was essential to the continued  livelihood of the paper, and which he felt Ms. Mantei was compromising by pulling  out the plug of the computer.   This

was an isolated incident in the heat of the moment,  and Mr. Hansen  took the step of embarking on an extended period of counselling.   The incident was brief, not repeated, and the children were never  in danger.

[102] In  this case, after hearing both parties, I accept that the potential for family violence is not a concern.

- [103] I  will  now turn  to the  consideration set out in s.16(10) of the Divorce Act :

In making an order under this section, the court shall give effect to the principle that a child of the marriage should have as much contact with each spouse as is consistent with the best interests of the child and, for that purpose, shall take into consideration the willingness of the person for whom custody is sought to facilitate such contact.

- [104] The considerations set out in the new Act regarding willingness  to cooperate in the context  of an initial application for a parenting arrangement  are not as explicit as those in the Divorce Act .  Section 40(2) assumes consultation  between guardians, but s. 37(2)(i) and s. 40(4) of the new Act are more cautious in their approach to cooperative arrangements,  seeming to assume the court would not, without  statutory  prompting, consider the potential for strife and/or violence and might carelessly order the equivalent  of joint custody in an inappropriate situation.
- [105] There are other sections, however,  that refer to cooperation as a desirable end.  Section 199 provides that a court must  ensure that a proceeding is conducted:
3. (a) with as little delay and formality as possible, and
4. (b) in a manner that strives to
5. (i) minimize conflict between, and if appropriate, promote cooperation
6. by, the parties, and
7. (ii) protect children and parties from family violence.
- [106] Section 69(4)(ii) lists a consideration in the context  of relocation that is somewhat similar to s. 16(10) of the Divorce Act .  I t  is of some assistance in the circumstances  here, since it deals with the movement  of one guardian where both guardians have substantially  equal parenting time:

the relocating guardian has proposed reasonable and workable arrangements to preserve the relationship between the children and the

child's other guardians, persons who are entitled to contact with the child, and other persons who have a significant role in the children's life.

[107] Thus,  willingness  to facilitate contact with the other parent is a relevant consideration under either Act , and is an explicit and important one in the Divorce Act.

[108] The geographical separation of these parents, given the very  young  ages of the children,  is unfortunate.   Mr. Hansen  blames Ms. Mantei for leaving Nelson permanently  when  they  had decided together  it was the town in which they  wished to raise their children.   Ms. Mantei blames Mr. Hansen  for shutting  down the paper and leaving her without  a means to support herself  in Nelson.

- [109] Nevertheless,  each parent in this case has shown  him or herself to be generous in encouraging  and facilitating a relationship with the other parent, although  each says his or her plan for shared contact with the children  is the more generous one and/or best for the children.   Although  there have  been disagreements when Ms. Mantei has wished to extend her time with the children beyond the agreed-to time, the parties have,  to their great credit, worked it out on each occasion.
- [110] The next  concept which  must be considered, given the changes in terminology  under  the new Act, is guardianship.
- [111]  The Divorce Act , which deals only  with spouses (except with leave of the court, see s. 16(3)), does not contemplate  orders for guardianship, only  custody and access.  The FRA , and now the new Act , deal with parents and with a wider class of persons with potential relationships to the children.   Under s. 25 of the FRA , 'guardians' were both guardians of the person of the child and guardians of the estate of a child, and by definition a parent was a guardian.  Parents were joint guardians until  separation, continued  to be joint guardians of the child's estate, and the parent with care and control  of the child was sole guardian unless  a court ordered otherwise.  A person granted custody under  the Divorce Act became the

sole guardian of the child under  s. 27(4) of the FRA. An order for joint custody  under the Divorce Act would therefore  mean both parents were guardians under  the FRA .

[112] Both parents are automatically  guardians of the child under the new Act , and remain so even after separation.  Section 53 provides for guardianship  in the event of the death of one of the parents.   However,  the word 'guardianship'  now includes the exercise of parental responsibilities under  a parenting arrangement  that includes responsibilities that  used to follow  upon a custody  order, and in fact, still do follow upon a custody  order under the Divorce Act.

[113] In Anson v. Anson (1987), 10 B.C.L.R. (2d) 357, the court discussed the differences between custody and guardianship and the interaction  of the two types of orders.  The order under  appeal in that case - one of sole custody  to the mother and joint guardianship - had been made under  the FRA. The appellate judge, after a careful examination  of the meaning of the terms 'custody'  and 'guardianship', decided that  the trial judge had erred in concluding  that 'custody'  meant physical possession of the child.  She therefore  made an order for joint guardianship and joint custody,  with 'physical  care and control  to Mrs. Anson and reasonable access to Mr. Anson'.

[114] As a statutory  concept, 'guardianship'  is a creature of provincial legislation. The court in Anson noted that under  the common law, 'guardianship ' was held to be 'the full  bundle of rights and duties voluntarily  assumed by an adult  regarding an infant  akin to those naturally  arising from parenthood',  subject to specific statutory restrictions or limits imposed by a court.  In Anson , the court went on to say:

If a child has more than one guardian and those guardians cannot agree, either guardian can seek directions from the Court as to the proper exercise of the guardians' rights or as to the means of fulfilling the guardians' duties in the best interests of the child.

- [115] The court described an order for joint custody as one in which:

the parents continue to share the same duties, rights, responsibilities and input as cohabiting parents save and except for those responsibilities of everyday parenting that go with physical care and control.  Usually, neither custodian is given final decision-making authority.  The parties have to consult with each other and decide what is best for the child.  If they cannot

agree, they can seek the help of a professional third party or apply to the court for direction.

- [116] In  the years following  the Anson decision, since the Divorce Act and FRA were fairly harmonious  in their operation, orders for sole or joint custody under  both or either Act , together with joint guardianship orders became common, often  without the relevant Act being specified (leading to later applications to clarify  which Act had been used) with convenient  and standard models of guardianship with varying  terms. Of the two most common models, both left the decision making power with the parent with primary residence, one simply requiring consultation  ('the  Horn model'), and the other requiring consultation  with a right of review given to the other parent ('the Joyce model').
- [117]  The new Act is not easily and conveniently  compatible with the Divorce Act because the concept of guardianship in the new Act subsumes the concept of custody.   It  may become apparent that  orders respecting children should  no longer be sought  or made under both Acts , and as the Divorce Act must be pleaded if a marriage is to be dissolved, and as the federal legislation is paramount,  orders under that Act alone may become more prevalent.
- [118] The situation in the present case, where both parents wish to have orders for joint custody and joint guardianship,  means that this court does not have to deal with the question of what  rights and responsibilities remain in the non-custodial  parent in the face of an order for sole custody  under the Divorce Act , when  the non-custodial parent continues  to be, by statute, a guardian under the expanded concept of guardianship in the new Act .
- [119]  The new Act continues  each parent's status as a guardian after separation. This action began under the FRA and has now been forced into the new scheme because there is no transitional  provision.  The practical effect of the operation of the Divorce Act , the FRA and the new Act are no different in the circumstances of this particular case.  However,  since an order for guardianship is sought  in the pleadings the court must consider whether  it is necessary to construct  an order in which custody  and guardianship do not conflict with each other.  This will depend to some

extent  on the wishes of the parties, since the provincial scheme is so new, and since counsel  did not address this question specifically.  I will discuss this further  below.

## RESULT

[120] It  must be obvious from the discussion above that both parents are devoted to the children and each would  provide a suitable primary residence for them.

[121] However, I am of the view that the best interests of the children,  insofar as 'best interests' can be fostered where the parents live so far apart, are served by having  their primary residence with their father  in Nelson, whether  the analysis  is done under the Divorce Act or the new Act .   Although  they have spent long periods of time with their mother in Regina over the past year, their home has been in Nelson since the fall of 2010.  The family  chose Nelson as the place they wanted to reside and raise their children.   Mr. Hansen remains in the family  home, working in a job that his manager describes as secure, flexible, and family-oriented.   Their life in Nelson is already stable with supportive friends and relatives.   Mr. Hansen has shown himself to be a wonderful  father since the separation, something  Ms. Mantei was generous in admitting.  There is no question that he has put the children ahead of any other concern.   Mr. Hansen's mother is available and willing to assist in child care whenever  requested.

[122] Ms. Mantei chose to leave Nelson  and return  to Regina permanently.   She is establishing herself there in a new career.  While she has the support of a close family in Regina, her life is taking on new dimensions and is in a state of development.   While she is determined to put her children  first, and I am satisfied that she would  make every  effort to do that, she does not now have the same stability and predictability in her life that Mr. Hansen  does.

## ORDERS

[123] There will be an order for joint custody  under the Divorce Act , with primary residence to Mr. Hansen.

[124] The order for joint custody with primary residence to Mr. Hansen,  with extended periods of time spent with Ms. Mantei as specified below, will include the following  terms.  In  drafting the first term I have reference to the concept of 'custody' set out above in Anson , also referred to Hejlzar :

1.  Each parent will have the same duties, rights, responsibilities and input in respect of the children  which they  had while co-parenting, except for those responsibilities of everyday  parenting that go with physical care and control of the children,  which will be exercised by each parent during their respective times with the children.
2.  In  the event  of the death of a spouse, the surviving  spouse will have sole custody of the children,  and the children will reside with the surviving  spouse.
3.  Each parent will have the obligation to advise the other parent of any matters of a significant nature  affecting the children.
4.  Each parent will have the obligation to discuss with the other parent any significant decisions to be made about the health  (except emergency decisions), education, religious instruction  and general welfare of the children.
5.  The parents will have the obligation to discuss significant decisions respecting the children with each other and the obligation to try to reach agreement on those decisions.
6.  In  the event that the parents cannot reach agreement on a significant decision respecting the children despite their best efforts, the parent with primary residence will be entitled to make those decisions and the other parent will have the right to apply to the court to review any  decision the parent considers contrary  to the best interests of the children.
7.  Each parent will have the right to obtain information concerning  the children directly  from third parties, including but not limited to teachers, counsellors,  medical professionals,  and third party care givers.

[125] The arrangement for Ms. Mantei's access to the children,  or to use the phrase from the new Act , 'parenting time', will follow the proposal set forth  by Mr. Hansen, as reflected in para. 41 above.  While Ms. Mantei's proposed arrangement  is very generous,  particularly  with respect to additional time in the summer,  Mr. Hansen's  is more practical in terms of school and program attendance  and is thus in the children's best interests now and as they  grow older.  The parties may adjust the schedule by mutual  agreement.

[126] Exchanges of the children  will take place at Mrs. Hansen's farm in Alberta, unless  otherwise agreed by the parties.

[127] An order for joint guardianship was sought in the pleadings, and as already mentioned,  the concept of guardianship can only  be dealt with under provincial legislation, which is now the new Act.

[128] As mentioned above, s. 53 of the new Act provides that in the event  of the death of a parent, and in the absence of an agreement or order stating otherwise, the surviving  parent will be the only guardian of the children.   Here, both parents want the other parent to be the children's only  guardian upon either parent's death, so that order will be made.

[129] An order for guardianship now necessitates a consideration of parental responsibilities within  a parenting arrangement.   However,  as stated in Heljzar , where an order for joint custody  has been made, the whole  'bundle of responsibilities' has already been dealt with.

- [130] Insofar  as some of the listed responsibilities in s. 41 are incidents of every  day parenting that go with physical  care and control  of the children,  it may be that the parties will wish to include  some specific terms under  the concept of guardianship. However, those terms cannot  conflict with the order for joint custody.
- [131] In  general, each parent remains a guardian of the children by statute and may exercise the parenting responsibilities listed in s. 41 respecting the children  when the children are in their care that are not inconsistent  with the order for joint custody with primary residence to Mr. Hansen  made under the Divorce Act .
- [132] Some of the listed parental responsibilities in s. 41 are already covered explicitly  by the custody  order.
- [133] Section 41(a) ( making day-to-day decisions affecting the child and having day-to-day care, control and supervision of the child ) is subject to the first term set out above in the custody  order.

- [134] Section 41(b) ( making decisions respecting w here  t he child w ill reside ) is not consistent with the order for custody  and primary residence, as the court has now made an order for city of primary residence, although  obviously  not house address.
- [135] Section 41(e) ( making decisions respecting the child's cultural, linguistic, religious and spiritual upbringing and heritage) and s. 41(f) ( giving, refusing, or withdraw ing  consent to medical, dental and other health-related treatments for the child) are already covered by the fourth  term of the custody  order.
- [136] Section 41(j) ( requesting and receiving from third parties health, education or other information respecting the child) is already covered by the seventh  term of the custody  order.

[137] Some decisions that  fall under  the remaining enumerated  headings of 'parental  responsibilities' will be minor decisions involved  with daily parenting;  some could be significant.  Section 40(3) of the new Act provides for the allocation of parental responsibilities between guardians.  Such allocation is not easily applied in this case where there is an order for joint custody  with primary residence to one parent, but where the parents will each have large blocks of time with the children.   It is more appropriate to rely on the requirement  for consultation  contained in s. 40(2).

- [138] Depending on the significance of the decision, some will require consultation in order to conform  to the order for joint custody.   The following  subsections of s. 41 will very likely,  but not inevitably  in every  circumstance,  require consultation:
2. (c) making decisions respecting with whom  the child will live and associate,
3. (d) making decisions respecting the child's education and participation in extracurricular  activities, including  the nature,  extent  and location, ...
4. (g) applying for a passport, licence, permit, benefit, privilege or other thing for the child,
5. (h) giving, refusing or withdrawing  consent for the child, if consent  is required,

(i) receiving and responding to any notice that a parent or guardian is entitled or required by law to receive, and

...

- (k) legal and financial  proceedings and interests.
- [139] For instance,  in s. 41(c), some associations will be significant, some may simply involve  childhood playmates;  in s. 41(d), a choice of school is significant; an individual field trip may not be; in (g) and (h), some benefits and consents  might be fleeting and of a minor nature,  some might be very  important.   While one could hope that common sense would prevail, the existence of a list of parenting responsibilities that can or should  be allocated sets up the potential for disputes in the very situation where parents are cooperating for the sake of the children,  that is, where  joint custody  is ordered under  the Divorce Act. In  any event,  the sixth term of the custody order would govern disputes.
- [140] The foregoing discussion on the interaction  of a guardianship order with the custody  order has been done without  the benefit of the submissions of counsel. Given that the new Act came into effect on the first day of trial, counsel were not in a position to address the precise terms of the orders they  sought or to consider the interaction of orders under the Divorce Act and the new Act .  I f  the parties wish to have a guardianship  order with specific terms that relate to some of the subsections of s. 41, or if there are other terms that should  be amended, added, or clarified, counsel  may arrange to address these issues through  the registry.  If there are terms that the parties agree to, they  may be included  in any  order by consent.
- [141] Otherwise,  the custody order under the Divorce Act will prevail, and the only order respecting guardianship will be that each parent  is a guardian of the children, subject to the custody order, with no allocation of parenting  responsibilities under s. 41 of the new Act to either parent,  and each parent becomes the sole guardian of the children upon the death of the other parent.
- [142] The parties have  now been separated for more than  one year, so counsel should  include an order for divorce in the order to be entered.

[143] In  general, costs in family matters follow the event.   However,  this is a case where each parent has a legitimate and well-founded  case to put forward.   It  would not be in the interests of justice to pronounce  one parent successful  in this action and one not.  The only  consideration is the best interests of the children,  and as I have made clear, the children would  be well served living primarily with either parent. Given the parents' determination  to live apart, and their equal devotion to their children,  a decision had to be made for the children by a court.  In  these circumstances  it is appropriate that the parties bear their own costs.
