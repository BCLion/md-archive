2024 BCPC 237 (CanLII)

## I. OVERVIEW AND POSITION OF THE PARTIES

- [1] P.J.A. (the 'Father') and A.F.A., also known as A.F.P. (the 'Mother'), are former spouses and parents of a four-year-old boy, I.P.V.A. ('I.'), born [redacted for publication].
- [2] The parties married in 2019 and separated on August 17, 2023, after a sevenyear relationship. Their separation followed a heated argument at the home of the Father's grandparents that ensued after the Mother accused the Father's parents (and I.'s grandparents) P.A. and V.A. of having molested I. during a diaper change at a family gathering in October 2021.
- [3] This argument was the tipping point for the Mother in her relationship with the Father and his extended family. The Mother fled the family home taking I. with her and moved into a transition home in the Fraser Valley.
- [4] The Mother, in the ensuing family law proceedings, alleges she was the victim of domestic violence in the home, that I. was unsafe around the Father due to the Father's open 'drug use', that I. was unsafe in the care of his paternal grandparents owing to their abuse, and that the Father failed to protect I. from his grandparents.
- [5] Beginning in late-September 2023, the Father began having parenting time with I. under an interim order made at a family management conference ('FMC') on September 19, 2023 (the 'FMC Order'). Owing to the Mother's claims of domestic violence and child safety concerns, the hearing judge imposed a number of restrictions on the Father's parenting time with I. under the FMC Order, including Term 7 ('Term 7') that required the Father to supervise I.'s visits with his paternal grandparents.
- [6] The current order for parenting time was made at a family settlement conference on January 10, 2024 (the 'FSC Order'). By that point in time, the Mother agreed to the removal of a number of restrictions on the Father's parenting time (except Term 7) and she further agreed to an increase in his parenting time to include alternating weekends, and the equal sharing of parental responsibilities.

- [7] Since the parties' separation, the Mother became involved in a new relationship and is expecting her second child from that relationship. The Mother seeks an order to relocate with I. to live in [redacted for publication], where her partner lives and works and where she has close friends. She proposes that she continue to have I.'s primary residence and that the Father have parenting time of one week per month.
- [8] This relocation plan is opposed by the Father as unworkable and not in I.'s best interests, given the child's close bond with the Father and his extended family. He seeks an order for equal parenting time on a week on and week off rotation.
- [9] The Mother's further position is that Term 7 should continue indefinitely owing to her safety concerns for I. if left unsupervised with his paternal grandparents. She is amenable to the continued sharing of parental responsibilities provided she has the final say on decision-making.
- [10] In response, the Father asserts that the Mother's safety concerns for I. are baseless, that Term 7 interferes with his parenting time and is unnecessary. He agrees to share parental responsibilities, but seeks the final say in light of the Mother's post separation conduct.
- [11] The trial proceeded July 22 to 26, 2024. Closing Submissions were heard on September 13, 2024, so the Mother had the opportunity to further consult with legal counsel.
- [12] Following closing submissions, I advised the party of my finding, with Reasons to follow, that there was no reliable evidence to support the Mother's belief that I.'s paternal grandparents had molested him. I then vacated Term 7 effective immediately. This meant that the Father was no longer bound by the requirement that he supervise I.'s visits with P.A. and V.A. and can rely on his parents for childcare assistance.

## II. HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS

- [13] Twenty interim court orders were made prior to trial. These orders involve the management of the Father's parenting time, the enforcement of the parenting orders,

the allocation of parental responsibilities, and two conduct orders. The balance of the orders were procedural in nature to streamline this case to trial.

- [14] I set out below in summary fashion the litigation chronology to provide context for the issues and the positions taken by the parties at trial.
- [15] After the separation, the Father brought a priority parenting application seeking an order for the non-removal of I. from the Lower Mainland. This was an ex parte application that was heard by Judge McQuillan on August 18, 2024, who granted an interim non-removal order. This order remains in effect.
- [16] On August 28, 2023, the Father filed an Application About A Family Law Matter seeking an order for joint guardianship, equal parenting time, all parental responsibilities, and child support. The Mother filed her Reply on September 5, 2023, opposing all of the relief sought by the Father.
- [17] As touched on above, on September 19 th , 2023, the parties appeared at the FMC before Judge Malfair. At the time of the FMC, the Father had not seen I. for a month and did not know his son's whereabouts. The transcript from the FMC confirms that Judge Malfair understood the Father's opposition to the Mother's allegations of open drug use and family violence in the relationship. However, in making the FMC Order, Judge Malfair reasoned that until there was a hearing on the merits, this order would provide the Father with some parenting time before trial, while at the same time ensuring that the Mother's safety concerns were addressed by the parenting restrictions that were imposed.
- [18] Following the FMC, the Mother brought an application with notice for a protection order alleging family violence against the Father. A conduct order was made by Judge Mengering at the first appearance on this application to minimize the Father's contact with the Mother, except to facilitate child support payments and parenting exchanges under the FMC Order. The hearing was then set for October 18, 2024.
- [19] The parties and counsel for the Mother appeared at the hearing on October 18th. The Mother's application, however, did not proceed and was adjourned generally.

- [20] On November 24, 2023, the parties sought a consent variation of Judge Mengering's conduct order to allow them to have 'further conduct agreements' in writing with respect to parenting. Judge G. Smith granted the variation. The parties then agreed to have a family settlement conference. That was set on January 10, 2024 before Judge Smith.
- [21] By the time of the January settlement conference, the parties were beginning to co-parent their son. In fact, many of the Mother's safety concerns in relation to the Father's parenting of I. had resolved, given the Mother's agreement at the settlement conference to remove most of the safety restrictions that had been put in place on the Father's parenting time under the FMC Order, with the exception of Term 7.
- [22] The Mother also agreed to increase the Father's parenting time to include weekly and alternating weekend overnight parenting time. They agreed to share parental responsibilities equally and to mediate substantive disputes before bringing a court application. Finally, the parties agreed that the Mother would have a right of first refusal if the Father was unable to exercise his parenting time.
- [23] All of these agreements and Term 7 were incorporated into Judge Smith's FSC Order.
- [24] On March 27, 2024, the Mother brought an enforcement application to compel the Father to supervise I. during visits with his paternal grandparents. The Mother's supporting evidence for this application was of questionable reliance -- that being double hearsay evidence of a three-year-old child. As I have gleaned from the Mother's supporting materials, the need for this application came about in response I.'s utterances to a babysitter about P.A. 'wiping I.'s bum' in the bathroom while I. used the toilet at his paternal grandparents' home. It is not surprising the Father opposed the application.
- [25] This hearing proceeded on April 11, 2024 before Judge Dossa. While Judge Dossa made no adverse findings against P.A. or the Father in relation to I.'s bathroom routine at his grandparents' home, Judge Dossa made an interim conduct order that the

Father 'ensure that I. has privacy when using the bathroom at the home of his paternal grandparents'.

- [26] The Father also brought an application to enforce 14 days of missed parenting time. The hearing on this application proceeded before Judge McQuillan on May 30, 2024. Judge McQuillan found the breach, allowed the application, and found that the Father was wrongfully denied parenting time by the Mother. Judge McQuillan then adjourned the issue of make-up parenting time to the trial.
- [27] On June 5, 2024, the Father filed a priority parenting application prohibiting I.'s relocation to [redacted for publication] after he learned the Mother was contemplating the move. The next day, the Mother filed her Response confirming her intention to move to [redacted for publication], stating that she has an offer of a job, family and friends, and 'partner's 'contract job' is in [redacted for publication]'. The Father's application was later adjourned generally.
- [28] On June 6, 2024, the Mother brought an enforcement application to enforce her right of first refusal with respect to I. as she did not want I.'s great-grandmother to babysit him. This application was adjourned over to the trial.

## III. ISSUES

- [29] The parties each consent to a final order for joint-guardianship of I.
- [30] The following are the balance of the issues to be decided at trial:
1.  Is I. unsafe in the care of the Father?
2.  Has I. been sexually or physically abused by his paternal grandparents? Is there an ongoing safety issue for I. to be in their care unsupervised?
3.  Is I. unsafe in the care of his paternal great-grandparents?
4.  Has the Father breached the Mother's right of first refusal by having I.'s great-grandmother babysit him?
5.  What arrangements should be ordered for parenting time and the allocation of parenting responsibilities between the parties for I.?

6.  Should the Mother be permitted to relocate with I. to [redacted for publication]?
7.  Should the Father be granted compensatory parenting time pursuant to Judge McQuillan's finding?
8.   What is the quantum of ongoing child support for I.?
9.  Has the Mother's established her claim for retroactive and ongoing spousal support?

## IV. BACKGROUND OF THE PARTIES

- [31] The Father is 32 years old. He grew up in Coquitlam with his parents and younger brother. The A.'s are a tight knit family. The A.'s are churchgoers who have been parishioners at the same Anglican church in Coquitlam for over 30 years, where the parties were married.
- [32] The Father is close to his parents, grandparents, and younger brother. Since getting his own place after high school, he has made it his practice to see his parents each week and enjoys weekly family dinners at his parents' or grandparents' homes. This routine continued after he began dating the Mother.
- [33] The Father works full-time as a [redacted for publication] for a large commercial bakery, currently earning approximately $73,600 per annum. He has some degree of flexibility with his work in the afternoons, but generally works from 6:00 am (or earlier) until 2:00 pm to coordinate deliveries. He has Wednesdays and Sundays off.
- [34] The Mother is 30 years of age and grew up in the Lower Mainland. Much of her background came through the Father's testimony.
- [35] The Father first met some of the Mother's extended family a few months after they started dating. The Mother's parents are divorced. Both of her parents live in the Lower Mainland, as does her brother. Her sister lives in the Interior.
- [36] For reasons that were unclear to the Father, only his mother-in-law attended their wedding.

- [37] The Mother generally described having a happy relationship with members of her extended family. The Father, however, understood from the Mother that her father had a drinking and substance use problem and was physically abusive towards her when she was growing up. She did not admit that her father was abusive, but confirmed that her father can be harsh.
- [38] The Father described the Mother as an anxious person, noting that he has witnessed his 'fair share' of her bouts of anxiety and panic attacks over the course of their seven-year relationship. The Mother did not dispute the Father's description of her history of panic attacks, but denied having any mental health issues and then produced copies of clinical records at trial that confirmed she had some issues with her mental health in the past.
- [39] The Father understood from the Mother that his mother-in-law had longstanding mental health struggles and was hospitalized in relation to her mental health at one point during the parties' relationship. The Mother neither admitted nor denied the Father's evidence with regard to her own Mother's mental health challenges.
- [40] The Mother became pregnant a short time after they were married. She had a miscarriage and soon after became pregnant with I.
- [41] The Father described the Mother having a number of panic attacks during her pregnancy with I. and panicky behaviours after I. was born. The Father also described two occasions before she was pregnant with I. when the Mother left their residence following an argument. On each of those occasions, she would ordinarily return within a few days and, from his perspective, she would attempt to impose new rules on their relationship.
- [42] The Mother stays with I. during her parenting time at her mother's home, where she and I. have their own bedroom. She is expecting her second child with her current partner, R., a man she has known for approximately a year, who works on contract and lives in [redacted for publication].

- [43] The Mother completed an apprenticeship in horticulture, landscaping and design. Her goal is to find full time work in this field in [redacted for publication].

## V. SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE

- [44] Six witnesses testified at trial. They were the Father, his parents, and greatgrandmother L.A., the Mother, and her friend J.P. The following is a summary of their testimony in relation to the October 2021 diaper-changing incident. This incident is at the core of the Mother's safety concerns for I.

## A)  P.A.

- [45] P.A. described her background and history of caring for children.
- [46] P.A. and her husband, V.A., raised two sons, the Father and their younger son. She ran a small [redacted for publication] business when her children were young. P.A. worked extensively with children through her church, and she regularly provides childcare for her great-nephew, with whom I. is quite close. Currently, she works as an [redacted for publication].
- [47] P.A. was required to undergo criminal records checks and other training for some of the work that she had done through her church and as a [redacted for publication].
- [48] When P.A. first met the Mother, she testified that she liked her very much and believed that she had just met their future daughter-in-law, a prognostication that later materialized when the parties married in June 2019.
- [49] The Mother agreed in cross-examination that her relationship with P.A. had been closer early on and that she had travelled with P.A. to a family vacation home at a lake near Revelstoke. She admitted to having an anxiety bout during that visit, after hearing a disturbing story about P.A.'s brother.
- [50] P.A. characterized the Mother as somewhat of a nervous new mother and being reluctant to leave I. alone with her until his first birthday. On this occasion, P.A. and her husband V.A. watched over I. while the parties were out getting things ready for I.'s

birthday party. P.A. noted that the Mother had not raised any concerns about their care of I. that day.

- [51] She also testified that her relationship with the Mother changed over time, and became particularly strained after Thanksgiving in 2021, when I. was a year old.
- [52] P.A. provided her account of the diaper-changing incident at the family Thanksgiving gathering at her home. She testified that she noticed that I. needed a diaper change and offered to change him and the Mother agreed. P.A. kept a diaperchanging pad under a couch in the living room and used that pad to change I. amid the guests. After removing I.'s diaper, P.A. noticed I. had a rash. She asked V.A. to retrieve the diaper cream from upstairs, which he did.
- [53] The diaper cream P.A. applied to I.'s diaper area was Penaten, which is a thick cream. P.A. applied too much Penaten to I.'s diaper area and asked for V.A.'s assistance. He held up I.'s legs in the air so she could remove some of the excess diaper cream.
- [54] Both P.A. and V.A. found the situation they were in with I. amusing. This prompted V.A. to tell their guests about a time he remembered when he and P.A. were new parents with the Father that involved a messy bowel movement after V.A. administered a suppository to relieve the baby's constipation. This story made everyone laugh, including the Father.
- [55] The Mother was not in the living room during the diaper change and had gone into the kitchen. P.A. was unaware of the Mother's upset after she came out of the kitchen to investigate the laughter. P.A. thought nothing of the diaper change, and went on entertaining their guests.
- [56] P.A. then described a lengthy period after Thanksgiving where she did not see I. or the parties. She testified that she could not understand what was going on or what had happened that led to this estrangement. Neither she nor V.A. saw the Father, the Mother, or I. for at least four or five months until the Spring 2022, when the Mother and Father came over to their home one evening after dropping I. off at L.A.'s home.

[57] During that visit, P.A. testified about the conversation they had with the parties about their estrangement, and as well, the Mother's concerns about the manner in which P.A. had changed I.'s diaper. She noted that her son did most of the talking.

[58] P.A. did not provide much detail in her testimony about what the Mother said to her about the diapering. What was clear from P.A.'s evidence is that she was upset by what the Mother had said to her during that visit, however, she wanted to move on and put this event behind them. She agreed not to change I.'s diaper again. With this agreement, P.A. felt that the issue had been resolved between herself and the Mother.

[59] This resolution was short lived.

- [60] In May 2022, the Mother accused P.A. of 'breaking' their agreement by changing I. into a swimsuit at L.A.'s home. P.A. testified that on that occasion, the Father came over to build a deck at his grandparents' place and brought I. along with him, while the Mother was at work. She was also visiting that day.

[61] P.A. recalled that I. wanted to swim in the pool and that she changed I. into his swimsuit and thought nothing of it.

[62] The Mother arrived unexpectedly after leaving her job early that day. She inquired of the Father and P.A. who had changed I. into his swimsuit, as she noticed that he was not wearing his swim diaper underneath.

- [63] The Mother confronted P.A. in cross-examination, accusing P.A. of breaking her agreement not to change I.'s diaper by changing him into his swimsuit. P.A. disagreed stating that she understood their agreement to mean that she was not to change I.'s diaper and that their agreement did not extend to the act of helping I. change out of his clothes into his swimsuit so he could go into the pool.

[64] After the swimsuit 'incident', another long period of estrangement occurred between the Mother and P.A. P.A. testified that she did not understand why that occurred and was again unaware of the Mother's upset.

[65] On September 27, 2022, P.A. reached out to the Mother with a short text message in an effort to rekindle their relationship. The Mother texted back to P.A. stating, 'you disgust me'. P.A. responded to the Mother's text by stating 'sad to hear that … I've only ever wanted to love you like a daughter'. The Mother replied stating, 'you don't deserve it'. Given the tone and content of the Mother's text messages, it is not surprising that P.A. halted further contact with the Mother.

[66] With the passage of several more months, P.A.'s relationship with the Mother began to normalize again until matters came to a head the morning of August 12, 2023. That morning, P.A. and V.A. dropped by to see L.A. and B.A. for coffee, where they learned that L.A. would be looking after I. that morning.

- [67] The Mother, on seeing her in-laws, asked them to leave. They refused. The Mother made it clear to everyone that would not leave I. in L.A.'s care and go with the Father to their scheduled counselling appointment until both P.A. and V.A. left the premises.

[68] An argument then ensued between P.A., V.A., and the Mother. During the argument, the Mother accused P.A. of molesting I. This was the first time P.A. and V.A. heard this accusation. It angered and upset P.A. P.A. admitted in her testimony that she swore at the Mother and called her 'a lunatic' after hearing the Mother's accusation, which she regretted.

## B)  L.A.

- [69] L.A. is V.A.'s mother, the Father's paternal grandmother, and I.'s great grandmother. L.A. is 81 years old. L.A. watched I. on several occasions when the parties were together as a couple. After the parties' separation, she has watched I. from time to time, including one overnight visit, without any difficulty.
- [70] L.A.'s husband (and I.'s great-grandfather), B.A. is diagnosed with vascular dementia. B.A. is described by L.A. as being largely independent in his daily living, but has short-term memory lapses. When queried in cross-examination by the Mother about her ability to care for both I. and her husband, L.A. testified that she is in excellent

health, and is fully capable of looking after both of them, adding that B.A. is 'able to care for himself independently'.

[71] L.A. was largely unaware of the reasons for relationship difficulties between the Mother and P.A. until the August 12 th  argument at her home. L.A. provided a brief account of the argument in her evidence in chief. She took I. into her backyard, away from the argument that had erupted soon after the parties arrived with I. She described the Mother as 'having a meltdown' during the argument with her in-laws. L.A. recalled that the argument ended with the Mother pulling I. away from her, and leaving her home with I. and the Father. It was clear to L.A. that I. did not want to leave and that I. was upset and crying.

[72] This argument marked the first time that L.A. became aware of the accusations of abuse that the Mother made against P.A. and her son, V.A.

[73] In cross-examination, L.A. stated that she was unaware of the existence of any agreement between the parties that P.A. could not be present at her home when L.A. was watching I.

[74] Since the argument on August 12, 2023, L.A. has neither seen nor spoken to the Mother.

## C)  V.A.

[75] V.A. described the close nature of the A. family that includes his nieces and nephews, and their children.

[76] He described having a good relationship with the Mother, noting that they both enjoyed playing video games together at his home. He also described the Mother in the years prior to I.'s birth as being like the daughter they never had. He stated that he and his wife, P.A., would see the Father and Mother at their home a couple of times each week. They went on several family outings, including trips to a family vacation home in Revelstoke, which everyone enjoyed.

[77] He provided brief evidence about his father B.A.'s dementia, noting that he could not recall discussing his father's condition where the Mother was present. V.A. explained that while his father experienced some episodes of significant confusion at the outset of his diagnosis, he stated that B.A. had a 'shocking improvement' in his memory after medication adjustments were made by his doctor.

[78] V.A. also described I.'s diaper change during the 2021 family Thanksgiving gathering. V.A.'s description of the diaper change largely accorded with the description provided by P.A. in her testimony. He confirmed that P.A. had applied too much diaper cream to I.'s bottom and that he held I.'s legs up so she could remove the excess cream from his diaper area.

[79] V.A., likewise, recalled two extended time-periods where neither he nor P.A. saw I. or the parties. He described the overall relationship between P.A. and the Mother as 'strained', noting that he never knew 'which A. would show up' at family gatherings, stating that sometimes she was friendly and other times she was cold and standoffish.

[80] He also gave his account of the argument with the Mother on August 12, 2023 that, for the most part, accorded with the P.A.'s description of what had happened. He also confirmed that the Father was present and that the Father recorded the argument on his cell phone. He was unaware of the Mother's abuse allegations until this argument.

## D)  The Father

[81] After I.'s birth, the Father noticed a change in the Mother's attitude towards his own mother, stating that he formed this impression from the way the Mother interacted with P.A., stating that the Mother did not like having P.A. around after I. was born. It seemed to the Father that P.A. was like a stranger to the Mother. He could not understand what had happened, as they had been previously been close.

[82] The first time the Mother allowed his parents to look after I. was on I.'s first birthday. He remembered there were no complaints or issues that were expressed by the Mother with their care of I. on that occasion, as they got ready for the party.

[83] The Father also described seeing a change in the Mother's overall attitude and outlook after I.'s birth, noting that things she once found funny were no longer funny to her and that she disliked his dark sense of humour.

[84] He recalled that the Mother began to complain that she and I. were being followed during outings in the community. She worried about I. being kidnapped at the park, and on one instance, the Mother called the Father at work to report her concerns, and she had called police to report her fears of kidnapping. None of these statements were challenged by the Mother in cross-examination.

[85] The Father testified about the Thanksgiving diaper-changing incident. He was present in the living room when his mother, P.A., changed I.'s diaper, with help from his father. The Father's evidence echoed the evidence provided by P.A. and V.A., adding that he remembered seeing 'an exorbitant amount of cream applied' to I.'s diaper area by his mother, and that 'Dad held his legs up as Mom tried to wipe off the cream'.

[86] The Father testified that he, the Mother, and I. went home that evening stating, 'nothing was said and we went on with our lives'. He was unaware of the Mother's concerns of abuse until and in the course of an argument a few weeks later. It was during this argument that the Mother disclosed to the Father that she saw P.A. 'inappropriately touching I. and applying diaper cream' and 'my dad laughing about it and tickling his balls'. She told the Father she was disgusted and angry this had happened to their son.

[87] The Father did not believe the Mother's accusations and told her as such. He wanted the Mother to discuss what she had seen with his parents but she flatly refused.

[88] He testified that his parents were then 'cold turkey cut off' by the Mother from seeing them and that he was not 'allowed by the Mother' to raise the incident with his parents otherwise she would 'take I. and leave'. The Father treated this directive as serious as the Mother had left the home after arguments before I. was born and on one occasion after I. was born and taking I. with her. The Father capitulated and did not see

his parents on his own or with I., which caused a significant strain on the parties' relationship.

- [89] This period of estrangement lasted for several months. In this intervening period, the Father continued to spend time with his brother (whom the Mother approved of) and his grandparents (whom the Mother also approved of). The parties also began marital counselling. Although the Father disbelieved the Mother's allegations of abuse, he testified that he continued to 'stand by his wife', but became frustrated with the Mother as he could see 'zero action' on her part to fix her issue with his parents and because she forbade him to see them.
- [90] The parties eventually met with V.A. and P.A. at their home to discuss the diaperchanging incident. This occurred at some point in the Spring 2022. He dropped I. off at his grandmother (L.A.'s) home and then took the Mother to meet with his parents. He did most of the talking. He described the Mother as not saying much, stating that he had to prompt the Mother to express to them in her own words what the Mother felt they did was inappropriate during the diaper change.
- [91] The Father was not clear in his recollection of what the Mother said to P.A. and V.A. about the diaper change after being prompted by the Father to explain her concerns to them. He understood from his own mother's reaction that she was upset by what the Mother had said, but she had agreed '100%' to never to do another diaper change for I. again. The Father described the Mother's reaction to the agreement as if a 'switch' went on and she went 'back to her old self almost immediately'.
- [92] The Father felt the relationship between the Mother and his parents had improved somewhat after this discussion. He testified that this was short-lived, as there was another changing incident in May 2022 that upset the Mother. The incident in question was the act of P.A. changing I. into a swimsuit at L.A.'s house. This led to another long period of estrangement.
- [93] When questioned in cross-examination by the Mother about the Father's whereabouts that day, and why he did not change I. into his swimsuit himself, the

Father explained he was busy building a deck and that it took at most 30 seconds for P.A. to change I. into his swimsuit. In any event, both he and his great-grandmother were nearby.

[94] The Father also testified that the Mother left with I. for an extended period in 2022 (without providing the timeframe or an explanation of what led to this separation) to stay at her aunt and uncles' home. He was not challenged by the Mother on this evidence.

[95] On another occasion in 2022, the Father described the Mother leaving their home after an argument about P.A. and then being contacted by police about the Mother's wellbeing after the Mother had contacted the police about P.A. The Mother's interaction with police added to the Father's growing concerns about the state of the Mother's overall mental health.

- [96] He then began to record conversations with the Mother without her knowledge. The Mother challenged the Father in cross-examination regarding his purpose and use of his recordings. He replied stating that his motivation for doing so was to use the recordings to convince the Mother's doctor that she needed mental health supports. None of these recordings were tendered in evidence.

[97] The Father also testified that the Mother went on a 13-day vacation to Lebanon on her own with explicit instructions that he not visit his parents. He agreed to her request and did not see his parents with I. during her absence. The Father looked after I. during this time-period.

[98] This period of estrangement following the swimsuit changing incident continued well into 2023 until Mother's Day in May, when the Father planned to visit his parents and the Mother asked to come along with him. On that visit, he described, much to his relief, that P.A. and the Mother agreed to put their differences aside and reconcile.

[99] This reconciliation did not last long.

[100] The Father provided his account of the argument at his grandparents' home the morning of August 12, 2023. He recalled that he and the Mother arrived that morning to drop off I. so the parties could attend a counselling appointment. He described the argument after his parents refused the Mother's demand that they leave, and that before the argument escalated, the Mother accused P.A. of molesting their son, adding this was the first time the Mother confronted his parents with this accusation.

[101] The Father admitted he audio recorded the argument between his parents and the Mother on his cell phone. He explained the reason he did so was because of the accusations the Mother made against his family and because of the Mother's behaviour. The audio recording was played during the Father's evidence in chief.

[102] When confronted in cross-examination about the recording itself, the Father confirmed that he audio recorded, but did not film, the argument with his camera, stating that he used his cell phone as a Dictaphone, i.e , to preserve a record of what had transpired.

[103] In response to further questioning, he described seeing the Mother 'rush' toward P.A. with her fists balled up, and from what he saw, he described the Mother as the aggressor. He described the Mother's fist-balling motion as an assaultive action that was suggestive to him that the Mother was getting ready to fight.

[104] After the argument, the parties missed their counselling session and returned home with I. The Father testified that he told the Mother that what she said to his parents at his grandparents' home was inappropriate and wrong, that he was hurt, and that he felt she did not care about their relationship. The Father stated that the Mother then told him that she did not believe she had done anything wrong, or had misbehaved, and that it was his family who had acted inappropriately.

[105] He testified that he was 'blindsided' by the Mother leaving him with I. on August 17 th .

[106] The Father filed his Application About a Family Law Matter almost immediately after separation and took the Parenting After Separation course as soon as he could, having completed it on September 5, 2023.

[107] The Father also testified that an investigation and an assessment was undertaken by the MCFD, after a child protection report had been made against him. This investigation included a home visit by a social worker and a two-hour meeting. He received a letter from the MCFD in February 2024 following the investigation confirming there were no child protection concerns in relation to the Father's parenting of I.

[108] Since their separation, the Father testified that he has repeatedly encountered difficulty with the Mother in exercising his parenting time. He described missing his first scheduled visit with I. after the FMC, and that the Mother withheld his parenting time for two weeks in the Spring 2024, due to the Mother's concerns in having his greatgrandmother care for I. while he was at work. This led to the Father's successful enforcement application against the Mother before Judge McQuillan in May 2024.

## E)  The Mother

[109] The Mother provided a different account of I.'s diaper change at the Thanksgiving gathering at her in-laws home in October 2021. In describing this incident, she testified that she accepted P.A.'s offer to change I.'s diaper and understood that I. would be changed on a changing pad that P.A. kept under the couch in the living room for this purpose.

[110] The Mother went to the kitchen to get a cup of coffee and overheard 'something unusual' in the conversation coming from the living room. She 'poked' her head around in the hallway to investigate and could see V.A. holding up I.'s legs and P.A. massaging diaper cream on I.'s genitals. The Mother then overheard V.A. say 'you don't have to play with it, just paint it and move on'. It was a compromising position for I. and she saw P.A. giggling and heard her say this was 'funny'.

[111] The Mother then entered the living room and her in-laws words to the effect of 'whatever was going on' with I. 'is done'. She felt awkward and uncomfortable

confronting her in-laws in this way. A short time later, the Mother told the Father she was not feeling well and they went home with I.

- [112] She admitted that she did not tell the Father for a few weeks about what she had seen during I.'s diaper change because she did not know how to deal with what she had seen and knew this would be upsetting for the Father.
- [113] The Mother stated that it was 'heart-breaking' telling the Father what she saw P.A. do to their son. She admitted they had a lot of fights and arguments after she made the disclosure and they both agreed to undergo counselling.
- [114] After this incident, it became difficult for the Mother to trust leaving I. with her inlaws again, in light of the alleged abuse she observed, nor was she confident she could trust the Father not to leave I. alone with them because of their close relationship. She testified that this incident caused her 'a lot of trauma and distrust in the family'.
- [115] The Mother described the agreement she reached with P.A. a few months later, that P.A. would not change I.'s diaper again. The Mother recalled the conversation with the Father and her in-laws at their home, but provided very little in her testimony about what she said to P.A. that troubled her about the diaper change on Thanksgiving or how this agreement with P.A. came about. What was clear from the Mother's testimony though is that she did not confront either P.A. or V.A. with her belief that they had abused or molested I. until the argument at L.A. and B.A.'s home on August 12, 2023.
- [116] The Mother also described an agreement that was facilitated by their marriage counsellor during a counselling session that I. would not be left alone with his grandparents without one of them being present.
- [117] According to the Father's testimony, he made this agreement with the Mother only because he wanted to spend more time with his parents with I. and saw this as a path to facilitating visits with them and I.
- [118] It was apparent from the Mother's cross-examination of the Father that she had expected that the Father told his grandmother about their agreement, since L.A. looked

after I. from time to time and thus believed that L.A. would have known that P.A. was not to visit when I. was in her home.

[119] In cross-examination, the Father confirmed that he did not inform his grandmother about their 'agreement', stating the reason he did not do so was because he did not 'feel the need' to 'drag' his grandmother into a 'huge family problem with my mother that my mother didn't know about'. He testified that he felt that the Mother could have easily told L.A. about their agreement if that was important to the Mother that L.A. know.

[120] Because the Mother was under the impression that the Father had told L.A. about their agreement regarding P.A., she assumed that L.A. was also aware of and understood her concerns for I.'s safety. In cross-examination, the Mother in effect confirmed that she had no specific evidence that P.A. was ever aware of any such agreement. Indeed, during cross-examination P.A. and L.A. each testified they were unaware of the Mother and Father's agreement that P.A. was not to be left alone with I.

[121] Also during cross-examination, the Mother confirmed that she had not reported her concerns about P.A. to MCFD or any other agency that could investigate, nor did she report her concern's to P.A.'s niece, given that P.A. babysat her niece's young son.

[122] The Mother had a different account of how the argument with her in laws on August 12 th  unfolded. She described her 'biggest fear' was that L.A. would permit P.A. and V.A. to visit her home while looking after I. The Mother's 'fear' indeed materialized that morning.

[123] In giving her account of the argument, the Mother confirmed that she was upset on seeing P.A. and V.A. when they arrived at L.A.'s home and told them they had to leave. She became more upset when neither P.A. nor V.A. would agree to leave. The Mother was not prepared to leave without I., even if that meant missing the counselling appointment that morning.

[124] The Mother lost her temper during the argument. That was clear from her testimony and the audio recording. She accused P.A. of having 'assaulted' and

'molested' I., and called the A. family 'insane'. She is heard on the recording saying that she witnessed P.A. abusing I. and is heard calling P.A. 'disgusting'.

- [125] In response to the audio recording of the argument, the Mother testified that she felt badgered by all of the A.'s during the argument, except the Father who was 'acting so calmly'. She did not expect that she would be subjected to verbal attack by the A.'s. She also described feeling in 'shock' that the 'entire' A. family were 'not on the same page' with her when it came to I.'s safety.
- [126] P.A. is heard on the recording telling the Mother to 'take a shot at her'. The Mother testified in her evidence in chief that she believed that P.A. was trying to set her up as someone who is 'mentally unstable' by baiting the Mother to assault her. She did not rise to the bait and did not rush toward P.A. or try to hit her.
- [127] The Mother added that she did not recall ever seeing the Father act so calmly in a heated situation and believed that the argument had been a set-up by the Father and his family, and that the Father's audio recording of the argument was part of the set-up.
- [128] The August 12 th  argument was last straw for the Mother, as she no longer felt comfortable, supported, or welcomed around the Father's extended family. From her standpoint, her marriage to the Father was at an end. She did not believe I. was safe around P.A. and V.A. and believed that neither the Father nor L.A. were prepared to stick-up for her and protect I.
- [129] After the parties got home after the argument, the Mother found a 'big slab of shatter' (a cannabis product) in plain view and this added to the Mother's concern that I. was not safe around the Father either. She then made the decision to leave the relationship taking I. with her to a women's transition home in the Fraser Valley a few days later.

## F) J.P.

[130] J.P. is the Mother's friend whom she met at the transition home. After they met, J.P. looked after I. for the Mother on a number of occasions, including one overnight visit after J.P. found an apartment.

[131] J.P. also accompanied the Mother early on during some of the parenting exchanges with the Father at the RCMP Detachment in Coquitlam. J.P. described the Father as polite on those occasions, although they did not speak extensively.

- [132] J.P. described I. as a likeable child, but noticed changes in I.'s behaviour after he came home from visits with this Father. She described I.'s behaviour following those visits as 'confrontational' and 'angry' at the Mother, that he would 'talk back' and tell the Mother he did not have to listen to her. He also called the Mother by her first name.

[133] J.P. then described a series of I.'s 'alarming behaviours' that she observed when she looked after him between January and June 2024. She described these behaviours variously as I.: pulling up her night gown and looking underneath, kissing 'inappropriately' (without elaborating), and trying to insert things 'into himself' and then touching his body parts, and saying the word 'grandma' when mentioning something inappropriate during toileting. She associated these behaviours to visits I. had with the Father, as they occurred after I. had parenting time with his dad.

- [134] J.P. did not provide a clear timeframe in her testimony as to when she had seen these behaviours. In cross-examination, J.P. confirmed that she had no specific training in childcare or early childhood development. J.P. also confirmed that she did not report these behaviours to anyone else apart from the Mother.

## VI. BURDEN OF PROOF, WITNESS CREDIBILITY, AND RELIABILITY

[135] The Mother's safety concerns for I. lie at the heart of her case for having primary care of I., having the final say in parental decision-making, and to require the Father to supervise I. at all times when the child is visiting his grandparents. These are key

factual issues that will inform my assessment of the parenting issues raised by the parties in this case.

- [136] The Mother has the burden of proving her safety concerns on a balance of probabilities. To meet this burden, there must be 'sufficiently clear, convincing, and cogent evidence' that the safety concerns the Mother alleges against the Father and his extended family are more likely to have occurred than not, in other words, that the balance is tipped in his or her favour: See F.H. v. McDougall, 2008 SCC 53, at paras. 44, 45, and 46. If the evidence is ambiguous, speculative, or evenly weighted between two plausible but irreconcilable version of events, then that standard has not been met.
- [137] There are differences in the recounting of the events in the testimony of the Mother and the Father and their supporting witnesses. To determine whether the safety concerns are proven, I will assess the credibility and reliability of the witness testimony and determine on a balance of probabilities what version is more plausible in the circumstances.
- [138] The task of assessing witness credibility is a difficult one and involves the assessment of the trustworthiness of a witness' testimony based upon the examination of various factors, including his or her '… [o]pportunities for knowledge, powers of observation, judgment and memory'. All of these factors '... combine to produce what is called credibility': Raymond v. Township of Bosanquet (1919), 59 SCR 452, at p. 460.
- [139] Credibility and reliability are two distinct legal concepts that are neatly summarized in R. v. Taylor , 2010 ONCJ 396, at 58:

"Credibility" is omnibus shorthand for a broad range of factors bearing on an assessment of the testimonial trustworthiness of witnesses. It has two generally distinct aspects or dimensions: honesty (sometimes, if confusingly, itself called "credibility") and reliability. The first, honesty, speaks to a witness' sincerity, candour and truthfulness in the witness box. The second, reliability, refers to a complex admixture of cognitive, psychological, developmental, cultural, temporal and environmental factors that impact on the accuracy of a witness' perception, memory and, ultimately, testimonial recitation. The evidence of even an honest witness may still be of dubious reliability.

[140] In this assessment, I have also applied the principles set out in Faryna v. Chorny , [1952] 2 D.L.R. 354, at p. 357 (B.C.C.A):

The credibility of interested witnesses, particularly in cases of conflict of evidence, cannot be gauged solely by the test of whether the personal demeanour of the particular witness carried conviction of the truth. The test must reasonably subject his story to an examination of its consistency with the probabilities that surround the currently existing conditions. In short, the real test of the truth of the story of a witness in such a case must be its harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions. Only thus can a Court satisfactorily appraise the testimony of quick-minded, experienced and confident witnesses, and of those shrewd persons adept in the half-lie and of long and successful experience in combining skilful exaggeration with partial suppression of the truth….

## VII. DISCUSSION

## ISSUE 1-3: THE MOTHER'S SAFETY CONCERNS

## (i) Safety Concerns About the Father

- [141] The Mother's safety concerns against the Father arise from her Reply and her Application for a Protection Order, where she alleges variously the Father's 'open drug use' when parenting I., family violence, 'lying about family members', and failing to supervise I. around his parents. Additionally, at trial, she relied on J.P.'s testimony to support her safety concerns in relation to I.'s 'alarming' sexualized behaviours after visits with the Father. These are broad and very serious allegations. The evidence in support of these allegations is derived from the Mother's testimony.
- [142] The Mother filed an application for a protection order against the Father that raised allegations of family violence, including, psychological abuse, physical violence, and an allegation that the Father had stolen $30,000.00 from her ICBC settlement.
- [143] The Mother netted approximately $60,000 from ICBC in settlement of her 2016 motor vehicle accident claim. She testified that the Father controlled and mismanaged her settlement funds and lost $30,000 in poor investment choices. In cross-examination,

the Mother maintained that the Father had 'stolen' her settlement money for these reasons. There no supporting documents, investment statements, or bank records to corroborate the Mother's assertions.

- [144] The Father, on the other hand, testified that the investment decisions made with the Mother's settlement funds were mutual ones, and that the balance of the Mother's settlement money was used to fund the parties' living expenses when the Father was out of work for a period of time during the COVID-19 pandemic.

[145] Given the Father's competing testimony, and without corroboration, the Mother has not proven this allegation with clear, cogent, and convincing evidence. Moreover, this issue is essentially an issue of property division, not family violence, that is outside this Court's jurisdiction that can be addressed in a divorce proceeding.

- [146] The Mother alleged one incident of a threat of physical violence in her crossexamination of the Father, where he had damaged a wall in their bedroom. The Father denied that he struck the wall in anger and explained that what had actually happened was that he had hit the wall in his sleep.
- [147] The Mother's application for a protection order never proceeded to hearing as the application was adjourned generally on the scheduled hearing date. The Mother did not provide a response to questioning in cross-examination for why she did not proceed with her application. I expect the most likely reason is because the Mother's stated safety concerns were already addressed by the protective terms contained in Judge Mengering's conduct order and Judge Malfair's FMC Order that the Father was following.

[148] The Father began having weekly parenting time with I. in late September 2023 in public, under the FMC Order. There were no reported incidents or safety concerns identified by the Mother in her testimony during I.'s parenting time or during parenting exchanges. Indeed, J.P. confirmed that the Father was polite during these exchanges.

- [149] The conduct order was also modified by a further order that permitted 'further conduct agreements' between the parties with respect to parenting because the visits were going well.
- [150] In fact, at the January 10, 2024 FSC, the Mother agreed to the removal of most of the protective conditions that were in place in the FMC Order, so that the Father could have overnight visits with I. The parties also agreed in the FSC Order to an equal sharing of parental responsibilities.
- [151] For these reasons, I have concluded that it was highly unlikely that a protection order would have been made in light of these circumstances had the Mother's application proceeded to hearing, as the Mother's stated concerns of family violence against the Father had resolved.
- [152] Another safety concern raised by the Mother in her pleadings and testimony was the allegation of the Father's open drug use. The Mother advised the Court in her opening statement that she expected that J.P. would testify about her observations of I. mimicking cannabis smoking behaviours, that the Mother attributed to the Father's drug use in the home. J.P. gave no evidence in her testimony of any such observations.
- [153] The Father admitted in his evidence in chief and in cross-examination to being a recreational cannabis user. The Father was cross-examined extensively by the Mother on his past and present cannabis usage, including assertions he actively sold cannabis out of their home. He further admitted to having sold cannabis to friends in their home on occasion before I. was born and that the Mother, too, was involved in this activity.
- [154] The only current evidence adduced by the Mother regarding the Father's cannabis usage in the home was the Mother's questioning of the Father in relation to his habit of keeping 'shatter' in in his top dresser drawer in his bedroom. The Father acknowledged that he used shatter, that he kept it in his dresser out of reach of I., and that he did not use it in I.'s presence.
- [155] I accept the Father's testimony that he is a recreational cannabis user and that he does not consume cannabis products in the presence of I. No further evidence was

led to establish that I. has been exposed to the Father's open drug use in the home, or that the Father's cannabis usage has harmed I. to any degree. The Mother's allegation of the Father's open drug use is speculative at best. This ground of safety concern thus fails.

[156] MCFD conducted an investigation of the Father following a child protection complaint made in the Fall of 2023. Following the investigation of this complaint, MCFD wrote to the Father on February 11, 2024 informing him there were 'no concerns' with respect to the Father's care of I.

- [157] This letter did not allay the Mother's safety concerns, as she became concerned about J.P.'s reports of I.'s sexualized behaviours after his visits with the Father. In response to J.P.'s concerns, the Mother took I. to the emergency room for assessment for sexual abuse and then had I. assessed by the Healing Clinic on April 9, 2024. She did not inform the Father about J.P.'s concerns, nor did she disclose to the Father the emergency room visit, or the referral to the Healing Clinic. The Mother did not call the treating physicians who examined I. in connection with these concerns, nor did she produce the medical assessments in relation to these investigations.
- [158] At the conclusion of the Mother's case, I allowed the Father's application to be recalled to testify in response to J.P.'s testimony with regard to I.'s 'alarming behaviours', as no advance notice of this witness was provided prior to trial. The Father, in responding to J.P.'s testimony, described I. as a curious child. He attributed some of the alarming behaviours that J.P. described in her testimony as part of I.'s natural curiosity with his own body parts and the body parts of other adults. I accept the Father's evidence as providing a credible explanation for these behaviours.
- [159] I find that the Mother's continued safety concerns regarding the Father's care of I. are predicated on speculation.
- [160] In sum, the Mother has not proven on a balance of probabilities her safety concerns for I. in his Father's care.

## (ii) Safety Concerns About I.'s Paternal Grandparents

[161] The October 2021 diaper-changing incident was the event that caused the Mother to believe that I. was sexually molested by his paternal grandparents. This belief has informed the Mother's positions on parenting time throughout these proceedings, including the Mother's continued safety concerns for I. in the presence of his grandparents, and her belief that P.A. breached their informal agreement when she changed I. into his swimsuit.

[162] In her testimony, the Mother stated that she was in the kitchen while P.A. changed I.'s diaper on a changing pad in the living room. The Mother did not see the diaper change unfold. She was unaware that I. had a diaper rash and that P.A. applied an excess of Penaten to I.'s diaper area.

[163] She then testified that she overheard 'noise' in the living room, and went to investigate. As she stood outside the kitchen and peered into the living room. She described seeing her son in an exposed position with his legs held upright by his grandfather and his grandmother wiping I.'s 'private area', and massaging diaper cream on his genitals. She described being upset and in shock in what she saw her in-laws doing to her son.

[164] She testified that she told her in-laws to put a stop to what they were doing, but neither P.A., V.A., nor the Father testified that they heard the Mother say words to that effect. There was nothing remarkable about the Mother's demeanour that signalled to the Father, P.A., or V.A. that she was upset in any way by what she saw. In fact, P.A., V.A., and the Father carried on with the evening until the Mother asked to leave, and the parties went home with I.

[165] P.A. and V.A. each gave a completely different account of I.'s diaper change in their testimony than that of the Mother. Their evidence involved the application and removal of an excess amount of diaper cream that P.A. had applied to I.'s diaper area.

[166] At the time of I.'s diaper-change, there were other guests in the living room, including the Father. The Father was close-by and he saw his parents struggling with

I.'s diaper change. He described I.'s diaper change in a manner that was consistent with the account given by both P.A. and V.A.

[167] P.A. and V.A. gave a clear, credible, and plausible account of I.'s diaper change that I accept. I thus find that P.A. applied too much of a thick diaper cream on I.'s bottom and that P.A. needed V.A.'s help to hold-up their grandson's legs so she could remove the excess cream. The Mother was in the kitchen and did not see what had happened with the diaper cream, until she saw her son exposed and his grandmother in the act of wiping off the cream.

[168] I do not accept the Mother's evidence as providing an accurate or reliable account of what happened to I. during the diaper change. The reasons I reject the Mother's evidence are twofold: First, she did not see the entirety of the diaper change and had she done so, she would have understood that this was a messy diaper change and that P.A. was trying to remove an excess of diaper cream from I.'s bottom. Second, the Mother's account of what she saw is simply implausible as I.'s diaper change took place in plain view in the living room in the presence of the Father and other guests.

[169] Unfortunately, the Mother jumped to the wrong conclusion that P.A. and V.A. molested her son. She unreasonably held on to this conclusion as the basis for her continued safety concerns for I. around his grandparents, the long periods of estrangement that ensued with her in-laws, and her insistence that P.A. and V.A. be supervised during visits with I.

[170] In sum, the Mother has not proven her allegations of sexual or physical abuse against P.A. and V.A. on a balance of probabilities. Given the seriousness of these allegations, I find as a fact that P.A. and V.A. did not in any way whatsoever molest or abuse I. during the diaper change at the family Thanksgiving gathering in their home in October 2021. Accordingly, I find that the Mother's continued fear for I.'s safety around his grandparents is unreasonably held.

[171] With regard to the swimsuit-changing incident in May 2022, P.A. changed I. into his swimsuit quickly out of convenience as the child wanted to go into the pool, the

Father was occupied building a deck, and L.A. was in the general vicinity. I find as a fact that P.A. did nothing untoward or improper in changing I. into his swimsuit in these circumstances. There was no breach by P.A. of her promise to the Mother not to change I.'s diaper. The Mother's upset on this occasion was again the result of her unreasonable belief that I. was unsafe around his grandmother.

[172] It is for these reasons I made the order after closing submissions, vacating the supervision condition found in Term 7 of the FMC order.

## (iii) Safety Concerns Involving I.'s Great-Grandparents

[173] The Mother's safety concern for I. regarding his great-grandparents flows from her belief that L.A. is unable to manage the care of both her husband, B.A., and I., given B.A.'s dementia and L.A.'s advanced age.

[174] L.A. testified that she is in excellent health and is capable of looking after both I. and B.A. Both L.A. and V.A. confirmed in their testimony that B.A. is independent in his activities of daily living, that his condition stabilized with a change in medication, and thus presents no safety concerns for I. in the home.

[175] The Mother did not have any issues prior to the parties' separation in having L.A. look after I. She did not identify or point to any recent or specific safety concerns or issues that had occurred while L.A. looked after I. following the parties' separation.

[176] I accept L.A. and V.A.'s testimony as credible in contrast to the testimony of the Mother whose evidence was grounded in speculation. Accordingly, I have concluded that the Mother has not proven on a balance of probabilities the presence of safety risks for I. in his great-grandparents' home.

## ISSUE 4: DID THE FATHER BREACH THE MOTHER'S RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL?

[177] The right of first refusal was an important term for the Mother in the FSC Order, as she did not want third parties (except an agreed upon daycare provider) or extended family members (including I.'s great-grandmother) looking after I. The Mother contends

that the Father breached this term by having his great grandmother care for I., when he was unable to do so during his parenting time, without first offering the time to her.

- [178] This was not disputed by the Father. While the supervisory condition (Term 7) remained in effect, the Father could not leave I. on his own with his parents even for brief periods, which meant that he could not rely on them to help him out with childcare. Thus, he relied on L.A. to help look after I. during his parenting time that included an overnight visit on one occasion, when he was called in to work early the next day. L.A. was a practical and obvious childcare choice for the Father to utilize in these circumstances, particularly since she had looked after I. on her own before the parties' separation.
- [179] I am not persuaded on this evidence that the Father breached the FSC Order by not offering the parenting time to the Mother in these circumstances, especially given that the Mother had no difficulty herself relying on her friend and third-party, J.P., to babysit I., including an overnight visit. The Mother's June 6, 2024 enforcement application is thus dismissed.

## ISSUE 5: PARENTING TIME AND PARENTING RESPONSIBILITIES

- [180] The Father seeks equal parenting time on a week on week off rotation and shared responsibilities with respect to I.'s care and decision-making (with the Father having final authority on decision-making), submitting that this is in I.'s best interests.
- [181] The Father submits that he has been fully engaged and extensively involved in I.'s care since birth and is fully capable of looking after I. under a shared parenting arrangement. He further submits that it is only the Mother's desire to move to [redacted for publication], given the travel time and distance, that would make a week on week off schedule unworkable.
- [182] The Mother opposes equal parenting time recognizing that this is unworkable with her proposed move to [redacted for publication], which is about a six-hour drive from Coquitlam. She submits that she has been I.'s primary care giver since birth, that she has continued to be I.'s primary care parent since separation, and that it is in I.'s

best interests that I. continue to have primary residency with her. She proposes that the Father have parenting time one week per month, two-consecutive weeks of parenting time during the summer, and further parenting time as agreed. She further proposes that the parenting exchanges take place in Merritt, which is the mid-point in terms of driving time between Coquitlam and [redacted for publication].

- [183] The Mother agrees to share parenting responsibilities with the Father, provided she has the final say in the event of a dispute, subject to the Father having a right of further review of that decision.
- [184] Section 37 of the FLA imposes the obligation on the Court to consider the best interests of the child only when making any orders under Part 4 of the FLA , including an order pertaining to the care of and time with children. This is known as the 'best interests' principle. This principle applies to all existing child custody questions, including guardianship, allocation of parenting time and parental responsibilities, contact with the child, and relocation of a child.
- [185] This principle is reflected throughout my analysis of all of the parenting issues in this case having regard to 'all of I.'s needs and circumstances'. Simply stated, the best interests principle means that the parties must put I.'s 'best interests' ahead of their own when discharging their parental responsibilities. This principle is mandated by section 43 of the FLA which provides:
4. 43(1) A child's guardian must exercise his or her parental responsibilities in the best interests of the child.
- [186] There is no presumption under the FLA that parents are entitled to the sharing of equal parenting responsibilities or equal parenting time with their children. The reason is because the child's best interest remains the sole consideration to be assessed by the Court. In this regard, ss. 40(4) of the FLA expressly states:
- (4) In the making of parenting arrangements, no particular arrangement is presumed to be in the best interests of the child and without limiting that, the following must not be presumed:

- (a) that parental responsibilities should be allocated equally among guardians;
- (b) that parenting time should be shared equally among guardians;
- (c) that decisions among guardians should be made separately or together.

[187] In determining the child's best interests, the Court must consider 'all of the child's needs and circumstances': s. 37(2). Subsection (2) specifically mentions the factors to be considered (and it is clear on a reading of this section that these factors are not intended to be exhaustive):

- (a) the child's health and emotional well-being;
- (b) the child's views, unless it would be inappropriate to consider them;
- (c) the nature and strength of the relationships between the child and significant persons in the child's life;
- (d) the history of the child's care;
- (e) the child's need for stability, given the child's age and stage of development;
- (f) the ability of each person who is a guardian or seeks guardianship of the child, or who has or seeks parental responsibilities, parenting time or contact with the child, to exercise his or her responsibilities;
- (g) the impact of any family violence on the child's safety, security or wellbeing, whether the family violence is directed toward the child or another family member;
- (h) whether the actions of a person responsible for family violence indicate that the person may be impaired in his or her ability to care for the child and meet the child's needs;
- (i) the appropriateness of an arrangement that would require the child's guardians to cooperate on issues affecting the child, including whether requiring cooperation would increase any risks to the safety, security or well-being of the child or other family members;
- (j) any civil or criminal proceeding relevant to the child's safety, security or well-being.

[188] Subsection 37(3) further provides that an order 'is not in the best interests of a child unless it protects, to the greatest extent possible, the child's physical, psychological and emotional safety, security and well-being.' Under subsection (4), the

Court may consider a person's conduct only if it substantially affects a factor set out in subsection (2), and only to the extent that it affects that factor.

[189] I will now apply these factors to the Father's application for shared parenting and shared parental responsibilities:

## (a) I.'s Health and Emotional Well-Being

- [190] I. is [redacted for publication] years old. He will start kindergarten in [redacted for publication]. I. is described as a healthy, happy, loving, well-behaved, and curious child.
- [191] The testimony of both parties confirms that they are each caring and devoted parents.
- [192] MCFD in their investigation of the Father concluded specifically in their letter to the Father following their child protection investigation that 'it is clear that being a parent to your son is your primary focus.'
- [193] The Mother made a serious and unsubstantiated allegation of child sexual abuse against I.'s paternal grandmother following a diaper change in October 2021, that led to I.'s long periods of estrangement from his paternal grandparents that occurred throughout much of I.'s young life.
- [194] The Mother fled with I. from the family home in mid-August 2023 and moved into a transition home, with her whereabouts unknown to the Father. When his parenting time resumed in late-September, the Father's visits with I. were restricted by court order to short visits in a public setting, owing to the Mother's stated safety concerns about the Father, which concerns I have found were unsubstantiated.
- [195] The Father did not have overnight parenting time with I. until January 2024 when the FSC Order was implemented.
- [196] Further, the Mother was found by Judge McQuillan to have wrongfully withheld parenting time to the Father, due to her unfounded safety concerns for I. regarding the

Father and his extended family, which led to a further disruption for I. in his time with the Father.

[197] While the long-term impacts of these period disruptions on I.'s emotional development and relationship with his Father and extended family are unknown given I.'s young age, I do find that these disruptions were extensive and cannot be ignored.

## (b) I.'s Views

- [198] Given I.'s young age, it would be inappropriate to consider his views.

## (c) Relationships Between I. and Significant Persons in I.'s Life

- [199] I accept the testimony of both parties that I. has a close bond with each of his parents. I also accept the testimony of the Father, as corroborated by the testimony of his parents and great-grandmother L.A., that the A. family is close knit, that they like spending time together as a family, and that they enjoy weekly family and special occasion dinners, and outings.

[200] I. has close ties to his Father's family that extends to his grandparents, greatgrandparents, Uncle L., second cousin M., and M.'s young son L. who is close in age to I.

[201] The Mother presented little evidence about the nature and strength of I.'s relationship with her extended family and her friends, except that she made a passing reference to having close friends in [redacted for publication], at least one of whom has children I.'s age, and her boyfriend R., whom I. is just getting to know.

## (d) The History of I.'s Care

[202] The Father testified that until the separation, the parties shared childcare responsibilities for I. while they were together because they worked opposite schedules. The Father started work early in the morning, leaving him the afternoon and evenings to care for I., while the Mother worked for a cannabis dispensary. The Mother did not

challenge the Father's evidence in this regard, nor did she present a different account of how they divided-up responsibilities in the household.

[203] After separation, it is undisputed that the Mother has been primarily responsible for I.'s care. This was not through the Father's choice.

[204] Once the FSC Order was in place, the Father began to take on a significant role in I.'s care that also included additional weeks of parenting time while the Mother was travelling to and from [redacted for publication] to visit friends.

## (e) I.'s Need for Stability

[205] Given I.'s young age and stage of development, his need for stability is high.

[206] The Father has lived in Coquitlam since childhood where he has friends and family close-by, and ties to his church. He lives in a two-bedroom rental apartment in close proximity to his parents' home. This is the home he shared with the Mother until their separation. I. has the second bedroom, which the Father has fixed up for him.

[207] The Father has full-time stable employment with a good salary as a [redacted for publication] for a large commercial bakery in Vancouver. His job has early morning starts and he finishes his day in the early afternoon. He testified that with the help of his family, shared parenting would be workable for him on a week on week off rotation. He would require part-time day care three days a week (given his days off) with help from his mother looking after I. in the morning, due to his early morning work starts.

[208] The Father has no concerns about the safety of I. in the care of his parents or his grandmother. P.A. and L.A. also confirmed in their testimony that they were able and willing to help the Father out with childcare, with P.A. assisting with I.'s early morning care and taking him to daycare.

[209] Following separation, the Mother resided with I. in a group transition home in the Fraser Valley until some point in 2024 (although this was not clear from her evidence). Presently, she and I. are staying with her Mother who owns a house in Surrey, where they each have their own bedroom.

[210] The Mother is currently unemployed. The Mother is pregnant and her baby is due in March. Her relationship with R. (the baby's father) is still relatively new. She rented an apartment in [redacted for publication] and plans to find employment in that community after her baby is born. She has close friends with young children who will be her support network, but provided few details about them. She does not have plans at present to live with R. in [redacted for publication]. Few other details were provided by the Mother in evidence about her plan.

[211] The evidence favours the Father on this issue; he is financially able to provide for I., has stable housing, and family supports close by. The Mother's plan involves moving I. to a community far away from the Father and his family. The Mother has close friends but no family supports in [redacted for publication]. Her relationship with R. is relatively new and far from certain. Her employment prospects are unclear. The Mother's current life circumstances do not promote the level of stability that is required for a young child.

## (f)  Ability of Each Parent to Exercise their Responsibilities

- [212] Apart from the Mother's attitudes towards her in-laws and her withholding of parenting time, the parties have generally been able to manage I.'s day-to-day care and share parenting responsibilities under the FSC Order.
- [213] It is undisputed that the Mother offered the Father additional parenting time, which he accepted, for at least two extended periods while she was in [redacted for publication].
- [214] The Mother should have disclosed J.P.'s reports of I.'s sexualized behaviours to the Father before taking action on her own to have the child assessed. The Father had a right to be informed and the failure to apprise the Father of her concerns was a decision that was not in I.'s interests.
- [215] This factor weighs in favour of the parties having shared parenting responsibilities under s. 41 of the FLA with the Father having final decision-making authority and the Mother having a right or review under s. 49.

## (g, h, i, j) The Impact of Family Violence and Any Civil or Criminal Proceedings on I.'s Safety, Security, or Well-Being

[216] In light of my findings with respect to the Mother's safety concerns, family violence is not an issue of concern for either party that would impact I.'s safety, security and well-being.

[217] There are no criminal or civil proceedings that would impact I.'s safety, security, and wellbeing.

## (k) Conclusion on the Issue of Parenting Time and Parenting Responsibilities

[218] In light of the foregoing and subject to my conclusions on the Mother's relocation application, the Father has met his burden that shared parenting time on a week on week off rotation is a workable parenting arrangement that will provide emotional stability, security, and will enhance I.'s emotional and developmental wellbeing.

[219] I have further concluded that the parties should share all parental responsibilities under s. 41 of the FLA . Given the Mother's unreasonable views with respect to I.'s safety, the Father will have the final decision-making authority on parental responsibilities, subject to the Mother's right of review under s. 49.

## ISSUE 6: RELOCATION

[220] The Mother did not bring a formal application to relocate to [redacted for publication]. I have treated her Reply to the Father's application prohibiting relocation (which was adjourned generally), as the Mother's relocation application.

[221] The Mother seeks to have the majority of parenting time and primary residency of I. She further seeks to cancel the Judge McQuillan's non-removal order to facilitate her planned move to [redacted for publication].

[222] The Father contends that until the separation, both parties shared responsibility for I.'s care, and that the current status quo was the result of the Mother's unilateral decision-making, following her decision to leave the marriage and flee the home. As he

seeks shared parenting time, he opposes the Mother's application for relocation, and thus seeks to keep Judge McQuillan's non-removal order in place.

[223] As there is an existing 'order respecting parenting arrangements', namely, the FSC Order, s. 46 of the FLA does not apply in this case. This means the Mother's relocation application is governed by Division 6, Part 4 of the FLA .

[224] The FLA does not distinguish between final orders and interim orders when addressing the applicability of this Division to relocation applications.

[225] Section 65 of the FLA defines a 'relocation' as 'a change in the location of the residence of a child or child's guardian that can reasonably be expected to have a significant impact on the child's relationship with (a) a guardian, or (b) one or more other persons having a significant role in the child's life.'

[226] Section 66(1) requires that a child's guardian who plans to relocate themselves or a child, must notice give 'to all other guardians and persons having contact with the child' at least 60 days of the date of the relocation and name of the proposed location.

[227] Under s. 66(2), the Court may grant an exemption to a guardian from the notice requirement if the Court is satisfied that:

- (a) notice cannot be given without incurring a risk of family violence by another guardian or a person having contact with the child, or
- (b) there is no ongoing relationship between the child and the other guardian or the person having contact with the child.

[228] Section 69 governs relocation applications, and sets out the following requirements that must be met by the Mother as the 'relocating parent' and provides:

- 69(1) In this section, 'relocating guardian' means a guardian who plans to relocate a child.
- (2) On application by a guardian, a court may make an order permitting or prohibiting the relocation of a child by the relocating guardian.
- (3) Despite section 37 (1) [best interests of child] , the court, in making an order under this section, must consider, in addition to the factors set out in section 37(2), the factors set out in subsection (4)(a) of this section.

- (4) If an application is made under this section and the relocating guardian and another guardian do not have substantially equal parenting time with the child,
2. (a)  the relocating guardian must satisfy the court that
3. (i) the proposed relocation is made in good faith, and
4. (ii)  the relocating guardian has proposed reasonable and workable arrangements to preserve the relationship between the child and the child's other guardians, persons who are entitled to contact with the child, and other persons who have a significant role in the child's life, and
5. (b) on the court being satisfied of the factors referred to in paragraph (a), the relocation must be considered to be in the best interests of the child unless another guardian satisfies the court otherwise.
- (5) If an application is made under this section and the relocating guardian and another guardian have substantially equal parenting time with the child, the relocating guardian must satisfy the court
7. (a) of the factors described in subsection (4)(a), and
8. (b) that the relocation is in the best interests of the child.
- (6) For the purposes of determining if the proposed relocation is made in good faith, the court must consider all relevant factors, including the following:
10. (a) the reasons for the proposed relocation;
11. (b) whether the proposed relocation is likely to enhance the general quality of life of the child and, if applicable, of the relocating guardian, including increasing emotional well-being or financial or educational opportunities;
12. (c) whether notice was given under section 66 [notice of relocation] ;
13. (d) any restrictions on relocation contained in a written agreement or an order.
- (7) In determining whether to make an order under this section, the court must not consider whether a guardian would still relocate if the child's relocation were not permitted.
- [229] The test for relocation falls under s. 69(4) where there is an unequal parenting arrangement between the parties (as in the present case) and s. 69(5) applies where there is an equal parenting arrangement between the parties.
- [230] Under subsection (4), there is a rebuttable presumption in favour of relocation ( i.e., that relocation is in the child's best interests) that applies once the relocating

parent meets the requirements of good faith and providing reasonable and workable parenting arrangements to facilitate the child's relationship with the non-relocating parent and their family. This means that the onus of proof falls on the non-relocating parent to establish that relocation is not in the child's best interests.

[231] The approach to be followed in applying these tests is summarized by Fleming J. (as she then was) in C.M.B. v. B.G.D., 2014 BCSC 780, at para. 78:

[78] To summarize, I have concluded that the correct approach under s. 69(4) and (5) is for the court to consider whether the proposed relocation is made in good faith and whether reasonable and workable arrangements have been proposed. If one or both of these criteria are not met, the court must still go on to consider whether the proposed relocation is in the child's best interests. Satisfaction of good faith and reasonable workable arrangements is necessary in order for a relocating guardian to benefit from the presumption under s. 69(4)(b) that the move is in the best interests of the child.

[232] Irrespective of which presumption and onus of proof applies, the Court must keep its 'proper focus' on the best interests of the child. In Duggan v. White , 2019 BCCA 200, Saunders J.A., writing for the Court explains why:

[17] It is amply clear that a court must consider the reasons for the move: s. 46(2)(a). Moreover, as aptly described in Stav and reiterated in K.W. , the standard is the best interests of the child. I do not consider that the lens of 'necessity' is the right one. There is nothing in the Act that requires a judge to put the reasons proffered through the strainer of necessity, and doing so can divert the judge from the proper focus on the child. Full consideration of the reasons, on the other hand, should meet at least the standards of reasonableness and good faith. The absence of either of those qualities may indicate a carelessness of the child's interests in maintaining and establishing relationships beyond those with the relocating parent, and call into question the benefits to the child invariably said to be available by the relocation. In contrast, the absence of necessity does not negate the wisdom of a plan.

[233] In the circumstances of this case, I accept that there has been a substantially unequal parenting schedule following the parties' separation and the interim parenting orders, including the FSC Order, that were made after these proceedings were commenced. This means that the Mother will benefit from the presumption and onus of

proof in ss. 69(4). Under this test, I must assess whether the Mother's relocation plan was made in good faith, that the arrangements proposed preserve I.'s relationship with the Father and his family, and that it is in the best interests of I.

## (a) Was the Mother's Relocation Proposal made in Good Faith

[234] The good faith requirement under s. 69(4)(a)(i) involves an assessment of 'all the relevant factors' listed in s. 69(6), including: (a) the Mother's reasons for the move; (b) whether the move would enhance I.'s life; (c) whether notice of relocation was given; and (d) any restrictions on relocation.

[235] A lack of 'good faith' in the context of s. 69(4) and (6) does not imply 'malice or ill intent' on the part of the relocating parent: T.S. v. J.R.S. , 2024 BCPC 2, at para 98. Rather, the Court must assess the reasonableness of the whole of the relocation plan to determine whether it was made in good faith.

## (i) Reasons for the Move

[236] The Father opposes the Mother's proposed move to [redacted for publication] as being driven by her own self-interest.

[237] The Mother's main reasons for moving to [redacted for publication] are variously to have a fresh start in life, to live near close friends and her new partner (the baby's father), to find long term employment in the horticulture field, and to live in a more affordable community.

[238] The Mother acknowledges that her relationship with R. is still relatively new. She does not have plans to cohabit with R. at present and has instead has rented her own accommodation for herself, I. and her new baby after the child is born.

[239] The Mother has close friends with children near in age to I., who are like family to the Mother. She testified that she has reasonable prospects for full-time employment in the horticulture field, but did not elaborate on specific job prospects or produce further evidence to support this position, apart from a short term position she had with the [redacted for publication] that ended on August 31, 2024 and was not renewed.

[240] The Mother is confident that her plan for shared parenting is workable with the parties meeting mid-point in Merritt for parenting exchanges. She mentioned home schooling as an option for I., so as to facilitate the Father's proposed parenting time of one week per month.

## (ii) Will the Proposed Relocation Enhance the General Quality of I.'s Life?

[241] For the reasons above, the Mother argues the move would enhance I.'s quality of life. However, the Mother's current life circumstances, employment prospects, and relationship with R. are far from certain with the relocation plan that has been proposed. While the Mother herself may have close friends, she has no family supports in [redacted for publication], and I. will be separated from his Father and his extended family.

## (iii)  Was Notice of the Move Given to the Father?

[242] The Mother did not provide written notice to the Father in accordance with s. 66(1) regarding her plans to relocate with I. to [redacted for publication], nor did she apply for an exemption under subsection (2). The only specific notice she provided of her proposed plan to relocate to [redacted for publication] with the filing of her Reply in opposition to the Father's non-removal application.

## (iv)  Any Restrictions on Relocation?

[243] As stated earlier in these reasons, Judge McQuillan's August 18, 2024 interim order prohibits either party from removing I. from the Lower Mainland without the consent of the other parent or order of the Court. The Mother seeks to set this order aside to permit relocation.

## (v) Any Other Relevant Factors?

[244] I am unaware of any other relevant factors raised by the parties.

## (vi)  Conclusion on Good Faith

[245] Taking all of the factors set out in s. 69(6) into account, I find that the Mother's relocation move was not made in good faith. I make this finding for the following reasons:

[246] First, the Mother's unilateral actions following separation led to the unequal division of parenting time between the parties.

[247] Second, the Mother's relationship with R. is in the early stages and their commitment level is uncertain. I. does not have an established bond with R., as evidenced by the fact that he was only being gradually introduced to R. at the time of closing submissions.

[248] Third, the Mother did not discuss in evidence her efforts to find accommodation in the Lower Mainland. She did not disclose her rent costs in [redacted for publication] and did not produce a copy of her rental agreement for the apartment she rented.

[249] I am prepared to take judicial notice that the cost of rents in the Lower Mainland in larger centres closer to Vancouver, such as Coquitlam, are typically higher than rents in other communities. However, absent clear, convincing, and cogent evidence, I am not willing to take judicial notice that rents are significantly less in [redacted for publication] than rents in agricultural communities outside of Vancouver such as the greater Chilliwack and Abbotsford areas, or even Langley, where the Mother could be expected to find employment in the horticulture field.

[250] Fourth, the Mother provided general descriptions only of her efforts to find employment in the Lower Mainland and provided no documentary evidence to support those efforts since separation. The Mother did not produce any evidence of current or prospective job opportunities in horticulture in [redacted for publication], apart from her temporary position with the [redacted for publication], or her anticipated salary ranges for these positions.

[251] Fifth, the benefits of home schooling for I. were not developed by the Mother in evidence, other than in making a passing reference to home schooling as a way to facilitate her parenting plan. I cannot conclude whether and to what degree home schooling is a good option for I. without input from the Father, and to what extent this would enhance I.'s overall education and quality of life.

[252] Finally, I have further concluded from the evidence that the Mother's decisionmaking in wanting this move was likely influenced by the breakdown of her relationship with the A. family, her safety concerns involving the Father's care of I., and her ongoing fears of I.'s paternal grandmother, which have not been borne out in the evidence.

[253] For these reasons, I find the Mother has not made reasonable efforts to remain in the Lower Mainland and to prioritize I.'s relationship with his Father and his extended family. Accordingly, the proposed move to [redacted for publication] has not been made in good faith.

## (b) Has the Mother Proposed Reasonable and Workable Arrangements to Preserve I.'s Relationship with the Father and his Extended Family?

[254] The Mother's relocation plan increases the Father's parenting time to one week each month from the current FSC order of alternating weekends, and offers as well, an additional two weeks during the summer.

[255] The move to [redacted for publication] would make equal parenting unworkable and would require a young child to travel long distances involving a minimum of 12 hours of driving time round trip for each parenting visit.

[256] In my opinion, this plan is not a workable and reasonable arrangement that would adequately preserve I.'s relationship with his Father and his extended family, as the move would limit I.'s opportunities to see them.

## (c) I.'s Best Interests

[257] As the Mother has not met either criteria in s. 69(4)(a)(i) and (b), there is no presumption that the proposed relocation is in I.'s best interests. This means the Mother has the burden to show that the relocation is in I.'s best interests.

[258] I have addressed the s. 37(2) factors in connection with the Father's application for equal parenting time [see paras. 189-219]. The Mother's relocation plan does not alter my conclusion on parenting arrangements. My opinion remains that equal parenting time on a week on week off rotation is in I.'s best interests. This arrangement will promote I.'s relationship with both parents and their families and will ensure that I. has the stability, security, and the nurturing needed to enhance his development and emotional wellbeing.

[259] The Mother's relocation application is therefore dismissed.

## ISSUE 7: COMPENSATORY AND HOLIDAY PARENTING TIME

[260] The Father seeks 10 days compensatory parenting time in light of Judge McQuillan's finding on his enforcement order. I decline to award compensatory parenting time to the Father, as I accept the Mother's evidence that she offered additional parenting time to the Father that approximated those missed days when she travelled to and from [redacted for publication]. The Father confirmed in his testimony that he had at least two seven-day blocks of parenting time with I. that were offered by the Mother in 2024.

[261] The parties will share equally holidays including Winter Break, Christmas, Easter, and Spring Break (once I. commences school), on an alternating schedule.

[262] This year, the Father will have his choice of parenting time with I. from 10:00 am on December 23 rd  through Christmas Day at 3:00 pm, or on Christmas Day from 3:00 pm until 5:00 pm on December 27 th . The reason the Father will have first choice is because the Mother has had the majority of parenting time since separation and

because I. missed out on spending Christmas with his grandparents in 2022. Except for these dates, the regular parenting schedule will continue.

[263] The parties will each have a minimum of 14 consecutive days of vacation time with I. during the summer. Each party will provide at least 90 days written notice to the other party of their preferred vacation dates.

## ISSUE 8: CHILD SUPPORT

[264] The Father was between jobs for part of 2021 during the COVID-pandemic and reported annual earnings of $26,936.48. In 2022, he earned $60,543 with his current employer. In 2023, his salary increased to $72,440 and he expects to earn $73,561 in 2024.

[265] The Father has consistently paid monthly child support to the Mother since the parties' separation. He agrees his monthly child support will increase to $702 with his modest pay increase.

[266] He seeks an adjustment or an offset in his support payments by the Guideline amount that ought to be imputed to the Mother. I will address this submission in the next section.

## ISSUE 9: SPOUSAL SUPPORT

[267] The Mother seeks spousal support following the breakdown of the marriage. The Father opposes the Mother's claim for spousal support, contending that she has transferrable and marketable job skills and is capable of working full time. He also submits that the Mother failed to provide evidence of her job search efforts, or in the alternative, he submits that spousal support should be of limited duration.

[268] The case of Bilan v. Bilan , 2015 BCSC 21, at paras. 163-171 provides a succinct summary of the legal principles that govern entitlement to spousal support under the FLA and the Federal Spousal Support Guidelines that I reproduce below:

[163] There are three dimensions of spousal support: (1) entitlement; (2) duration, and (3) amount. Entitlement under the Family Law Act is determined with reference to four objectives set out in s. 161 of the Family Law Act as follows:

- (a) to recognize any economic advantages or disadvantages to the spouses arising from the relationship between the spouses or the breakdown of that relationship;
- (b) to apportion between the spouses any financial consequences arising from the care of their child, beyond the duty to provide support for the child;
- (c) to relieve any economic hardship of the spouses arising from the breakdown of the relationship between the spouses;
- (d) as far as practicable, to promote the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse within a reasonable period of time.

[164] The objectives set out in the Family Law Act are the same as in the Divorce Act and hence the case law under the latter can and does inform the former.

[165] There are three bases for entitlement to spousal support: compensatory, non -compensatory, and contractual support: Moge v. Moge , 1992 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 813 (compensatory support); Bracklow v. Bracklow , 1999 CanLII 715 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 420 (non-compensatory support); and Miglin v. Miglin , 2003 SCC 24 (contractual support).

[166] Compensatory principles address the contributions of a spouse to the relationship and the spouse's losses upon its breakdown. The classic application, although by no means the only one, arises in relationships, such as the case in hand, where one spouse did not pursue employment outside the home in order to care for the children. The end of that relationship places the spouse at an economic disadvantage, which compensatory support should address ('foregone careers and missed opportunities': Bracklow ).

[167] Non-compensatory principles address the needs of a spouse after the breakdown of the relationship. This kind of support arises out of the relationship itself and is based on the social obligation of a spouse to look after a former partner who is in difficulty, rather than letting that burden fall upon the public.

[168] No one principle or set of objectives dominates the analysis. A court should balance the various relevant factors and strike the balance that best achieves justice in the particular case. This is a highly fact-specific exercise.

[169] No single statutory objective is paramount, so both the compensatory and non-compensatory grounds can be used to justify entitlement. Generally speaking, any significant disparity in incomes at the end of a marriage or relationship will usually give rise to an entitlement to some spousal support for some period of time.

[170] The leading case law referred to above addressed entitlement and not the more mundane difficult issues of amount and duration with which the trial courts are called upon to struggle.

[171] Under the Family Law Act , if entitlement to spousal support is established having regard to the objectives set forth above, then s. 160 of the Act makes it mandatory for the other spouse to provide support. The amount and duration of that support is determined on a consideration of the conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse including the three circumstances specifically identified in s. 162 of the Act . In practice, however, the federal Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines released by the federal Department of Justice are usually applied. While these Guidelines are only 'advisory' in nature, British Columbia is one of the provinces which has strongly endorsed their use: Yemchuk v. Yemchuk , 2005 BCCA 406, Chutter v. Chutter , 2008 BCCA 507.

[269] I will now apply these principles to the present case.

[270] The Mother has training in landscaping, botany and horticulture, and had, for a time, worked in those fields. During the marriage, the Mother worked for a shop that sold honey and at least two cannabis retailers. She had taken training as a traffic flagger (paid for by the Father), but chose not to work in this field as she felt her eyesight was too poor for the job.

[271] The Mother seeks compensatory spousal support predicated on the homemaking and childcare role she assumed in the marriage, asserting that her pursuit of her career in horticulture was delayed in light of these responsibilities in the marriage. I have difficulty accepting this submission as the Mother worked prior to and following I.'s birth and provided little if any evidence indicating that the Father was unsupportive of her

career aspirations, or that she declined job opportunities in horticulture or botany in light of her family responsibilities.

[272] I also accept the Father's evidence that both parties worked following I.'s birth and shared child-rearing duties based on their respective work schedules. The Mother did not suggest otherwise in her evidence.

[273] I have concluded that the relationship of the parties was not akin to a traditional marriage, where the Mother stayed at home to care for I. and sacrificed career opportunities for the sake of the parties' marriage. Indeed, the employment the Mother has had since I.'s birth is consistent with the employment that she had prior to I.'s birth, her evidence being that she was working in retail position at the time of her pregnancy and had done so prior to the pregnancy as well. What most likely delayed the Mother's pursuit of her career aspirations in horticulture was her 2016 motor vehicle accident and the long period of convalescence she needed to recover from her whiplash injuries. Thus, the Mother has not established compensatory entitlement to spousal support on the evidence.

[274] There was no evidence at trial that would indicate the Mother has a contractual entitlement to spousal support either.

[275] The Mother did not file an updated financial statement, but produced her 2023 Notice of Assessment that showed employment income of $14,356, mostly earned prior to the parties' separation, and employment insurance benefits of $1,472. In 2024, the Mother earned $21/hour on her six-week contract position. She would have also received the Canada child benefit for I. as a low-income earner. Additionally, she received monthly child support from the Father, which is non-taxable.

[276] The Mother anticipated her temporary contract would be renewed but it was not. She remains unemployed and has not looked for other work.

[277] The Father submits the Mother has not established entitlement to support on non-compensatory principles, as she has not been proactive in her efforts to find

employment since their separation and that she could have found full-time employment in the Lower Mainland given her skill set and work experience.

[278] On the evidence before me, the Mother could expect to have annual earnings between $33,930 per annum (based on British Columbia's current minimum wage of $17.40/hour annualized) and $40,950 (which is her hourly wage of $21.00 with the [redacted for publication] annualized). Thus, the Father submits that the Mother has remained deliberately underemployed and thus has not established a need for spousal support.

[279] The situation at bar has some parallels to the case of K.D. v. N.D ., 2011 BCCA 513. In that case, the mother, K.D. , discovered she was pregnant by another man three months after the trial judgment. She had no lasting relationship with this person and did not cohabit with him. The pregnancy was unplanned and unexpected, given her earlier inability to conceive without resort to an egg donor. The mother described her pregnancy as difficult during which she was very sick.

[280] K.D. brought an application to vary the order for spousal support made at trial by postponing the date on which income would be imputed to her and the related reduction in spousal support for a further period of nine months, because she had been unable to work or retrain during her pregnancy.

[281] The chambers judge accepted that the unexpected pregnancy represented a material change in circumstances and rejected the contention that the pregnancy was a circumstance created by the mother to avoid the necessity to look for work. The chambers judge also accepted this was a difficult pregnancy with 'attendant health issues', concluding it was reasonable to vary the earlier support order by postponing the imputation of income and reduction in the quantum of spousal support from September 1, 2010 to June 1, 2011, a period of nine months. The chambers judge also postponed the review period of the support order for nine months, to June 2013 (at paras. 16-17).

[282] Although K.D. v. N.D. involved a variation of a final support order as opposed to an application for spousal support in the first instance (as in the present case), the reasoning employed the Court of Appeal is apposite to the entitlement analysis for noncompensatory support in this particular case. At paras. 50 and 51, the Court held:

[50] Similarly here, while the respondent's unanticipated pregnancy and associated illness were not directly related to the marriage or its breakdown, they occurred at a critical juncture in her attempt to deal with the economic consequences of those events, and prevented her from taking the steps anticipated by the earlier order to overcome that hardship and achieve self-sufficiency. I am satisfied that, if the trial judge had been aware of these circumstances, her order would have provided for spousal support while the respondent was incapacitated by her pregnancy.

[51] The decision of the chambers judge to extend the appellant's spousal support obligation and the future review by nine months properly accommodated that incapacity. In my view, her order represents an appropriate application of the principles of non-compensatory spousal support established in Bracklow v. Bracklow , 1999 CanLII 715 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 420, 169 D.L.R. (4th) 577, and served the objectives of spousal support set out in s. 17(7) of the Act .

[283] In this case, the Mother's pregnancy was clearly unanticipated. There is no evidence that she has been ill or unhealthy during her pregnancy.

[284] The Mother faces a period of financial need owing to her unexpected pregnancy, and given the stage of her pregnancy at trial, it is unlikely she will secure full-time employment until after the baby's birth and allowing some period for recovery from childbirth.

[285] In my opinion, the Mother has demonstrated entitlement to time-limited noncompensatory spousal support solely on the ground of need. I will award the Mother spousal support commencing December 15, 2024 and expiring on July 15, 2025, for a time limited duration of eight months. By then the Mother should return to the workforce full-time.

[286] Using the Mother's Divorcemate calculations and the 'with child formula', the Mother has an annual Guideline income of $15,828; the Father has an annual Guideline Income is $73,600. She will receive child support of $702 per month. Using the

applicable formula, this results in a range for spousal support of a low of $158 per month, a mid-point amount of $370 per month and a high of $690 per month. The midpoint amount of $370 would achieve in percentages almost an equivalent amount in net disposable income between the two households.

## ISSUE 10: CONCLUSION ON CHILD AND SPOUSAL SUPPORT

[287] Accordingly, I award the Mother spousal support in the sum of $370 per month commencing December 15, 2024, payable on the fifteenth day of each month and ending on July 15, 2025 for a term of eight months. The Mother's spousal support will terminate after that date.

- [288] The Father will pay child support to the Mother in the sum of $702 per month payable on the first day of each month. The review of child support in accordance with the shared parenting arrangements I have ordered will be postponed until after July 15, 2025, when the Mother is expected to have returned to the workforce.
- [289] Subject to this review, the parties will share the costs of I.'s Section 7 (special or extraordinary) expenses, with the Father paying 77% and the Mother paying 23% of those expenses.

[290] The parties will exercise their best efforts to reach agreement on I.'s Section 7 expenses, and failing such agreement, either party is at liberty to apply to Court for a ruling on those expenses.
