### LEGAL REASONING TRACE
JURISDICTIONAL SCRUTINY This matter falls squarely within BCSC’s inherent jurisdiction under the Divorce Act and Family Relations Act (FLA). Unlike BCPC, BCSC handles complex asset division exceeding $8M, intricate corporate structures (L. Capital LP, H. Family Trust), and high-conflict parenting disputes involving special needs—matters demanding superior precedent weight and evidentiary rigor. BCSC’s authority to pierce corporate veils (s. 18 Federal Child Support Guidelines) and address multi-jurisdictional assets (UK properties, Panamanian ventures) aligns with Chutter v. Chutter’s recognition of BCSC’s domain over high-net-worth dissolutions.

STATUTORY SUBSUMPTION Parenting (FLA s. 24; Divorce Act s. 16): Best interests centered on B.H.’s autism (s. 24(1)(a)) demanding stability/predictability. Court rejected equal parenting (respondent’s proposal) due to: (1) child’s intolerance for disruption (therapist evidence); (2) claimant’s primary caregiver role; (3) respondent’s reliance on third-party caregivers. Ordered phased access: 9-day monthly blocks + midweek visits to minimize transitions.
Asset Division (FLA ss. 58, 65): Reapportionment (65% claimant / 35% respondent) justified under s. 65(1)(e)–(f): (1) claimant’s 20-year economic disadvantage sacrificing career; (2) B.H.’s lifelong care needs diminishing self-sufficiency; (3) post-separation asset depletion (Aston Martin/GIC disposal). Stein v. Stein applied to allocate contingent tax liability (75% respondent).
Support (ss. 15–17 Divorce Act; ss. 4, 17 Guidelines): Imputed $1M income to respondent (2023+) rejecting both parties’ extremes. Basis: (1) management fees ($588K/year); (2) historical liquidity events; (3) Ouellette v. Ouellette forward-averaging. Retroactive claims denied: no blameworthy conduct (disclosure adequate), no unmet needs given lavish lifestyle.

PRECEDENTIAL ALIGNMENT Parenting: Gordon v. Goertz strictly applied—no presumption for status quo. Autistic child’s needs (B.H.) overrode maximum contact principle. M.H.K.J. v. K.J.J. reinforced claimant’s decision-making authority given expertise in autism management. Joyce model rejected; mediation mandated for deadlocks.
Assets: Lodge v. Lodge and Toth v. Toth govern reapportionment: claimant’s lost earning capacity (Master’s degree obsolete) and child-related career constraints warranted 65% home allocation. Stein’s contingent liability framework applied but adjusted for respondent’s superior earning capacity.
Support: Chutter v. Chutter and D.B.S. v. S.R.G. prevent double recovery—reapportionment addressed capital loss; spousal support ($54K/mo) compensates ongoing disadvantage.
ARGUMENT STRENGTH

Winning (Claimant):
Parenting: Medical evidence (therapists E.A., J.W.) proved B.H.’s regression risk with instability. Respondent’s travel/nanny-dependence undermined capacity.
Assets: Forensic tracing showed $894K compensation gap. s. 65(1)(f) “basket clause” captured pre-marriage cohabitation contributions.
Failing (Respondent):
Equal parenting ignored FLA s. 24(1)(a) (health needs).
$688K income claim contradicted by $826K lifestyle expenses.
Retroactive support defense failed D.B.S. test: no financial hardship proven.

JUDICIAL SENTIMENT On respondent’s conduct: “I did not find [nanny] Ms. A. to be an unbiased witness. She receives significant personal benefits… luxury vehicle, travel” (para. 73).
On extravagance: “Parties live a privileged lifestyle… children want for nothing” (para. 71).
On retroactive claims: “Claimant’s reduced lifestyle assertions lack context… [M.J.’s] European vacation subsidized” (para. 210).
IRAC/CoT SYNTHESIS

IRAC/CoT SYNTHESIS

Issue 1: Optimal parenting schedule for autistic child.
Rule: FLA s. 37 – best interests paramount; Gordon stability priority.
Application: B.H.’s therapists confirmed regression risk with frequent transitions. Respondent’s work volatility (sudden travel) incompatible with 50/50.
Conclusion: Phased access ordered – primary residence with claimant.

Issue 2: Reapportionment fairness.
Rule: FLA s. 65(1)(e)–(f) – economic independence needs.
Application: Claimant’s childcare sacrifice + B.H.’s lifelong care needs vs. respondent’s $1M+ earning capacity.
Conclusion: 65% reapportionment; $645K compensation.

Issue 3: Support income imputation.
Rule: Guidelines s. 17 – fluctuating income averaging; s. 4 – high-income adjustment.
Application: $688K (2022) aberrant low; $2.3M average excessive. $1M balances base salary + historical windfalls.
Conclusion: $1M imputed; indefinite support affirmed.
