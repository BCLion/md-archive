LEGAL REASONING TRACE
JURISDICTIONAL SCRUTINY — This is a Provincial Court of British Columbia (BCPC) decision. While BCPC judges are bound by Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) and BC Court of Appeal (BCCA) precedents, the depth of analysis and precedential weight of the decision itself is limited to its persuasive value. The Honourable Judge R. Lamperson demonstrates a meticulous, statute-driven approach characteristic of the court's family law docket, focusing intensely on the precise statutory matrix of the Family Law Act (FLA) rather than engaging in expansive common law doctrine. The analysis is functionally correct but operates within the constrained, fact-specific box of the relocation provisions.


STATUTORY SUBSUMPTION — The judge’s reasoning is a textbook application of Division 6 (Relocation) of Part 4 of the FLA. The analysis is rigidly structured around the statutory gateway tests for a relocating guardian with substantially equal parenting time under s. 69(5): (1) good faith (s. 69(6)), (2) reasonable and workable arrangements to preserve the child’s relationship with the other guardian, and (3) the child’s best interests (s. 37). The facts are cleanly mapped onto each factor. The mother’s five reasons for relocation [para 51] are systematically evaluated against the s. 69(6) good faith factors. Her detailed proposed parenting schedule [para 78] is assessed for "reasonable and workable arrangements." Finally, a granular, factor-by-factor best interests analysis under s. 37(2) is conducted [paras 83-116]. The judge correctly applies s. 37(4), avoiding consideration of parental conduct unless it substantially affects a best interests factor, as seen with the father’s communication issues [para 111].

PRECEDENTIAL ALIGNMENT — DOCTRINE + EVIDENCE — The mother prevailed on the strength of a comprehensive, evidence-based plan that proactively addressed statutory burdens and demonstrated enhanced stability. Her argument succeeded on doctrine: the "Holistic Best Interests & Caregiver Well-Being" theory. The judge accepted that the mother’s and M.W.’s improved financial outlook, housing stability, family support, and work-life balance in Port Alberni would directly and indirectly enhance A.H.’s quality of life and emotional well-being [paras 69-73, 89-90]. Crucially, she didn’t just state an intention; she provided corroborated evidence: M.W.’s business ties to Port Alberni [para 43], comparative cost analyses [paras 60-61], and a detailed, generous parenting schedule with transportation support [paras 78-79, 42]. The father’s argument failed due to a "Static Status Quo" fallacy. His opposition was rooted in a desire to maintain the existing schedule and his own convenience, couched in concern over losing weekday time. He presented no substantive alternative plan [para 80], undermined his own position by resisting beneficial programs for A.H. [para 92], and offered no evidence to refute the viability of M.W.’s business in Nanaimo or the mother’s legitimate reasons.

ARGUMENT STRENGTH — The judgment conveys a clear, albeit professionally restrained, frustration with the father’s obstructive and inconsistent stance. This is not explosive disdain but a pattern of pointed criticisms that cumulatively weaken his position: “I find it perplexing that he wishes to receive child tax benefits but has not applied for a child care subsidy” [para 63]; noting his "reluctance to immediately contribute" to healthcare costs [para 93]; observing that he “stood in the way” of recommended counseling [para 48]; and highlighting his use of “foul language” in communications [para 111]. The judge’s characterization of the mother’s reasons as “very legitimate and compelling” [para 77] juxtaposed with the father’s vague and self-concerned opposition underscores a judicial finding that the father’s position was not child-focused.

JUDICIAL SENTIMENT: Controlled but cutting: sharp rejection of father's "hunting/fishing" excuse as deliberate lie ([para 54]); strong concern over s.810 impact — "poor parental judgment," E.G. lost two friends, community aware of allegations ([para 92, 109]). Tone protective of children from risk, pragmatic on mother's isolation/finances.


IRAC/CoT SYNTHESIS
• ISSUE: Should the mother be permitted to relocate the child, A.H., from Nanaimo to Port Alberni pursuant to s. 69 of the FLA?
• RULES: Under s. 69(5), with equal parenting time, the relocating guardian (mother) must prove (a) good faith (per s.69(6) factors), (b) proposed reasonable/workable arrangements to preserve the child’s relationship with the other guardian, and (c) that the relocation is in the child’s best interests (per s.37(2)).
• APPLICATION: (a) Good Faith: The mother’s five reasons (family support, business proximity, finances, housing, opportunities) were sincere, legitimate, and addressed s.69(6) factors. Notice was proper. No binding order prohibited a final relocation. [Paras 50-77]. (b) Reasonable Arrangements: The proposed detailed schedule (3/4 weekends, half holidays, summer parity) with the mother/M.W. undertaking significant travel was found reasonable and workable. The father proposed no alternative. [Paras 78-82]. (c) Best Interests: The s.37(2) analysis found multiple benefits: enhanced emotional well-being tied to mother’s stability [89-90], strong preserved relationship with father [101], more stability via consistent school-week parent and homeownership prospect [108, 110], and the mother’s greater involvement in schooling/health decisions [86, 94, 112]. Detriments (less weekday time with father, loss of local friends) were mitigated by generous parenting time and weekend visits.
• CONCLUSION: All statutory thresholds met. Relocation permitted.

  "counsels_analysis": "<think>ISSUE: Should the mother's application to relocate with the child, A.H., from Nanaimo to Port Alberni be granted under s. 69 of the Family Law Act? RULE: The governing law is Division 6 of Part 4 of the FLA. As the guardians have substantially equal parenting time [para 10], the relocating guardian (mother) bears the burden under s. 69(5) to satisfy the court: (a) the relocation is proposed in good faith (factors in s.69(6)), (b) she has proposed reasonable and workable arrangements to preserve the child's relationship with the father, and (c) that the relocation is in the child's best interests (s.37). APPLICATION: Step 1 – Good Faith (s.69(6)): The judge meticulously applied the four non-exhaustive factors [paras 50-76]. The mother provided five compelling, evidence-backed reasons (family support, business viability, finances, housing stability, opportunities for A.H.) [51]. The judge found these sincere and legitimate [67, 77], noting proper notice was given [74] and no final order restricted relocation [76]. The father's skepticism was noted but did not undermine the good faith finding. Step 2 – Reasonable & Workable Arrangements: The mother presented a highly detailed proposed parenting schedule [78], including 3 out of 4 weekends, half holidays, and equal summer time, with her and M.W. committed to facilitating transportation [79]. The father, when pressed, could propose no alternative [80]. The judge found the plan reasonable and workable, preserving a significant amount of parenting time for the father [82]. Step 3 – Best Interests (s.37): The judge conducted a factor-by-factor analysis [83-116]. Key findings favoring relocation: A.H.'s emotional well-being is tied to the mother's, which would be enhanced by the move [89-90]; the mother is more involved in schooling/health decisions [86, 94, 112]; relocation offers more long-term stability via homeownership prospects and consistent school-week parenting [108, 110]; the father-child relationship would remain strong under the new schedule [101]. Factors against relocation (less weekday time, loss of local school friends) were deemed mitigatable [100]. The father's obstructive conduct (refusing counseling, delaying healthcare, foul language) negatively impacted his position under factors (f) and (i) [111-112]. CONCLUSION: All three statutory burdens were met on a balance of probabilities. The relocation is permitted.</think>\n\nFinal analysis: The mother secured a decisive victory by mastering the statutory formula. Her lawyer built an impeccable evidentiary record that connected concrete, adult-life advantages (finances, career, family support) to indirect benefits for the child's stability and well-being, while neutering the father's opposition by exposing its self-serving and obstructive nature. The judgment is a primer on how to successfully prosecute a relocation under the FLA's structured regime.",
