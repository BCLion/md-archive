## Introduction

- [1] This case involves competing guardianship and parenting arrangement applications in relation to a young child named L., who was born on [omitted for publication]. L. is now [omitted for publication] old.
- [2] What makes this case unusual is that the competing applications are between the applicants, who are L.,'s great uncle and aunt, and L.'s biological father. L.'s biological mother, K.C., largely supports the position of the applicants, who are her maternal uncle and aunt.
- [3] L. is currently living with the applicants at their home in the lower mainland of British Columbia, and has lived with them since shortly after his birth. L.'s father, J.G., has been living in the lower mainland on a temporary basis since July 2024, but intends to return to [omitted for publication] with L. if he is successful in this case. Thus, the consequences of this case for L. and the parties are particularly profound, as the outcome will result in L. living with the applicants in the lower mainland or living with J.G. in [omitted for publication].
- [4] The background may be summarized as follows. J.G. and K.C. began living together in a marriage-like relationship in the fall of 2022 in [omitted for publication]. K.C. became pregnant with L. in 2023. Due to K.C. having a high-risk pregnancy, she arranged to come to the lower mainland of B.C in the final weeks of her pregnancy with a view to giving birth closer to more comprehensive medical supports. The applicants agreed for her to live in their home during that period. J.G. remained in [omitted for publication] during that time with the intention of coming to B.C. for the birth.
- [5] L. was born on [omitted for publication] at BC Women's Hospital in Vancouver. J.G. was not present for the birth but arrived at the hospital the next day. He remained in B.C. for a few days and then returned to [omitted for publication]. K.C. remained in B.C. to recover from the childbirth with a plan to return to [omitted for publication] when she had recovered.

- [6] Shortly after J.G. returned to [omitted for publication], K.C. sent him a text message advising him that she wished to end their relationship.
- [7] K.C. returned to [omitted for publication] with L. on May 22, 2024. The applicants accompanied them. J.G. was not told that they had returned. Several days later, J.G. was advised that L. and K.C. were back in [omitted for publication] and he was asked to attend a meeting the next day at the office of the Director of Family and Child Services ('FCS') to discuss concerns relating to K.C.'s ability to care for L. K.C. suffers from a medical condition called MED13L, the symptoms of which include compromised cognitive functioning, as well as reduced muscle tone and fatigue.
- [8] At the meeting held on May 31, 2024, K.C. said that she was unable to care for L. on her own. E.W. said that L. had a number of health concerns that were best addressed in the lower mainland and that he had an upcoming appointment with an ENT specialist in July. Based on that assertion, J.G. reluctantly agreed to the applicants returning to the lower mainland with L. until after he had attended the appointment with the ENT specialist, following which he would be returned to [omitted for publication].
- [9] On or about July 16, 2024, L. had his appointment with the ENT specialist, which revealed nothing significant of concern.
- [10] Subsequent to that appointment, J.G. attempted to have L. returned to his care. However, the applicants refused to do so and would not allow him in person visits with L. unless he provided them with his assurance that he would comply with what they said were the doctor's recommendations that L. remain in their care.
- [11] On July 26, 2024, the applicants filed an Application About a Family Law Matter in which they sought:
7.  Cancellation of guardianship of K.C. and J.G.; and
8.  Appointment of A.W. and E.W. as guardians.

- [12] A.W. and E.W. did not advise J.G. of their application, nor immediately serve him with it. Consequently, J.G. filed an Application About a Priority Parenting Matter on July 29, 2024.
- [13] On August 13, 2024, the parties attended Court and entered into an interim without prejudice order, which provided that J.G. have two hours of parenting time, twice per week, which was to be supervised by E.W.
- [14] At a Family Management Conference on December 3, 2024, Judge Preovolos appointed the applicants and J.G. as interim guardians of L. until February 28, 2025. J.G.'s interim parenting time was expanded to three-hour visits each weekend, alternating between Saturday and Sunday. Those visits ceased to be supervised. The parties were adjourned to February 14, 2025 for an interim hearing.
- [15] When the parties appeared in Court for the interim hearing on February 14, 2025, there was insufficient court time available. As such, the parties entered into a further interim without prejudice order that provided, in part, that J.G.'s parenting times were extended to seven hour blocks once per week. The order also extended the appointment of the applicants and J.G. as interim guardians until May 13, 2025. A fourday trial was scheduled for May 12 to 15, 2025. That is the trial that I have presided over. The trial did not conclude in the four days allotted and the evidence portion of the trial concluded on June 16, 2025.
- [16] J.G. has continued to reside in the lower mainland awaiting this trial and its outcome. The interim parenting schedule set out in the order of February 14, 2025 has continued to govern. J.G. has requested overnight parenting time, but the applicants have declined to agree to any. However, at the conclusion of the evidence portion of this trial on June 16, 2024, I ordered that J.G.'s interim parenting time be increased to each weekend from Saturday at 10:00 AM to Sunday at 10:00 AM, as well as Tuesdays from 5:30 PM to 8:00 PM.
- [17] In order to conclude the trial expeditiously, the parties provided written submissions.

## Issues

- [18] The issues that must be determined are as follows:
- 1)  Guardianship:
- a.  Is J.G. a guardian? If he is not, should he be appointed as a guardian?
- b.  Should A.W. and E.W. be appointed as guardians?
- 2)  Parenting time.
- 3)  Parental responsibilities.

## Positions of the Parties

- [19] The applicants seek a final order appointing them as guardians. They are also seeking all parental responsibilities and parenting time. They oppose any order appointing or finding J.G. to be a guardian and oppose him having any parenting time whatsoever. They propose that K.C. have four supervised visits each year.
- [20] K.C. candidly acknowledges that she is unable to independently care for L. due to her disability. She supports the applicants having guardianship and primary care of L., although she wants to remain a guardian and supports J.G. being a guardian. She proposes that E.W. and A.W. to hold all of the parental responsibilities. She also proposes continuing the existing interim parenting schedule for J.G., but that if it increases, it be done gradually with periodic reviews. She also seeks parenting time for herself four times per year, for a week at a time, and would like to receive periodic updates about L.
- [21] J.G. seeks a final order appointing or finding both him and K.C. to be guardians. He also seeks all parental responsibilities and parenting time, with K.C. to have liberal and generous supervised parenting time as may be agreed between him and K.C., or K.C.'s sister, K.W. He also seeks an order permitting him to relocate with L. to [omitted for publication].

## Evidence

## E.W.

[22] E.W. is 54 years old and is married to A.W., who is K.C.'s maternal uncle. As such, she is K.C.'s maternal aunt by marriage. They have been married for ten years.

[23] E.W. was born in Hong Kong and immigrated to Canada when she was five years old. She attended university but did not complete a degree. She has worked in warehousing and with the [omitted for publication]. She has remained at home and out of the work force for the past two years.

[24] E.W. lives in [omitted for publication] with her husband. They do not have any children of their own. They had previously discussed having children and E.W. became pregnant twice, but both pregnancies were unsuccessful. She said she and A.W. were okay with not having children.

[25] As for experience with young children, E.W. said that her now 9-year-old cousin came and stayed with them as an infant. She also has three nieces and nephews who are now adults and whom she has been close to throughout their lives.

[26] E.W. first met K.C. when she began dating A.W. K.C. was in Grade 5 at the time. Over the years, they have visited K.C. and her family in [omitted for publication] three times and K.C. also came to the lower mainland to visit them. She says she is now extremely close to K.C.

[27] In August 2023, K.C. and her then boyfriend, J.G., came to the lower mainland so that K.C. could undergo a medical procedure. They stayed at K.C.'s grandparents' home. E.W. and her husband met J.G. for the first time then when they came to dinner at the grandparents' home. E.W. said that her first impressions of J.G. were that he was friendly but talked a lot. She said he also smoked and cursed a lot and had very poor personal hygiene. E.W. said that she did not trust him due to the fact that he had moved in with K.C. so quickly after they met and she felt that K.C. had poor judgment.

[28] While they were in the lower mainland, K.C. discovered that she was pregnant.

- [29] During her pregnancy, K.C. and J.G. contacted A.W. and E.W. a few times. One time they reached out to ask to borrow money to pay for J.G.'s car insurance. Another time they asked to borrow money for a flight to go to J.G.'s grandfather's funeral in [omitted for publication]. Both times, A.W. and E.W. declined to advance the money. On another occasion, they also asked A.W. and E.W. to be their child's godparents, although they later changed their minds and ultimately K.C.'s sister K.W. and her husband became the godparents.
- [30] In early February 2024, K.C. and J.G. again came to the lower mainland for a fetal monitoring appointment. A.W. and E.W. picked them up from a hotel and took them to the appointment. During that time, J.G. told E.W. that 'I love [omitted for publication] to bits.' During that appointment, they all learned for the first time that K.C. had two uteruses.
- [31] On February 14, 2024, K.C. came to live with A.W. and E.W. temporarily in the final weeks of her pregnancy, with a plan to give birth at a hospital in the lower mainland. E.W. said that she was nervous about K.C. coming to live with them, as she thought that the baby might end up in the NICU due to delayed growth of the foetus.
- [32] After K.C. arrived, E.W. discovered that she required a lot of support. She had to be taken to all of her weekly medical appointments and needed constant care. She had constant anxiety and was easily confused. Given the high risk nature of the pregnancy, they had to work to manage K.C.'s emotions so that she did not go into labour too early. She needed someone to be with her at all times.
- [33] After K.C. began living with them, E.W. heard a lot of yelling when she was on the phone with J.G. After those calls, K.C. would be in tears and would take a long time to calm down.
- [34] E.W. said that she worried about the baby, given K.C.'s disability, which she said placed her at a third grade level in reading.
- [35] L. was born on [omitted for publication] at BC Women's Hospital in Vancouver. E.W. was in the delivery room when he was born. J.G. was not present for the birth as

he was in [omitted for publication]. E.W. said that she did not notify J.G. right away when K.C. commenced labour, but did so once she was in the hospital and clearly in labour. J.G. arrived the next day.

- [36] K.C. and L. remained in hospital for seven days after his birth. J.G. remained with them in the hospital for three days and two nights, returning to [omitted for publication] on April 4.

[37] On April 7, K.C. told A.W. and E.W. that she had broken up with J.G. over the phone the previous day.

- [38] After being discharged from hospital on April 7, K.C. and L. remained living with A.W. and E.W. for the next several weeks. E.W. said that she had an open invitation to stay with them as long as she needed to.
- [39] E.W. says that after L. was born, K.C. began asking for her advice about how to manage L. She was frequently tired and overwhelmed.
- [40] K.C. also expressed concerns about the lack of cleanliness of the home in [omitted for publication] she had been sharing with J.G. She referred to there being mouse droppings in the house and their dogs defecating on the floor inside the home. E.W. also observed that there was mould on the basinet that they had brought from [omitted for publication].
- [41] At the suggestion of E.W., K.C. began seeing a counsellor named C.P. On May 21, 2024, K.C. sent J.G. a text message telling him that her counsellor wants her to put L. up for adoption with family members due to concerns about her ability to care for him. J.G. responded by saying that would never happen as L. would go to him before adoption.

[42] On May 22, 2024, K.C. and L. flew back to [omitted for publication]. They were accompanied by A.W. and E.W., who planned to return to B.C. on May 26, after K.C. and L. had settled in. No one advised J.G. that they had returned to [omitted for publication].

- [43] On May 25, K.C. asked E.W. what her relationship with L. would look like if L. came back to B.C. to be cared for by A.W. and E.W. E.W. said that she had hoped that K.C. would come to the realization on her own that she could not adequately care for L., as she did not want to tell her that herself. She was pleased when K.C. did in fact reach that conclusion on her own. She said that K.C. did not discuss her decision with J.G. Nor did E.W. think to discuss it with him. They did not tell J.G. that they had returned to [omitted for publication] from B.C. and E.W. said that she 'did not think it was fair to notify him' that L. had returned, as K.C. did not want him to know.
- [44] E.W. accompanied K.C. and L. to medical appointments in [omitted for publication] with Dr. R. on May 28 and 30. On the first of those two appointments, Dr. R.'s medical notes include the following entry:

Call: spoken with pt and her aunt - who provided me with background info: baby was born [omitted for publication] - has disabilities and pt will not be able to parent the baby, probably pt's aunt and her husband will adopt the baby

The medical notes for the second visit on May 30 include the following:

...her aunt is looking to go back to [omitted for publication] this weekend and would like to have custody of the baby…

- [45] When confronted with this note from the clinical record, E.W. said that adoption by her and A.W. was one option and another option was for L. to go to K.W. E.W. said that there was insufficient support and resources available for K.C. to assist her in parenting L. in [omitted for publication]. She did not suggest that L. being raised by his father was an option.
- [46] A meeting was scheduled at the FCS office on May 31 to discuss planning for L. At that meeting, an agreement was reached for A.W. and E.W. to return to the lower mainland with L. E.W. said that this decision was reached in the meeting and with the consent of both parents. She said that the decision was made for 'safety reasons', including concerns about J.G.'s parenting abilities, and not for medical reasons. She said that in this meeting, there was no discussion of the 'finer details', such as how long

- L. would remain with A.W. and E.W. in B.C. In cross-examination, E.W. conceded that she used the justification that L. would temporarily come with her to the lower mainland to address his medical issues to her advantage.
- [47] E.W. said that FCS had originally become involved with the family as a result of their receiving a report from hospital staff in Vancouver regarding concerns about K.C.'s ability to independently care for L. E.W. expressed her dissatisfaction with the work done by FCS, as she said that they conducted an inspection of J.G.'s home and then closed their file, without having assessed his ability to parent. However, social worker C.R. advised that it is not their role to conduct parenting capacity assessments.
- [48] E.W. returned to B.C. with L. on June 2, 2024.
- [49] After returning to B.C., E.W. followed up with their paediatrician, Dr. D.R. They also connected with the community health nurse and the child development team to assist with physiotherapy and to address feeding issues with L. They also connected with an occupational therapist, a speech and language pathologist, and obtained a referral to an ENT specialist.
- [50] When L. was seen by the ENT specialist on July 16, E.W. was advised that there were no significant problems from an ENT perspective. She wrote to J.G. advising him of how well the appointment went, but concluded with the following statement:

...which is a bit unfortunate as the doctor upon first impression was wondering what we were doing there at all.

- [51] When she advised J.G. of the results of the appointment, he responded with the following:

Hi, that's great news!  I am so happy it's not too serious.  It is, but nothing like I was scared it was.  I was going to message you around noon today to ask about it.  I will be living in [omitted for publication], starting next week, and I will be staying there until [L.] is able to come home.

- [52] However, in messages between them over the following days, E.W. emphasized the continued problem with L.'s lack of weight gain and that it was important to not

disrupt the stability that he was experiencing living with them and supported by a medical team. When J.G. asked if he could pick up L., E.W. told him that he would have to 'go through the ministry'. However, when J.G. contacted a social worker for the ministry, he was told that they were not involved. Ultimately, A.W. and E.W. would not permit J.G. to see L. until after the matter proceeded to a court hearing on August 13.

[53] Since August 2024, L. has generally had weekly medical appointments. He has seen his paediatrician, Dr. B., approximately monthly. E.W. says that some medical services that L. accesses in B.C. are not comparable in [omitted for publication], although she did not provide any details.

[54] The first court order in this proceeding was made on August 13, 2024, granting supervised visits between J.G. and L. for two hours at a time on Tuesdays and Thursdays. E.W. was the supervisor, although J.G. asked to have his aunt and uncle attend as well. Unfortunately there were times when his aunt and uncle were unavailable and consequently those visits were cancelled. When the supervised visits began, A.W. and E.W. brought most of the necessities for the visit, although J.G. began to learn and take on more responsibilities. He began bringing his own formula after E.W. asked him to. E.W. denies 'shushing' A.W. or having to calm him down during a supervised visit.

[55] After the order of December 7, 2024, visits became unsupervised and were extended to three hours each week. Following the order of February 14, 2025, the visits were extended to seven hours, once per week.

- [56] Since unsupervised visits began, E.W. has had some concerns. On January 12, 2025, J.G. texted saying that he would be late in returning L. saying L. had wet himself. When she phoned him back, she could hear L. screaming in distress. When he arrived 30 minutes late, L. was still screaming in distress but stopped crying as soon as he saw her. She said that she noticed that L. had a heat rash in his diaper area. I note that this was during the time that J.G.'s visits were three hours long and it is hard to attribute diaper rashes to him on such short visits. She says L. has come home with diaper rashes other times as well. When L. returns from the seven hour visits with J.G., he

sleeps longer than he usually does, even though J.G. says that he has two naps during the visit.

- [57] E.W. also complains that J.G. feeds L. a lot of prepared baby foods such as Gerber jars, which she believes should rarely be consumed. She says that he also puts the diapers on too tight.
- [58] She says that J.G. generally attends all of L.'s medical appointments, although he has missed a few, due to traffic, being unable to get off work or being in the hospital. When he is not able to attend, she provides him with medical updates by e-mail.
- [59] E.W. said that she does not consider J.G. to be a safe parent, as she believes he hits his dog and has yelled at K.C. for making a mistake about an appointment.
- [60] E.W. said that if she and her husband are successful in this trial, they will keep K.C. and J.G. involved, although she did not clarify what she meant by that.
- [61] Since being in their care, A.W. and E.W. have taken L. to the Fraser Region Aboriginal Centre a few times, and have taken him to a pow-wow.

[62] In cross-examination, E.W. acknowledged that when she and her husband had initially learned that K.C. was pregnant, he had said to her, 'Are you ready to take on a baby?' She responded to him by saying, 'Don't even think about it.' She also acknowledged that she had later discussed adopting L. with her husband and K.C.'s sister, K.W. However, she said that was not a plan but rather was a 'contingency'. It was not entirely clear what she meant by that.

## A.W.

[63] A.W. is the husband of E.W. He is 46 years old. He is employed by [omitted for publication].

[64] A.W. does not have any children of his own. He said that while he has a number of nieces and nephews, prior to L. coming into his care, he had limited exposure to children.

[65] A.W. is K.C.'s uncle. He has known K.C. since she was born. However, given the distance between them, they generally have not seen each other more often than once per year. They also occasionally spoke on the phone. He said that he sees K.C. as someone operating at the level of an eight-year-old child, which he sometimes finds frustrating.

[66] A.W. first learned of J.G. from K.C. He said that from the beginning of their relationship, K.C. maintained that she did not know why she was in a relationship with him but did not know how to get out of it.

[67] The first time A.W. met J.G. was when he and K.C. came to British Columbia in August 2023 for a medical procedure for her. The couple stayed at A.W.'s parents' home. The first thing he noticed about J.G. was his body odour, which he said he could smell from 10 feet away. He also observed that he talked a lot and cut off K.C. when she was talking.

[68] When A.W. later learned that K.C. was pregnant, he confirmed that he said to his wife, 'Are you prepared to take on a child?' and that she responded by saying to him, 'Don't you dare even think about that.' A.W. is 45 years old and was not looking to raise a child. He said that when he met E.W., she was 39 years old and as such, they both knew that it would be a challenge for them to conceive a child, so they did not put much effort into it. He said that his wife had two miscarriages about five to 10 years ago. He took initial steps to inquire about adoption about five years ago, but did not take any further steps after that.

[69] The second time A.W. met J.G. was when the couple came to British Columbia for another medical appointment, this time related to K.C.'s pregnancy. The couple stayed at a hotel near the hospital and A.W. and E.W. assisted them by driving them to and from the hospital for their appointment.

[70] During K.C.'s pregnancy, A.W. and E.W. did not assist her financially, although they did stay in more frequent contact than they had previously. At one point, K.C. asked them for a loan of $700 to insure J.G.'s vehicle. He did not loan them the money.

- [71] After K.C. began living with A.W. and E.W. during the final stages of her pregnancy, A.W. said that he overheard phone calls between K.C. and J.G. in which he could hear J.G. yelling at her. He said this was very upsetting for K.C., from which it would take her two to three hours to recover. For some reason, A.W. and E.W. took a photograph of K.C. during that episode, which they submitted in to evidence.
- [72] At the time of L.'s birth, A.W. had understood that the plan was for K.C. and L. to fly back to [omitted for publication] a couple of weeks after the birth. However, they remained in B.C. for six weeks. At the time of his birth, there were no urgent medical issues for L., other than his low birth weight. Despite his low weight, he was discharged after six days.
- [73] A.W. said that he learned that K.C. and J.G. had broken up through K.C.'s sister K.W., and J.G. The day after their break up, he helped K.C. prepare a text message on his phone to send to J.G. confirming their break up. He said he sent it to J.G. upon her instructions to do so, on April 7. He denies that he had anything to do with the break up beyond sending that text message. He said that he did not recall telling J.G. following L.'s birth that he and K.C. should break up.
- [74] Following their break up, A.W. said that J.G. was sending abusive text messages to K.C., so A.W. insisted that any communication with her be by way of the group chat, which included him. There was no evidence of abusive messages to support A.W.'s assertion. In fact, messages from J.G. on their group chat are uniformly respectful and largely in the nature of seeking updates on L.'s health and development. When J.G. asked about sending money to K.C. or A.W. to assist with L., the offer was met with a blunt 'no' from A.W.
- [75] A.W. and E.W. accompanied K.C. and L. to [omitted for publication], when they finally returned there in late May. While he was still in [omitted for publication], A.W. attended a meeting with two social workers. K.C. was at those meetings, during which he said she raised concerns about J.G. That was prior to the meeting of May 31 that J.G. attended.

[76] A.W. returned home to B.C. on his own. He said that two to three days later he learned that L. would be coming back to B.C. with his wife. He understood that L. was coming back to B.C. as there was no one able to care for him in [omitted for publication] and because he had some medical issues, although he was not clear what those issues were. He said that K.C. asked A.W. and E.W. to take L. with them due to her concerns about J.G. He was not aware of there being any pre-determined duration on how long L. would stay with them in B.C., but he understood that the purpose of him staying with them was to assist him to 'thrive'. He said that in his opinion, J.G. was not an appropriate caregiver for L.

[77] Since coming to live with A.W. and E.W., A.W. said that L. has had weekly medical appointments. A.W. and E.W. have attended all of those appointments. His medical team currently includes a paediatrician, nurses, physiotherapist, occupational therapist and a speech/language pathologist. Since J.G. began attending the appointments, which he was permitted to do by the August 13 court order, he has attended all but two or three of his appointments. A.W. complains that J.G. seems more interested in engaging with L. during those appointments than listening to the medical providers.

[78] A.W. and E.W. were aware that J.G. was coming to the lower mainland in July to retrieve L. and take him back to [omitted for publication]. They were also aware that he said he would bring L. to his remaining medical appointments in B.C. before returning to [omitted for publication]. A.W. confirmed that they nonetheless refused to allow him any access to L. unless he would commit to not removing L. from their care. They also refused to advise him of their address. They would not allow him any access until they went to Court, which A.W. said was in accordance with doctor's orders. There was no evidence of any such doctor's orders.

[79] Unsupervised visits between J.G. and L. began following the December court order. After that, A.W. said that L. would return after three visits being tired, although he adjusted over time. A.W. also noted, what he believed to be, safety concerns about J.G.'s vehicle, such as it having glue attaching the rear window. He also noted that J.G.

does not wear his prescription glasses while driving, which A.W. also considers a safety concern.

- [80] In cross-examination, A.W. conceded that he sometimes openly criticizes J.G. for his care of L. and has laughed at him. He also admits to talking down to him in the presence of others, although he denies ever calling him useless. He says that J.G. remained calm during the phase of supervised visits, even in the face of A.W.'s open criticism of him.
- [81] A.W. also expressed concern that J.G. does not tie his shoelaces and on one occasion, almost tripped while carrying L. On another occasion, he observed him carrying L. in the rain with no toque or umbrella.

[82] Once the current seven-hour visits began in February 2025, A.W. identified a number of additional concerns. He said that J.G. does not listen when they advise him at the beginning of each visit what L. has recently eaten and drank. He said that J.G. claims to write down the schedule of what he does during the visits but A.W. does not believe that he does. On one occasion, L. was returned from a visit with a heat rash, which J.G. brought to their attention. A.W. also expressed concerns about the cleanliness of J.G.'s home. Also, L. often eats and naps when he is returned from a visit.

- [83] With respect to the list of concerns A.W. has enumerated, I note that J.G. has kept detailed journal entries describing each of his visits since February 16, all of which were in evidence. Those entries include information that he learned from A.W. and E.W. at the commencement of his visit. It is to the credit of J.G. that he identified the heat rash and let A.W. and E.W. know about it at the end of the visit. A.W. has never been to J.G.'s residence and has no basis for questioning its cleanliness. Finally, a one year old eating and napping following a seven hour visit is hardly notable and certainly not worthy of concern.
- [84] In cross-examination, A.W. acknowledged that no medical professionals have ever said that J.G. cannot parent full time.

## Brandon Bodnarchuk

[85] Brandon Bodnarchuk is a private investigator who was hired by A.W. and E.W. to 'investigate the safety of a child'. His evidence consisted of the following:

-  He observed J.G. drive through an intersection on a yellow light with the light turning red while he was in the intersection.
-  On a different occasion, he observed J.G. run a red light while L. was in the car with him.
-  On one occasion, he observed J.G. driving while wearing black aviator sunglasses. He had been advised that J.G. wears prescription glasses. In cross-examination, he acknowledged the possibility that the sunglasses are prescription.
-  He observed several vehicles outside J.G.'s residence, which he believed suggested that several people live at that residence. In crossexamination, he acknowledged that the vehicles could belong to visitors to the residence.

## Ryan Finn

[86] Ryan Finn is a part-time private investigator, who was employed by Mr. Bodnarchuk's firm, BBI Investigations. He said that he understood the purpose of the investigation was a 'child welfare' investigation and to confirm J.G.'s residence. His evidence consisted of the following:

-  On one occasion, he observed J.G. speeding, with L. in the vehicle. He said that he followed J.G. at a speed of up to 120 KMH in a 90 KMH zone. He assumed that J.G. may have been going as fast as 140 KMH, although he did not have a speed radar gun and acknowledged that he had no way of knowing how fast he was actually travelling.

## Dr. D.R.

[87] Dr. D.R. is L.'s former primary care paediatrician. L. was under her care from his first visit of April 30 to June 18, 2024, a period of approximately six weeks. She has not provided care for L. since he was six weeks old. She provided an affidavit, and attended the trial by video for cross-examination.

[88] Dr. D.R. said that while she was involved in L.'s care, A.W. and E.W. were loving towards L. and were diligent in his medical care. While she was seeing L., she felt that it was in his best interests to remain in the lower mainland to continue his medical care, given the complexity of his needs and in particular, his need to see an ENT specialist, which was not available in [omitted for publication]. On July 4, she prepared a letter for A.W. and E.W., in which she advocated for L. to remain in the care of A.W. and E.W.

[89] Dr. D.R. was aware of J.G. but never met him or spoke to him. She acknowledged that any competent and caring caregiver should be able to follow her advice or that of another paediatrician.

## K.C.

[90] K.C. is of course L.'s mother. She is a respondent in this proceeding and supports the position of A.W. and E.W. being the guardians and permanent caregivers for L.

[91] K.C. is [omitted for publication] years old. She resides by herself in [omitted for publication].

- [92] She has been diagnosed with a medical condition called MED13L. She describes it as a learning disability which also causes fatigue and poor muscle tone. She says she easily becomes tired. She needs assistance with reading, speaking and spelling. She describes her literacy as being at a grade three level.

[93] A Psychological Assessment for Incapacity was prepared by a psychologist on August 19, 2024, shortly after this litigation had commenced. The report notes K.C.'s significant cognitive deficits related to MED13L and in particular, the weaknesses adversely impacting her ability to function independently, exhibit good judgment, reason and make sound decisions. The psychologist expresses the opinion that she is incapable of making her own decisions in important personal, financial and care matters. That psychological report appears to form the basis for an order made by the Supreme Court of [omitted for publication] on October 28, 2024, appointing K.C.'s sister,

K.W., as her adult guardian, which includes the power to make decisions in legal proceedings, as well as many other areas.

[94] K.C. graduated from high school through a disability program. She is not currently working and receives disability income assistance. However, she has worked in the past including jobs at [omitted for publication]. She is Indigenous, being a member of the [omitted for publication].

[95] K.C. met J.G. in 2022, when they were both working at [omitted for publication]. Shortly after beginning to date, they moved in together, along with J.G.'s brother. She described the first house they lived in as having plumbing problems, such that they did not have running water. She described their dogs as defecating on the floor indoors, which she said J.G. expected her to clean up.

[96] After leaving that first home, the three of them moved to an apartment. However, K.C. said that the dogs continued to defecate indoors and she was again expected to clean up the mess. At that point, the fatigue symptoms of her disability had gotten worse such that she was no longer able to work at [omitted for publication].

[97] They were eventually evicted from that home and she and J.G. moved to a home situated on property owned by K.C.'s extended family. They were living there together during the last part of K.C.'s pregnancy. J.G. continues to live in that house.

[98] At some point, J.G. was also laid off from his job. K.C. said that after he was laid off, he spent most of his time watching television and playing video games. Although he did apply for some jobs and went to some interviews, he was unsuccessful as he rarely showered and did not have clean clothes. While they were together, she says that they were regular users of the local food bank. J.G.'s family sometimes provided them with financial help.

[99] K.C. learned that she was pregnant when she was undergoing a procedure to remove skin from her uterus. She said that she was afraid that J.G. would break up with her when he found out, but he did not. Rather, he wanted to tell others, while K.C. asked him to keep the information secret until they decided what to do. Despite her

request for privacy, she says that J.G. began telling everyone. She agrees that he was excited at the prospect of having a child.

[100] K.C. described her pregnancy as 'not great'. She was not gaining weight and was highly stressed, in part due to the conflict she and J.G. were having. She acknowledges that for years she has had problems gaining weight. She said that J.G. was concerned about that and attempted to assist her in gaining weight. Indeed, text messages between J.G. and K.C.'s sister K.W. demonstrate considerable compassion on his part regarding this issue and demonstrate him trying to learn more so that he could assist her with her weight gain, as well as her mental health.

[101] She said that she wanted to take pre-natal vitamins but J.G. refused to buy them as they were too expensive. She says that she eventually bought them on her own behind his back. She also said that she was often depressed during her pregnancy, to the point of having suicidal thoughts. She claims that J.G. was not emotionally supportive of her and did not show her any affection.

[102] K.C. said that J.G. came to a number of her medical appointments during the pregnancy, although he did not attend all of them. When he was unable to attend, her sister K.W. accompanied her. He accompanied her to at least one appointment in B.C. during the pregnancy.

[103] At some point during her pregnancy, she learned that she had two cervixes and a split vagina. Those complications led to her being advised to have a C-section birth, which was recommended to be done in the lower mainland of B.C. As such, she flew to B.C. on February 14 before it became too late for her to fly. She remained living with her aunt and uncle in anticipation of the birth.

[104] After K.C. arrived in B.C. on February 14, she and J.G. remained in regular contact by phone and text. She said that during that time they had a lot of arguments, as many as three times each week.

[105] Text messages show that J.G. had hoped to be present for the birth However, given that L. was born prematurely and J.G. did not have any advance notice, he was

unable to attend the birth. He flew to B.C. on [omitted for publication], the day after L. was born. He remained with K.C. and L. at the hospital for three days, before returning home to [omitted for publication].

[106] While J.G. was with her in the hospital, K.C. says that he was on his phone a lot and not very helpful to her. On one occasion, he even refused to help her when she asked, saying he was too tired. She said that he grabbed her breast once when she was breast feeding and asked to have sex with her, even though she had just had a Csection. She did acknowledge that he encouraged her to eat more while in the hospital and assisted her in walking to and from the bathroom. He kept making her laugh, which was painful due to her recent C-section.

[107] Following L.'s birth, they had an argument about what to use as L.'s last name on his birth certificate. Each parent wanted to use their own last name. They eventually reached a compromise by giving him a hyphenated surname, using both of their surnames.

[108] K.C. said that she has concerns about J.G.'s tendency to act out in anger. She said that in the past, he has bent the gate on a dog kennel, thrown a pot on the floor and bent his prescription glasses, all acts done in anger. She said that he has also hit his dog so hard that his hand went numb. When asked about a hospital record note that states that he has anger issues and should not be in the delivery room for the birth, K.C. said that she probably told the hospital staff that. While she says that he was emotionally abusive, she denied that he has ever been physically abusive towards her.

[109] K.C. said that she broke up with J.G. by text message a few days after L. was born. She said that one of the reasons she decided to break up with him was because she was afraid of J.G.'s ex-girlfriend, who J.G. said he was afraid of. She said that she had previously wanted to break up with him but was scared to follow through. However, she also said that during their relationship she had been doing research to find her own place, but that when J.G. found out, he said that he would break up with her if she moved out, so she decided to stay. That is at odds with her assertion that she wanted to break up with him.

[110] K.C. said that during her pregnancy she had many discussions with A.W. and E.W. about her relationship with J.G. They expressed to her the 'red flags' that she was raising and told her to think about whether she wanted to continue the relationship with him. She said that they were very supportive of her decision to break up with J.G.

- [111] After returning to [omitted for publication] on May 22, 2024 with L. and A.W. and E.W., K.C. did not tell J.G. that she was there. In fact, her text messages with J.G. before and after she returned to [omitted for publication] show that she was clearly intending to mislead him into believing that she and L. were still in B.C. with no clear plans on when they would return. She says that she was afraid of him knowing that she was back. That assertion is in contrast to the text messages between them in late May and throughout June, which show considerable affection and empathy between them.
- [112] After she returned to [omitted for publication] with L., K.C. attempted to care for L. but found that it was too difficult. Despite her efforts, L. lost weight over the few days that he was there in her care. She then decided that she would be unable to adequately care for L. and that A.W. and E.W. would be best suited to do so. As such, she resolved to give L. to them.
- [113] K.C. acknowledged that her counsellor had encouraged her to place L. for adoption with family. When she communicated that to J.G., he told her that will never happen, as L. would go to him before adoption would be considered. He also assured her that they could co-parent but that if L. were instead to be with him, he would assure that she remained involved.
- [114] At the meeting held at the [omitted for publication] office on May 31, K.C. said that an agreement was reached for L. to return to B.C. with A.W. and E.W. She said that it was solely her decision to place L. with A.W. and E.W. and that she was not pressured into that decision. She reached that decision only after she returned to [omitted for publication] with L.
- [115] By June 9, K.C. said she knew that L. would be remaining in B.C. for the long term. She did not, however, communicate that to J.G., despite having ongoing regular

contact with him. During those conversations, J.G. was telling her the steps he was continuing to take to have his home ready for L. to return to.

[116] J.G. advised K.C. on July 17 that he was planning to travel to B.C. the following week. She stopped communicating with him then, but on July 24, she sent him a text message in which she told him that she had asked A.W. and E.W. to take care of L. and to not give him to J.G. She told him that if he had any questions about L., he should contact A.W. and E.W. and that she was then blocking him. She testified that her sister helped her to type this message but that the words were hers.

[117] Despite her desire that A.W. and E.W. permanently care for L., K.C. says that she would like J.G. to be in L.'s life as much as possible. She says that she would like to live close to L., but that she cannot right now, as her sister K.W. is her guardian and she lives in [omitted for publication]. She is aware that A.W. and E.W. originally applied to terminate her guardianship but that 'they were confused' and now want her to remain a guardian. She does not believe that she should have decision-making authority, however.

[118] Since he returned to B.C. a year ago, K.C. has come to visit L. three times. She also has weekly video calls with him. L. has not been back to [omitted for publication]. She would also like L. to remain in B.C. to be closer to the medical resources that she believes he needs to thrive. She agrees that J.G. is doing everything he can to get L. into his care.

## C.R.

[119] C.R. is a child protection social worker employed in [omitted for publication] with [omitted for publication] Family Services ('FCS'). She has been a social worker for eight years and is currently a [omitted for publication].

[120] C.R. first became involved with this family on May 9, 2024, when an enhancement file was opened. The file related to the concern that K.C. may not have the capacity to care for L. due to her disability. That is distinct from a protection file.

[121] She met J.G. for the first time at the meeting held on May 31, 2024. In addition to him, K.C., E.W., and J.G.'s mother, L.H., were present at that meeting. C.R. said that the purpose of the meeting was to plan for L.'s care, given that he had medical issues that needed to be addressed in B.C. She said that the parents ultimately agreed to L. going to B.C. with A.W. and E.W. to address the medical issues and that they expected him to be returned to [omitted for publication] after the medical issues were addressed. She said that J.G. was very clear that he wanted L. to be returned to his full or part time care. There was however, no definitive plan for when that would occur. It was agreed that A.W. and E.W. would provide both parents with medical updates on L. while he was in B.C. and that the parents would provide them with medical consents.

[122] C.R. said that J.G. appeared to have L.'s best interests in mind. He planned to stay at home to care for L. until he was a year old and then return to work. He also indicated that he intended to take parenting education, enrol in counselling and engage with resources for L. in anticipation of his return.

[123] During their meeting, C.R. said that J.G. was calm, engaged in the conversation, and held and interacted with L.

[124] The day after their meeting, J.G. sent her an e-mail expressing his disappointment that L. had been in [omitted for publication] for several days before the meeting without him knowing of it. He asked C.R. to come to his home for a home visit and asked for contact information for a potential doctor and other resources for L. Those included parenting education, childcare, the child development centre and transportation support. When she attended his home on June 10, C.R. did not note any safety concerns, noting the presence of a crib, bath, toys and other accessories necessary for an infant. She said that the home visit was voluntary on the part of J.G. and in fact, was requested by him.

[125] On June 21, E.W. sent C.R. an e-mail in which she expressed concerns about J.G.'s home, something that had not been raised at the May 31 meeting. In C.R.'s email response, she said that based on the information she had, there was nothing to say that J.G. could not care for L. on a full or part time basis. E.W.'s e-mail in response to

that expressed her deep dissatisfaction with C.R.'s conclusion regarding J.G. and inquired whether there will be restrictions on J.G.'s parenting time should L. go into his care.

[126] On June 22, J.G. and his mother met with C.R. to express his concerns that L. may not be returned to [omitted for publication].

[127] Given the absence of any child protection concerns in relation to J.G., their file was closed on July 25, 2024. C.R. said that if L. returns to [omitted for publication] with J.G. they would not re-open a file, unless J.G. requests support.

## A.G.

[128] A.G. is the half-brother of J.G. Given that he has the same surname as J.G. I will refer to him as A. to avoid any confusion.

[129] He has lived with J.G. and K.C. in two residences. He said that they were evicted from their first shared residence as they were unable to put the hydro account in their names.

[130] He said that generally his brother and K.C. got along and appeared to be in love. A few times, they had disagreements but resolved them by talking it out and apologized to one another. He says that the worst dispute he observed led to K.C. throwing a bag of frozen beans at J.G. but later apologizing. He acknowledged that the frequency of their arguments increased over time, and in particular after she began living in B.C. He never saw either of them being physically abusive with the other.

[131] A. was aware of K.C. having an intellectual disability. However, he did not observe her having any difficulties functioning like an average and independent adult.

[132] A. said that while the three of them were living together, they shared the house cleaning duties, although after K.C. stopped working, she was at home more and took on more of that work. Each of them had a dog and for a time, two of the dogs were very ill and frequently defecated inside the house. He said that J.G. did the majority of the cooking for the three of them.

[133] He says that while he has not seen J.G. with L., he has seen him with other children and he is comfortable, calm and patient with them.

[134] In June 2024, A. moved to [omitted for publication]. However shortly after he moved, J.G. called him to ask if he could return to [omitted for publication] and move into J.G.'s home there to ensure that the pipes did not freeze while he was in B.C. due to the present litigation. A. did so and remains living there until J.G. returns. He said that the home includes a room for L. that is equipped with a crib and the necessary appurtenances for an infant.

## C.E.

[135] C.E. is a long-time family friend of J.G. He and his wife have known J.G. since he was 20 years old and he considers himself to be J.G.'s uncle. He is employed as an [omitted for publication]. He and his wife have three children, ages 22, 19 and 18, all of whom reside at home.

[136] In July 2024, C.E. learned that J.G. intended to come to the lower mainland to pick up his son L. and return to [omitted for publication] with him. He agreed to have J.G. reside with them temporarily, as he prepared to take L. home. However, after a month of sleeping on their couch, J.G. found his own place to live.

[137] After J.G. arrived in B.C. and began staying with them, J.G. advised C.E. that he initially was not permitted by A.W. and E.W. to see L. unless he agreed to commit to not taking L. from them. Later, when the matter landed in Court for the first time and A.W. and E.W. insisted that his parenting time with L. be supervised by them, C.E. asked to include himself or his wife in the visits, so as to protect J.G. against allegations being made against him by A.W. and E.W. Once the supervised visits began following the August 13 consent order, C.E. or his wife attended all of the supervised visits.

[138] During those supervised visits, C.E. described J.G. as being extremely attentive and competent and not requiring assistance from others. He prepared L.'s bottle, fed him, checked and changed his diaper, put him to sleep, played with him and talked with him. He describes him as a wonderful, caring and loving father to L.

[139] During the period when he was attending the supervised visits, C.E. said that on occasion, he suggested to A.W. that a father needs more than two, two-hour visits each week to bond with a child. That caused A.W. to become angry and aggressive. When C.E. suggested having visits at the Ministry office on Thursdays, he said that A.W. again became angry and aggressive and threatened to file a protection order against J.G. On both of these occasions, he said that E.W. had to intervene to de-escalate A.W.

[140] C.E. also said that during the supervised visits, A.W. frequently made comments belittling J.G. for how he was handling L. and his abilities as a parent. A.W. also told J.G. that he smelled, was poorly dressed and was aggressive. J.G. did not respond to any of those comments and remained calm and focussed on L. Despite these critical comments, C.E. said that A.W. and E.W. did not appear to have any genuine concerns about J.G.'s care for L., as they generally sat at a distance on their phones or computers rather than actively supervising.

[141] More recently, J.G. celebrated L.'s first birthday at C.E.'s home. J.G. brought an 'exer-saucer', a high chair, and a diaper bag with supplies including food. Throughout the birthday, J.G. was fully engaged with L. and L. appeared to enjoy the visit. A number of photographs from the birthday party were in evidence, all of which confirm a happy and content L.

## S.E.

[142] S.E. is C.E.'s wife and also a long-time family friend of J.G.'s. S.E. describes having known J.G. for 14 years. She shares three children with C.E. She is a [omitted for publication] with [omitted for publication].

- [143] S.E. testified that she and her family saw J.G. regularly when they all lived in [omitted for publication]. She says that J.G. is like a big brother to her children and is someone who would give you the shirt off his back. Despite them moving to British Columbia and J.G. moving to [omitted for publication], they have remained close.

[144] J.G. came and lived with them in July 2024 on a temporary basis, while he made arrangements to return to [omitted for publication] with L. However, that arrangement

lasted 3½ months before J.G. eventually went out and found his own residence, given that the court proceedings were protracted. (I note that C.E. said that he stayed with them for a month, although that discrepancy is not relevant.)

- [145] S.E. attended one of the supervised visits which occurred at the Pitt Meadows airport. She said she found the visit to be quite unsettling as the visit was being filmed by A.W. and E.W. and she said that A.W. was staring at her throughout the visit. E.W. asked if she could record her conversation with her to which she agreed, on the basis that she too would record the conversation. E.W. then discussed with her why she and her husband were a better parenting option for L. than J.G. E.W. also encouraged S.E. to read the affidavits and told her that she did not trust the social workers.
- [146] After J.G.'s visits became unsupervised, S.E. saw L. with J.G. many times. On those occasions she observed J.G. to be loving, caring and attentive with L.

## L.H.

- [147] L.H. is J.G.'s mother. J.G. is the eldest of her three children. She is employed as a [omitted for publication].
- [148] She has lived in [omitted for publication] for 13 years. She currently lives alone, although she previously lived with her wife, J., for 11 years.
- [149] Two of her young grandchildren spend the weekend with her in alternate weekends.
- [150] She does not drink alcohol during the week, and always has another responsible present if she drinks on the weekend when her grandchildren are in her care.
- [151] L.H. met K.C. after she and J.G. began dating. She observed them to have a loving relationship, although K.C. did tell her about some of the arguments they had. She was aware that they separated shortly after J.G. returned to [omitted for publication] after L. was born. She said that the couple had been occupied with planning for the arrival of their child and J.G. cried for a week when K.C. ended the relationship.

[152] The first time L.H. saw L. was at the meeting on May 31 at the social worker's office. She had believed the purpose of the meeting was to discuss co-parenting arrangements, but was surprised to discover that the focus was on L.'s health issues and in particular, his breathing problems. She also learned at the meeting that K.C. felt she was unable to care for L., which came as a shock to L.H.

- [153] E.W. discussed an upcoming specialist appointment in July and that she wanted to take L. back to B.C. for that. J.G. began crying, as it was the first time he had seen L. in six weeks and did not want to see him leave again. L.H. then said to E.W. that J.G. was afraid L. would not come back, to which E.W. said, 'I have integrity'. L.H. then encouraged J.G. to allow her to temporarily take him to B.C. for medical purposes.

[154] L.H. has been present for three of J.G.'s supervised visits and has been able to spend time with L. during those visits. She says that her son has grown up around children and is comfortable with them.

- [155] L.H. expressed a strong desire to be part of L.'s life. She works with children with high needs and is well versed in working with their specific needs. While she works full time, she lives just 10 minutes away from J.G. She is able to babysit and is able to cancel her clients at any time to accommodate J.G.'s needs with L. She also is entitled to 10 sick days each school year and can take those days as necessary to assist with L. She says that J.G. has a village to support him and L.

[156] L.H. has been to all three residences of J.G., including the one without running water, which she described as messy. The second one was also messy, partly due to their dogs being ill.

[157] She has loaned J.G. money in the past, but he has always paid her back.

## J.G.

[158] J.G. is L.'s father. He is [omitted for publication] years old. He was born and raised in [omitted for publication] but has lived in [omitted for publication] since 2020.

[159] He is currently employed as an [omitted for publication] in [omitted for publication], B.C. He has been employed there since November 14, 2024. Previously, he worked in airport security in [omitted for publication] for 2½ years. He was terminated from that job, although the reasons for his termination are not relevant to these proceedings.

[160] J.G. met K.C. while they were both working at the airport. They dated for a couple of months and then found a place to live together outside [omitted for publication], along with J.G.'s brother. They later moved to a condominium in [omitted for publication] where they lived together with their three or four dogs until October 2024.

[161] J.G. and K.C. then moved to a home on property owned by her extended family. J.G. continues to maintain that home in anticipation of returning there with L. Currently, his brother has agreed to live there and pay a portion of the rent until he returns. He is also paying the rent on the shared suite that he lives in in [omitted for publication].

[162] J.G. said that he loved K.C. very much and felt that they had a good relationship. He said that the relationship grew stronger after she became pregnant, although they did have some disagreements from time to time. Following one argument, he drove her to her mother's house where she remained for a day before returning. He said that K.C. is very sensitive and when she gets upset, she disappears to her room. He said the best tool to resolve their disputes is to give her a hug.

[163] He denies ever acting out in anger and specifically disputes the allegations that he bent the dog gate in anger or struck any of the dogs. He denies ever threatening to put down K.C.'s dog. He said that his stepmother had suggested that, but he had proposed puppy school. He acknowledges that when they moved into their second home together, he did not disclose to the landlord that K.C. had a cat, which was not permitted under the lease. That omission led to K.C. having to give away her cat. J.G. acknowledged his fault with that and repeatedly apologized to K.C. for it, but said that they were under pressure to find a home.

[164] At the first home they lived in together, their dogs became very ill and incontinent. He eventually had to euthanize his dog, although the other two dogs eventually recovered. While they were ill, the dogs frequently defecated inside the house. That issue continued for a time in the second house before the two dogs recovered.

[165] When they moved to the third house, which is referred to as the yellow house, they originally had a problem with mice. However, that issue was resolved after K.C. left and J.G. says it is no longer a problem and the house is completely safe for a child.

[166] J.G. acknowledges that they were on a tight budget while he and K.C. lived together. Initially they were both working. She then left her job and began collecting income assistance. Later, he was laid off and he began collecting Employment Insurance. He acknowledges that when he received a large GST cheque, he purchased a Play Station. However, he says that he also used the funds for other expenses, such as renewing his vehicle insurance.

[167] In August 2023, J.G. accompanied K.C. to B.C. for her to have a procedure to remove a growth in her uterus. That led to the discovery of her pregnancy. J.G. described his feelings as being scared, happy and elated at the prospect of becoming a parent. K.C. was afraid of what her family would say and asked him to not tell anyone about the pregnancy. It was during that visit to B.C. that J.G. met A.W. and E.W. for the first time when they came to K.C.'s home for a visit. They did not tell A.W. and E.W. about the pregnancy at that time. They eventually began to tell family members.

[168] After they returned to [omitted for publication], they began to prepare to be parents by collecting baby items. K.C. attended medical appointments, some of which J.G. accompanied her to. He believed that they were taking steps to raise the child together. They even discussed having K.C.'s sister and J.G.'s mother coming to assist them after the child was born.

[169] K.C. had always been underweight and had difficulty eating and gaining weight. J.G. expressed his concerns about this to K.C.'s sister and attempted strategies to

assist her in gaining weight while she was pregnant, including having her plate her own food, which did seem to have some success. He also asked her to speak to his mother, as she had considerable knowledge and experience in the area of nutrition.

[170] J.G. denies forcing K.C. to forego pre-natal vitamins due to their expense. He says that on the occasion when K.C. wanted to buy some, he reminded her that in fact, they had pre-natal vitamins at home already and they needed to use their limited funds to purchase dog food for her dog.

[171] When they returned to B.C. for a medical appointment in January 2024, they learned that K.C. had two cervixes, which complicated the pregnancy. During their meeting with the doctor, they were told that one option was abortion, and another option was for K.C. to come to B.C. for the last stage of the pregnancy and childbirth. K.C. chose the latter.

[172] After K.C. flew to B.C. in mid-February, J.G. said that he spoke to K.C. daily. Their relationship grew somewhat strained during that time and they sometimes had arguments. He said one argument related to their respective dogs getting in fights with one another, and another related to a dispute over whose last name their child would carry. As noted, the latter dispute was resolved by an agreement that their child would have a hyphenated surname.

[173] J.G. said that he had intended to be present for the birth, but that K.C. went into labour a month early. As soon as he learned that, he was able to fly down, arriving the next day on [omitted for publication].

[174] J.G. gave emotional testimony about arriving at the hospital and seeing L. for the first time while he was laying on K.C.'s lap. He asked if he could hold him and then removed his shirt so that he could have skin to skin contact. He said that it was the most special thing he has ever experienced. He stayed in the hospital with K.C. and L. for three days. He said he had wanted to stay longer, but was aware that once K.C. was discharged from the hospital, he was not welcome to stay at A.W. and E.W.'s home.

[175] J.G. denies becoming angry with K.C. while they were both at the hospital. He did become frustrated with her when she insisted on moving around, as she had been told by medical staff that she needed to rest. He says that on one occasion, K.C. was leaking from her right breast. He placed a towel on top of it, and denies that he was acting in any sexual manner. He says that he has no idea why a hospital record notation states that he was not supportive and was abusive. He believes that must have come from something K.C. had said.

[176] A.W. drove him to the airport to return to [omitted for publication]. During that drive, A.W. told J.G. that he should break up with K.C. J.G. said he would not, but would like to participate in counselling with her. He said that he found that conversation to be quite upsetting, given that he and K.C. had just had a child together.

[177] When he returned to [omitted for publication], he and K.C. were still in a relationship and planned to live together as a family of three when she returned home. They had gathered a crib, bassinet, toys, diapers, feeding utensils and more, in anticipation of that plan. However, two days after he returned to [omitted for publication], K.C. phoned him and broke up with him. He said he was devastated by this.

[178] A day or so later, A.W. sent him a text message in which he said that K.C. had told him that she no longer wanted to be continuing a personal relationship with him. J.G. was advised that this was dictated by K.C. and sent at her request. J.G. felt that she had been manipulated into making this decision, particularly in light of the fact that just days earlier, A.W. had told him that he should break up with her.

[179] Following their break up, all communication between J.G. and K.C. was required to be on the larger group chat. However, after a month or so, K.C. reached out to him directly on Facebook and they began regularly communicating with one another on that platform, although K.C. asked that he not let on to A.W. and E.W. that they were communicating directly with one another.

[180] On May 21, K.C. sent him a message telling him that her counsellor wants her to put L. up for adoption with her family because of her disability. He responded by telling her that would not happen, and specifically wrote:

[K.C.], they can not take away [L.] from you or me.  And even if they did take him away, custody would go to me.  No one else, and if he goes to me you bet your ass your going to be in his life

- [181] While they continued to regularly communicate with one another later in May, K.C. did not reveal that in fact she and L. had returned to [omitted for publication], despite his specific questions about when they planned to return. Their communications clearly demonstrate that she was intentionally misleading him.
- [182] J.G. only learned on May 30 that they were back in [omitted for publication], when he received a message from E.W. advising of that fact and inviting him to the meeting the next day on May 31. When he attended that meeting, J.G. was told that K.C. and her family had decided that she was unable to care for L. on her own. He was also told that L. had a number of health issues, that he had not previously been aware of, and that he had an appointment to see an ENT specialist in July and that L. should come back to B.C. to address those health issues.
- [183] J.G. said that he became very emotional upon learning of this and was only given a few minutes to make a decision. He then reluctantly agreed to A.W. and E.W. taking L. back to B.C. to address his medical issues, but said that he made it clear that L. was to be returned after the ENT appointment. He testified that had he known earlier that L. was in [omitted for publication], he would have had time to take steps to arrange for medical resources to be put in place there instead, but he was not given an opportunity to do so.
- [184] After this meeting, J.G. asked for his brother and sister to be able to meet L. They did so and he was also given a paper to sign in which both he and K.C. gave consent to E.W. making medical decisions for L. Although the paper does not specifically state that it is to be temporary, J.G. says that it was very clear to everyone at that meeting that this was temporary. E.W. returned to B.C. with L. the next day.

[185] Following the departure of L. to B.C., J.G. arranged for Social Worker C.R. to attend at his home to make sure that it was suitable. As noted, she attended his home and had no concerns about its suitability for an infant to live there.

[186] On July 16, 2024, E.W. advised J.G. that L. had attended the appointment with the ENT specialist the day before. She advised that the appointment went very well and that the doctor at first queried why they were there. His breathing was fine and he was simply found to have a mild case of lanryngomalacia, or floppy larynx. This is not a serious condition and generally resolves by the time a child is 18 to 20 months old.

- [187] After learning of the positive appointment with the ENT specialist, J.G. began planning to come to B.C. to retrieve L. He advised A.W. and E.W. that he would be arriving in B.C. the following week and would be staying at his uncle and aunt's home in Surrey, until L. was able to come home.

[188] At that point J.G. and K.C. had been communicating regularly with one another by Facebook. Their communications were cordial, positive and at times, even affectionate. However, when J.G. advised her that he was planning to go to Surrey the following week, presumably to get L., K.C. stopped communicating. Then on July 24 she wrote to him, stating in part:

I told Auntie and Uncle to take care of [L.] and not to give [L.] to you because of your anger issues.  And for caring for [L.] needs as in food wise also hospital and school not be able to pay for what he needs in life wise I don't trust you for taking care of [L.] needs

- [189] In the same message, she also refers to him talking on the phone while driving, her being scared of him, and not wanting anything to do with him. She closes by telling him that she trusts her aunt and uncle to care for L. and is now going to block him.
- [190] J.G. arrived in B.C. on July 22 and asked E.W. if he would be able to pick up L. and bring him to stay with him at his aunt and uncle's home in Surrey. However, E.W. responded by saying that this request needs to go through the Ministry. J.G. contacted the Ministry and was advised that they were not involved. E.W. then advised that they were instructed by L.'s paediatricians to not allow L. to be moved out of their care until

satisfied that his improvement was stable. No documentation in support of that was provided to J.G.

[191] J.G. then asked if he could arrange to see L. E.W. said that he could attend his doctor's appointment to see him, but only on the condition that he not disrupt L.'s care and living arrangements. While these discussions were occurring, A.W. and E.W. filed an Application About a Family Law Matter on July 26, 2024, in which they sought to be appointed guardians and to terminate the guardianship of both parents.

[192] Before he became aware of A.W. and E.W.'s application, on July 29 J.G. filed his own Application About Priority Parenting Matter. Because E.W. refused to provide him with her address, J.G. had to seek an order for alternate service.

[193] When the matter first appeared in Court on J.G.'s Application About Priority Parenting Matter on August 13, J.G. was provided for the first time with a letter dated July 4, 2024 from L.'s former paediatrician, Dr. D.R. The presiding judge was also provided with a copy. In that letter, Dr. D.R. advocated for L. not to be returned to the care of his parents at that time. Her opinion was based on the fact that L. required close follow up for his medical needs by the medical team that was in place, and that he was waiting to see specialists that were not available in [omitted for publication]. As noted earlier, Dr. D.R. has not seen L. since June 18, 2024.

[194] At the conclusion of the hearing on August 13, 2024, the parties consented to an interim order that permitted J.G. to have supervised parenting time twice per week for two hours each time. E.W. and K.C. were also ordered to sign a release to allow J.G. to be able to contact L.'s medical treatment providers and requiring that he be given notice of any medical appointments. Since then, J.G. has attended most of L.'s medical appointments. E.W. has been diligent in advising him of the appointments.

[195] When his visits were initially supervised by A.W. and E.W., J.G. says that A.W. frequently insulted him. One example was his telling J.G. that he smells badly. J.G. says that he suffers from ulcerative colitis, and is unable to use deodorant. He says he has never confronted A.W. about such insults.

[196] J.G.'s view is that while L. is small for his age, he is otherwise medically thriving. That is based on his own observations, as well as what he has been told by his paediatrician and staff at the Child Development Centre. The family has been offered to undergo genetic testing for L. J.G. says that he agrees to participate in this and has completed the paperwork, but has not been able to get time off work to do the necessary bloodwork.

[197] J.G. has connected with the Child Development Centre in [omitted for publication] and advised them of his plans. He is on their waitlist for services. He says that L. will be expedited, as he is a First Nations child. E-mail communication between him and the Child Development Centre confirm that he has taken those steps. He has also arranged for day-care support if and when he needs it, and has arranged for a paediatrician for L.

[198] On February 14, 2025, the parties consented to an order increasing J.G.'s parenting time to seven hours each weekend from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM each weekend, alternating between Saturday and Sunday. Parenting times for J.G. begin with an exchange at Canadian Tire, when A.W. and E.W. give him an update on L., including such information as when and what he has eaten and when he last slept. If he has not eaten recently, J.G. takes him home to feed him. They then engage in activities such as play, singing and reading books. He then takes a long nap in the afternoon, after which he eats again. He says that L. is a happy child and always wakes up happy, although he may get cranky just before his nap.

[199] Since February 16, 2025, J.G. has kept a log of his visits with L. Those detail what they do and eat on each visit, and include a photograph from each visit, a song of the day and an Ojibway word of the day that he has taught to L.

[200] The logs include instances of J.G. discussing L.'s Métis and Indigenous heritage with him. J.G. provided considerable detail about his family history and the practice of his grandfather giving family members spirit names and spirit animals. He says that his Grandfather, who is a residential school survivor, is bereft that he has not been able to

meet L. and that L. has been taken away from his family, echoing the history of Indigenous children being taken from their families.

[201] J.G. has attended Métis celebrations twice since moving to [omitted for publication] in 2020. He has not yet taken L. to any Indigenous cultural events, as his time with L. has been very limited.

[202] J.G. currently lives in a two bedroom suite in [omitted for publication], along with a female roommate. He describes the suite as having a massive kitchen and living room. His bedroom contains a crib for L., as well as clothes, toys and other baby supplies. He says that the suite is baby proofed. He has also continued to pay rent on and maintain a home in [omitted for publication]. Photographs of that home show it to be clean, appropriately furnished, including a bedroom with a crib and toys.

[203] In April 2024, J.G. attempted to send money to K.C. or A.W. and E.W. to assist with L., but they rejected it. Once his supervised visits began, J.G. bought a stroller for A.W. and E.W. to use, as he felt that the jogging stroller they were using was not adequate. However, they would not accept it. He has purchased formula to give to A.W. and E.W.

[204] J.G. has taken two parenting courses. One is the Parenting After Separation course, which is a short course required of all parties involved in litigation involving children in the Provincial Court of B.C. In addition, he has taken a 12-hour online parenting course in April 2025.

[205] J.G. does not have a criminal record. His driving record consists of one ticket that he received when he drove without realizing that his vehicle insurance had expired. He claims that he is a safe driver and has his car regularly maintained.

[206] If J.G. is successful in having L. placed in his primary care, he intends to return to [omitted for publication] with him. He then plans to get him used to his new home and introduce him to his new doctor. His mother has offered to temporarily move in with him to help out. He has confirmed that L. has a spot available at a day-care for when he decides to return to work. He anticipates doing the same work that he is currently doing

in B.C., although he will be entitled to receive Employment Insurance until he finds employment.

[207] J.G. notes that he did not previously realize how compromised K.C. is by her disability. He says that while they were together, she was fairly independent and he thought that her disability was little more than a speech impediment. Despite the challenges posed by her disability, he intends to involve her in L.'s life as much as possible, provided she has suitable supports to assist her.

## Law

[208] Section 37 of the Family Law Act requires that any order that is made respecting guardianship, parenting arrangements or contact with a child must consider the best interests of the child only. It also provides direction as to what factors should be considered in assessing what may be in the best interests of a child. It states:

- 37  (1) In making an agreement or order under this Part respecting guardianship, parenting arrangements or contact with a child, the parties and the court must consider the best interests of the child only.
- (2)  To determine what is in the best interests of a child, all of the child's needs and circumstances must be considered, including the following:
- (a) the child's health and emotional well-being;
- (b) the child's views, unless it would be inappropriate to consider them;
- (c) the nature and strength of the relationships between the child and significant persons in the child's life;
- (d) the history of the child's care;
- (e) the child's need for stability, given the child's age and stage of development;
- (f)  the ability of each person who is a guardian or seeks guardianship of the child, or who has or seeks parental responsibilities, parenting time or contact with the child, to exercise the person's responsibilities;
- (g) the impact of any family violence on the child's safety, security or well-being, whether the family violence is directed toward the child or another family member;

- (h) whether the actions of a person responsible for family violence indicate that the person may be impaired in the person's ability to care for the child and meet the child's needs;
- (i)  the appropriateness of an arrangement that would require the child's guardians to cooperate on issues affecting the child, including whether requiring cooperation would increase any risks to the safety, security or well-being of the child or other family members;
- (j)  any civil or criminal proceeding relevant to the child's safety, security or well-being.
- (3)  An agreement or order is not in the best interests of a child unless it protects, to the greatest extent possible, the child's physical, psychological and emotional safety, security and well-being.
- (4)  In making an order under this Part, a court may consider a person's conduct only if it substantially affects a factor set out in subsection (2), and only to the extent that it affects that factor.

[209] Section 39 of the Family Law Act governs the determination of guardianship. It states:

- 39  (1) While a child's parents are living together and after the child's parents separate, each parent of the child is the child's guardian.
- (2)  Despite subsection (1), an agreement or order made after separation or when the parents are about to separate may provide that a parent is not the child's guardian.
- (3)  A parent who has never resided with the parent's child is not the child's guardian unless one of the following applies:
- (a) section 30 [parentage if other arrangement] applies and the person is a parent under that section;
- (b) the parent and all of the child's guardians make an agreement providing that the parent is also a guardian;
- (c) the parent regularly cares for the child.
- (4)  If a child's guardian and a person who is not the child's guardian marry or enter into a marriage-like relationship, the person does not become a guardian of that child by reason only of the marriage or marriage-like relationship.

[210] Only a guardian may have parental responsibilities and parenting time with respect to a child (s. 40). Any person who is not a guardian has no standing to seek parenting time with a child and may only seek contact with the child (ss. 58 and 59).

- [211] Section 51 of the FLA empowers a Court to appoint a person as a guardian, as well as to terminate a person's guardianship. It states in part:
2. 51 (1) On application, a court may
3. (a) appoint a person as a child's guardian, or
4. (b) except in the case of a director who is a child's guardian under the Adoption Act or the Child, Family and Community Service Act , terminate a person's guardianship of a child.

[212] Since L. is Indigenous, through both his mother's and his father's sides of the family, an assessment of his best interests includes the factors set out in the Federal legislation called An Act Respecting First Nations, Inuit and Métis children, youth and families . Sub-section 10(3) of that Act states in part:

- (3) To determine the best interests of an Indigenous child, all factors related to the circumstances of the child must be considered, including
2. (a)  the child's cultural, linguistic, religious and spiritual upbringing and heritage;

………..

- (d) the importance to the child of preserving the child's cultural identity and connections to the language and territory of the Indigenous group, community or people to which the child belongs;

…………

- (f) any plans for the child's care, including care in accordance with the customs or traditions of the Indigenous group, community or people to which the child belongs;

…………

[213] The parties rely on a number of cases in support of their respective positions. While I have considered them all, I do not intend to refer to all of them in this decision. I will however, summarize some of the important principles that come from several of them.

[214] In A.A.A.M. v. British Columbia (Children and Family Development) , 2015 BCCA 220, a biological father sought to be appointed as a guardian of his child. The mother of the child had signed a consent to adoption of the child making the Director of Adoption

the guardian of the child. The father obtained an order for interim access to the child while the child was placed with an adoptive family pending a final adoption order. Access was limited to 1½ hours each month. The Director of Adoption actively opposed any increase in access and then argued at the trial that s. 39(3)(c) of the FLA could not apply as the father did not 'regularly care for the child'. The trial judge agreed with that submission and denied his application for guardianship.

[215] On appeal, the B.C. Court of Appeal overturned the trial judge on the issue of guardianship under s. 39(3)(c). The Court of Appeal stated that the trial judge failed to consider the fact that the father had done all that he reasonably could have in the circumstances and that the reason for his minimal contact with the child was owing to the actions of the ministry workers, the Director, and the Court, who controlled how often and how long he was permitted to have contact with his child.

[216] In arriving at its conclusion, the Court of Appeal also noted the distinction between s. 39, and the appointment of persons as guardians under s. 51. With respect to the latter, an applicant must satisfy the Court that such an order is in the best interests of the child, while a parent who is a guardian under s. 39 is not required to do so.

[217] In M.A.B. v. J.A.B. , 2023 BCSC 1276, the Court found that there is a low threshold for regularly caring for a child under s. 39(3)(c). The question to be considered is whether the applicant parent has shown a willingness to provide for the child's ongoing needs 'usually' or 'normally', that is, more than simply visiting the child at regular intervals.

[218] In B.J.T. v. J.D., 2022 SCC 24, the Supreme Court of Canada addressed a custody dispute under Prince Edward Island's child protection legislation. The dispute was between the maternal grandmother, who had been the child's primary caregiver, and the child's father, who sought custody of the child after learning of his existence following his removal from the mother by child protection authorities. The Court stated that while it is not an error for a Court to consider a biological tie in itself in evaluating a child's best interests, a biological tie should generally carry minimal weight in the

assessment. A parent's biological tie is simply one factor among many that may be relevant to a child's best interests. Judges should not treat biology as a tie-breaker when two prospective custodial parents are otherwise equal. Placing too great an emphasis on a biological tie may distract from the central principle of the child's best interests.

[219] In A.L. &amp; J.L. v. D.K. &amp; M.W. , 2000 BCCA 455, the B.C. Court of Appeal stated that while a biological connection is not determinative, it is entitled to consideration when assessing competing claims between a parent and a non-parent. At paragraph 25, the Court said:

Otherwise, any relative who had a better environment in which to raise a child and who might even be a better parent, could start on an equal footing in a custody contest with a parent who has entrusted the child temporarily to his or her care. Surely this cannot be correct: parents are entitled to raise their children unless there is a clear reason why they cannot do so or unless they clearly agree otherwise.  As noted in a 1994 case, Seymour v. Seymour , [1994] B.C.J. No. 1970 by Master Bolton:

Counsel for the plaintiffs agreed that this application is not a level playing field where anybody who expresses an interest in children can come to court and say, "We can provide a better home than somebody else."  Other things being equal, children belong with one or both of their parents, and unless there are grave reasons for concern about the well-being of the children with both of their parents, not even grandparents have a right to interfere.

[220] Counsel for J.G. referred to a number of cases in which the Courts have stated that termination of a person's guardianship is considered extreme and will be granted only in rare and clear cases where it is clearly in a child's best interests: Lessard v. Mahoney , 2019 BCSC 551; D. v. D. , 2013 BCPC 135; M.A.G. v. P.L.M. , 2014 BCSC 126.

[221] In R.S. v. C.S.S. and D.S. , 2024 BCPC 110, the Court was asked to choose between a biological mother and the child's caregivers. The mother had a history of addiction and had placed the child with her brother and his wife immediately after he was born, in order to avoid the child being apprehended by child protection authorities. The child remained with the caregivers, with the mother having little contact with him.

Eventually the mother addressed her addiction issues and sought to have the child returned to her care. All of the parties were Indigenous. The parties had consented to an order that they were all guardians. The dispute was with whom the child would reside. In determining that the child should be parented by his mother, Judge Cronin said the following:

- [38] In this case, I accept it is important for the child to have a familial bond with his Mother and his siblings, particularly M. The child is entitled to have the opportunity to create a bond with his brother and his other siblings. While it is clear the Mother was unable to care for the child when he was born, she has taken significant steps to change her life, so she is now able to meet his needs. The child's psychological and emotional safety and security needs can be met in his Mother's care, allowing for him to bond with her and M. A child's bond with their biological parent is a relevant factor in determining the best interests of a child if that parent can meet the needs of the child's health and emotional well-being. The child only has one Mother. He is entitled to have the opportunity to have a meaningful bond with her, in order to address his health and emotional well-being.

…

- [62] It is time for the Mother to step in and take responsibility as the child's parent now that she is able to do so. He deserves to have the opportunity to be parented by the Mother. He need not feel abandoned by her, despite her being unable to care for him when he was born. He will be three years old in [omitted for publication]. It is in his best interests for the Mother to build a foundation for a strong and caring relationship with him as soon as possible. This means she needs to care for him and parent him.
- [222] In a similar case of P.G.W. v. P.F.W. and C.V.R. , 2017 BCPC 36, the Court was asked to determine a parenting dispute between the maternal grandmother and the children's father. The children had been in the care of the grandmother for 18 months due to the mother's substance abuse and mental health issues. The mother supported the grandmother's application to be appointed as a guardian. The grandmother and the children resided in British Columbia and the father resided in Alberta. The grandmother had provided excellent care to the children and the father had largely been absent from their lives but had recently demonstrated a willingness and ability to assume parental responsibilities. The Court concluded that the children should be in the father's care,

despite the exemplary care that the grandmother had provided and that the time had come for her to be their grandmother and to allow the father to be their primary caregiver.

[223] In D.B. v. B.B. , 2017 BCPC 359, the mother had given birth to a child when she was 15 years old. After the child's birth, she was cared for by the mother, the maternal grandmother and aunts, but had primarily been in the care of the grandmother for the past year. The grandmother had been appointed an interim guardian and sought to continue that by way of a final order. The mother sought to have the child in her care. Ultimately, the Court concluded that the now three-year-old child should be with her mother. In arriving at that conclusion, Judge Chettiar said at paragraph 87:

[87] The analysis in these types of cases should not be focused on who is a better guardian: the parent or the grandparent.  It should not be a competition between the parent and the grandparent.  In many cases, the grandparents may be in a better position in terms of their age, experience and resources (financial and otherwise) to provide a better home for the child, but that may not necessarily be in the best interest of the child.  If after engaging in the child's best interests' analysis, including considering the factors in s. 37(2) of the FLA , the court determines that both the parent and the grandparent meet the 'best interests of the child' test, then the parent should be given preference over the grandparent to be a guardian of the child.  This does not mean that one is better or worse than the other.  I doubt that any parent is a perfect parent.  As the saying goes, being a parent is one of the hardest jobs one faces in life.

## Analysis

## Credibility

[224] The credibility of the various witnesses is a factor in my decision. The central witnesses were the parties themselves.

[225] I found the testimony of both E.W. and A.W. suffered from their very clear animus towards J.G. It was apparent that from a very early stage, they had decided that they did not like J.G., despite their minimal interaction with him. Their antipathy towards him was evident throughout their testimony. That could be seen in their references to trivial

matters that they saw as transgressions, such as J.G. talking too loudly, not offering to contribute to a restaurant bill and not helping K.C. with her backpack.

[226] Both of A.W. and E.W.'s testimony carried an air of condescension towards J.G., something that carried through in A.W.'s personal interactions with J.G. When he was asked, A.W. was unable to come up with anything positive about J.G., although he did give him credit for remaining calm and focused on L. when A.W. criticises or insults him. His assertion that J.G. lies all the time was not supported by the evidence.

[227] Furthermore, in cross-examination, E.W. admitted to lying at the meeting at the social worker's office on May 31, 2024 about her intentions regarding returning L. She asserted at that meeting that L. would be going to B.C. temporarily to address his health issues. She admitted in cross-examination that she used that deception to her advantage. Remarkably, when J.G.'s mother expressed a concern about L. not being returned to [omitted for publication], E.W. responded by reassuringly saying, 'I have integrity'. Given that very central deception, I have concerns about E.W.'s evidence more generally. Furthermore, I also note that she sometimes became defensive, irritated and even angry while testifying. She became angry when the issue of J.G.'s Métis heritage was raised, without being asked stating 'all this touting about deep aboriginal roots is completely offensive'.

[228] On the whole I found K.C.'s evidence to be credible. However, it also appeared to me that she may be easily swayed by those around her. Many of her answers were comprised of generalities without much detail to back up her assertions. For example, after testifying about J.G.'s lies, K.C. was unable to articulate much more than that he had lied to their landlord about how many pets they had, something that J.G. acknowledged and apologized for in Court.

[229] It appeared that K.C.'s alignment with the position of A.W. and E.W. in this litigation coloured aspects of her evidence. After terminating contact with J.G. other than through a group chat, K.C. reinitiated ongoing contact with him directly, but did so secretly to avoid the disapproval of A.W. and E.W. Moreover, despite her assertions of being so fearful of J.G. that she did not feel comfortable having any contact with him,

the text exchanges between them after their break up were affectionate and even suggestive of intimacy between them.

[230] I expect that some of the deficiencies in K.C.'s evidence are attributable to her disability. The Report of Psychological Assessment for Incapacity notes that due to her genetic disorder, her memory is impaired and she has a tendency to mix information up, or to confabulate information from different sources in her longer-term recall. The report also notes that she has a marked impairment in her ability to comprehend or understand the relevant information and implications in a given situation. The report also notes that K.C. describes being abused by her partner and that the abuse was continuing until very recently. This is noteworthy as at the time of the report, K.C. had not had any in person contact with J.G. since four days after L. was born, which was several months earlier.

[231] J.G.'s evidence was generally credible and reliable. He was generally detailed in his description of events and his evidence was largely consistent with the other witnesses that testified in his case. Despite the efforts A.W. and E.W. have taken to keep L. from him and minimize his time with L., J.G. demonstrated a remarkable lack of animus towards them, instead showing an appreciation for the meticulous care they have provided to L.

## Best Interests of the Child Factors

[232] I will next turn to a consideration of the circumstances set out in s. 37(2) of the Family Law Act to assess the best interests of a child.

## (a) the child's health and emotional well-being:

[233] The evidence suggests that L.'s physical health is good. There were clearly a number of health concerns present when L. was very young. He was born prematurely and following a high risk pregnancy. He had a low birth weight of five lbs, 11 oz., and as is common with new-borns, initially lost some of that weight. In the following weeks, his well-being was monitored by a medical team that included Dr. D.R.

[234] Dr. B. began seeing L. in June 2024 and continues to see him. Although she did not testify, medical records from Dr. B. were in evidence. Those records show that L. initially presented with concerns regarding difficulty with gaining weight. Records from Dr. B. show a continued weight gain, although by the last report in November 2024, he remained below the third percentile in his weight. The progress note from October 2024 noted that while a lot of lab work is pending, blood work received to date is not abnormal or concerning. While counsel pointed out several aspects from L.'s bloodwork that were outside the reference range, without expert evidence I am unable to attach any significance to those, particularly in light of Dr. B.'s comment about lab work results being normal, as well as the fact that those results are from several months ago.

[235] There was no medical evidence before the Court more recent than November 2024. There was however, the testimony of the parties. E.W. said that L. remains a small child, although he has gained considerable weight. He continues to be under the care of the Child Development Centre and has regular visits there, as well as consultations with paediatric dieticians. Both E.W. and J.G. testified that L. is doing well and J.G. says that he has been told by Dr. B. and the CDC staff that he is 'thriving'. Dr. B. has suggested that genetic testing be completed to determine if there are any genetic concerns or a genetic basis for L.'s small size. J.G. says that he intends to do the lab work necessary to complete that testing, but has not been able to yet due to his work schedule. On the whole, L. does not appear to currently have any significant health issues.

## (b) the child's views, unless it would be inappropriate to consider them:

[236] Given L.'s age, this factor is not applicable.

## (c) the nature and strength of the relationships between the child and significant persons in the child's life:

[237] Clearly, L. has a strong relationship with E.W. and A.W. due to them being his primary caregivers since June 2024. Although there was no specific evidence on this point, it is safe to infer that his connection with K.C. is modest, given that over the past year they have only had in person contact when she has come to B.C. for this trial.

Given L.'s young age, that would likely make their relationship somewhat tenuous. That said, clearly K.C. loves L. and wishes to have an ongoing role in his life, notwithstanding her support for A.W. and E.W.'s application which is to keep him in British Columbia.

[238] Although J.G. effectively had no contact with L. between May 31, 2024 and August 15, 2024, since then he has had regular contact with L., beginning slowly but increasing over time. J.G.'s evidence, supported by his mother L.H. and C.E. and S.E., indicate that he has developed a close bond with L. and that L. enjoys time with his father. Other potentially significant persons in L.'s life are his grandmother (L.H.), his aunt and cousins (J.G.'s sister and her children), and his maternal aunt and her family (K.C.'s sister, husband and children). All of those individuals live in [omitted for publication].

[239] Another feature of this case is that if J.G. is successful in this trial, he intends to invite K.C. to have a regular and active role in L.'s life. While A.W. and E.W. have proposed permitting K.C. four visits per year, the reality is that L. has not been to [omitted for publication] since May 2024 and it is far more likely that K.C. would remain only peripherally involved in his life if L. remains in B.C. with A.W. and E.W.

## (d) the history of the child's care:

[240] With the exception of the first two months of his life, L. has been in the primary, and for the most part, sole care of A.W. and E.W. However, while that was initially with the consent of J.G. and for a temporary period only, that consent was based on a deception from E.W., that it was necessary for medical reasons. By late July 2024, J.G. had made it clear to A.W. and E.W. that he was no longer consenting to their continued care of L. and wanted him placed in his care. While L. has remained in their primary care since then, J.G. has been pro-active in taking every step available to him to have L. placed in his care.

## (e) the child's need for stability, given the child's age and stage of development:

[241] L.'s need for stability relates to both his residence and his routine. While continuing to reside with A.W. and E.W. would reduce short term disruptions in his life,

he is nonetheless used to having regular time with his father who is certainly no stranger to him. Moreover, both A.W. and E.W. and J.G. have demonstrated an ability to adhere to a daily routine for L. The journals written by J.G. regarding his time with L. show that he not only maintains a consistent routine, but that he keeps close track of what occurs during the time L. is with him. J.G. has also made concrete plans to transition L.'s care to a Child Development Centre in [omitted for publication], thus reducing any instability that might arise from any transition to his home.

## (f) the ability of each person who is a guardian or seeks guardianship of the child, or who has or seeks parental responsibilities, parenting time or contact with the child, to exercise the person's responsibilities:

[242] Neither A.W., E.W. nor J.G. have had experience raising a child before L., although I accept that both E.W. and J.G. have had experience with children in the past through their own families and friends. It is also apparent that A.W. and E.W., and in particular E.W., have been diligent in seeking medical supports for L. and following up with those supports. J.G. has also been very engaged and involved in L.'s medical treatment and support since August 2024, attending all but two of L.'s appointments. He has also been diligent in seeking out and securing similar supports in [omitted for publication].

[243] Both A.W. and E.W. were frequently critical of J.G.'s ability to care for L. However, in my view, J.G. has taken steps to learn as much as he can about parenting and to place himself in a good position to be a parent to L. He has taken parenting courses, seeks input from E.W. and asks questions of medical professionals. He has also demonstrated that he is capable of placing any resentment towards A.W. and E.W. aside for the benefit of L., something that A.W. and E.W. have been less able to do.

[244] While I accept that A.W. and E.W. have been able to provide a safe home for L., I do not accept their assertions that J.G. is not a safe parent and would be unable to provide a safe home. While J.G. acknowledges that some of his past housing when he lived with K.C. was woefully inadequate, there is nothing to suggest that the housing that he currently has in [omitted for publication] is deficient in any way. Indeed, photographs of it show it to be well furnished and entirely appropriate for a young child.

The social worker, C.R., has conducted a home visit there and found it to be adequate. Similarly, his current temporary residence in [omitted for publication] appears to be appropriate, despite A.W. and E.W.'s speculative and unfounded assertions to the contrary.

## (g) the impact of any family violence on the child's safety, security or well-being, whether the family violence is directed toward the child or another family member:

[245] In my view, the evidence does not support there being any history of family violence. While K.C. has made some assertions of J.G. being abusive, she does not suggest that he has ever laid a hand on her. Moreover, while the two of them clearly had some arguments, the evidence falls very short of demonstrating even any verbal abuse. Indeed, as noted earlier, even after their separation, the tone of written communication between J.G. and K.C. was cordial and even affectionate. It was never threatening or even angry in tone. J.G. also denies other alleged instances of acting out in anger. Given the shortcomings in K.C.'s evidence, I see no reason to reject J.G.'s denials.

(h) whether the actions of a person responsible for family violence indicate that the person may be impaired in the person's ability to care for the child and meet the child's needs:

[246] As I have determined that there was no family violence present, this factor is not applicable.

(i) the appropriateness of an arrangement that would require the child's guardians to cooperate on issues affecting the child, including whether requiring cooperation would increase any risks to the safety, security or well-being of the child or other family members:

[247] A.W. and E.W. submit that J.G. is unfit to be a parent and should not be permitted any guardianship or parenting time. While E.W. has demonstrated an ability to share medical information with J.G., it is difficult under the circumstances of this case to see how she could cooperate in the longer term with J.G. as a guardian. A.W. and E.W. seek a schedule of four visits each year for K.C. While I do not doubt their genuine

intentions, the reality to date is that that has not been happening and it will be difficult for that to occur given the geographic distances.

[248] On the contrary, J.G. has consistently maintained that he wishes to involve K.C. in L.'s life as much as possible. There is no reason to suggest that would not occur if L. was placed in his care and moved to [omitted for publication].

[249] In addition to the best interests factors enumerated in s. 37(2), I am also required to consider circumstances in relation to L.'s Indigenous heritage and in particular, the importance of preserving his cultural identity.

[250] L. is Indigenous on both sides of his family: Métis through his father and from the [omitted for publication] through his mother. While L. has been in their care, A.W. and E.W. have taken him to an Aboriginal Centre a few times and have taken him to a powwow. At the time of the trial, J.G. had not taken L. to any cultural events, saying that his time with L. was too limited to permit him doing so. However, J.G. gave considerable and detailed evidence about his connection to his Métis roots and the importance of it to him. That connection and his intentions to foster those connections appeared genuine to me. Although E.W. suggested that it was not genuine because A.W. had only mentioned his Métis heritage once in passing before L. was born, I note that occurred as early as the second or third time they ever met. I expect that J.G. is likely to assiduously foster L.'s connection with his Indigenous heritage if L. lives with him.

## Conclusions

[251] Having considered all of the evidence, I do not accept that J.G. is unfit to be a parent as alleged by A.W. and E.W. and supported by K.C. It is clear that A.W. and E.W. formed a very negative view of J.G. following their first interaction with him, prior to K.C. becoming pregnant, and that they persisted in that view, while dismissing any evidence to the contrary. Their views were formed by very limited contact with J.G. and by what they were evidently told by K.C.

[252] When A.W. and E.W. learned that K.C. was pregnant they clearly contemplated that they might end up caring for L., as they immediately discussed such a possibility

between themselves. I do not believe that they formed any specific intentions at that point to assume his care, but merely recognized it was a possibility given what they knew of K.C.'s limitations.

[253] However, it was clear that while K.C. lived with them in the weeks before and after L.'s birth, they had concluded that she would be unable to care for L. on her own. E.W. testified that she hoped that K.C. would come to that conclusion on her own, which she eventually did, with the input from her counsellor, who had been arranged by E.W.

[254] When A.W. and E.W. accompanied K.C. and L. to [omitted for publication] in May, the purpose was ostensibly to assist K.C. in settling in there, connecting her to resources and assisting her in transitioning to care for L. That would suggest that L.'s medical issues were not so serious that he had to remain in B.C. However, while they were there, K.C. acknowledged that she could not care for L. and asked A.W. and E.W. to take over his care. They agreed to do so, not because of L.'s health issues, but rather because K.C. could not care for him and A.W. and E.W. believed that J.G. similarly could not.

[255] However, at the meeting on May 31, 2024, E.W. deceptively framed the purpose of taking L. back to B.C. as being so that he could address his medical issues. She knew that was not true and admitted that she used that reason in order to convince J.G. to agree. Indeed, in the days prior to that meeting, she had told a doctor that she and A.W. planned to adopt L. and hoped to take him back to B.C. with them that weekend. At that point, J.G. knew nothing of such a plan and did not even know that L. was in [omitted for publication].

[256] At the May 31 meeting, I find that it was clearly represented to J.G. that L. would be in B.C. only temporarily to address medical issues and in particular, to attend an appointment with an ENT specialist, and would return to [omitted for publication] after that. I do not accept E.W.'s assertion contained in her closing submissions that it was her intention to later return to [omitted for publication] with L. only to allow visitation between L. and J.G.'s family. E.W. did not testify to that, nor does such an assertion comport with the rest of the evidence.

[257] While both parents signed a hastily prepared e-mail, authorizing E.W. to have primary care and decision making, that was done at E.W.'s request and without legal advice. Moreover, given that the purported reason for L. returning to B.C. was for medical reasons, providing E.W. with such authorizations was entirely reasonable. It certainly is not evidence of J.G. consenting to anything more than that.

[258] It is noteworthy that just a month after they returned to B.C. with L., on July 4 A.W. and E.W. obtained a letter from Dr. D.R. strongly advocating for L. to remain in their care. That clearly indicates that they were beginning to lay the groundwork for their subsequent guardianship application.

[259] L. attended the appointment with the ENT specialist on July 16, 2024 and was found to not require any medical intervention. When J.G. learned of that, he made plans to come to B.C. to take L. home when he was ready. However, A.W. and E.W. would not allow it and would not even advise him of their address. They would not allow him to see L. unless he agreed with their assertion that L. would stay with them in accordance with 'doctor's orders', for which they provided no evidence. They then commenced these proceedings just days later on July 26, 2024 in which they sought to be appointed L.'s guardians, and to cancel guardianship of both parents. Remarkably, their Application contained the statement, '[J.G.] has not shown any indication that he would like to have [L.] in his life, for [L.'s] well-being and best interest.' On the contrary, the evidence demonstrates that J.G. has done everything he can to have L. in his life.

[260] When the matter initially proceeded to the first court appearance on August 13 (which came on as a result of the Application About Priority Parenting Matter filed by J.G.), A.W. and E.W. provided J.G., for the first time, and the Court with Dr. D.R.'s letter of July 4, in which she strongly advocated for L. to remain in the care of A.W. and E.W. due to his medical needs. By that time, Dr. D.R. had not been L.'s paediatrician for almost two months and had never met J.G. While that letter likely formed the basis for the interim order for very limited parenting for J.G., with respect to Dr. D.R., I cannot place any weight on that letter at this point. The letter refers to a very specific point in time when Dr. D.R. was involved, which was more than a year ago. Moreover, her letter

goes far beyond the bounds of simply offering a medical opinion and strays deeply into advocacy. In addition, she had never met J.G. and yet advocated for L. to be kept out of his care.

[261] Since J.G.'s visits began last August, A.W. and E.W. have been relentlessly critical of him. They complain that he has body odour, he talks too much, his vehicle is unsafe due to having the rear window sealed shut, he walks with his shoes untied while carrying L., he does not keep track of medical information during appointments, he might be driving without wearing his prescription glasses, he uses an improper high chair, is over-reliant on pre-prepared baby foods, and has returned L. with a heat rash. Their determination to find fault with J.G. even led them to hire private investigators to follow him. The worst that could be revealed by the private investigators was that on one occasion J.G. may have sped while L. was in the car with him and that there were several cars parked outside his residence on one occasion, which may or may not have been associated with his residence. While A.W. testified that J.G. lives in a 'tear down house' in [omitted for publication] according to the private investigator, there was no evidence whatsoever to support that assertion. Nor can I accept A.W.'s testimony that J.G. 'lies about everything'.

[262] J.G. is far from perfect and I expect he will not be a perfect parent. In the past, he has struggled with financial instability. He and K.C. also resided in at least one home that would not be fit for a child. When they moved to their second home together, their dogs were ill and frequently defecated inside the home. Again, that may not have been an appropriate home for a child. However, the last home that they shared together and the one that J.G. currently rents in [omitted for publication] seems entirely appropriate, as confirmed by the social worker, C.R. The mice problem that was originally an issue has been addressed. Similarly, his temporary residence in B.C. also seems to be appropriate.

[263] J.G. has been consistently employed since arriving in B.C. and has plans to obtain employment in [omitted for publication]. While he has not yet sought any employment there, that is understandable given the uncertainty related to this litigation.

Nonetheless, he has job skills that would likely be transferable to employment elsewhere. He has been pro-active in securing medical care in [omitted for publication], as well as day-care when he eventually needs it. There is no evidence that at this point any medical resources L. might require will not be available to him in [omitted for publication]. While I question whether he has been sufficiently diligent in obtaining lab work to assist the proposed genetic testing for L., there is otherwise no evidence that he has not followed through with any and all medical recommendations.

[264] J.G. has the support of family members in [omitted for publication], and in particular his mother and sister. He has taken a parenting course. He also has a clear plan and motivation to engage in cultural resources connecting L. with his Indigeneity, both through his family members and within the larger community. While A.W. and E.W. have done a good job in exposing L. to Indigenous culture, in my view that is not equivalent to the more immersive exposure through family members that J.G. intends. The objective of preserving L.'s cultural identity and connecting to same favours him being with J.G. I also find that J.G. genuinely intends to include K.C. in L.'s life and that he is in a position to meaningfully do so if L. resides with him in [omitted for publication].

[265] In all of the circumstances, I find that J.G. is a parent who has regularly cared for L. in accordance with ss. 39(3)(c) of the FLA . As in A.A.A.M. , any limitations on his contact with L. have only been a result of the resistance of A.W. and E.W. and orders of the Court, and not through any lack of diligence on his part. Moreover, the time he has spent with L. has involved substantive parenting and certainly goes beyond simply visiting L. at regular intervals as referred to in M.A.B. Accordingly, I find that J.G. is a presumptive guardian under ss. 39(3)(c). I need not consider whether such a finding is in L.'s best interests ( A.A.A.M. ), but if it were necessary, I conclude that such a finding is in L.'s best interests.

[266] I also find that L. should be in the primary care of J.G. While being a parent of L. does not trump all other factors, it is a significant factor in the assessment of L.'s best interests. As in the cases above of R.S., P.G.W. and D.B. , the time has come for L. to

be parented by his father. Accordingly, there will be an order that L. primarily reside with him.

[267] K.C. seeks to continue being a guardian. None of the parties oppose that. Indeed, as noted in the cases referred to above, cancellation of guardianship is an extreme measure. As such, I will not interfere with K.C.'s status as a guardian. However, her cognitive limitations associated with her disability justify J.G. having all of the parental responsibilities.

[268] This decision will have a dramatic impact on the arrangements that have been in place for effectively all of L.'s life. As such, a transition period will be appropriate. Unfortunately, given the zero sum positions of the parties, I have not received any submissions on what a proper transition period might look like. As such, the transition period that I will impose will initially increase J.G.'s parenting time to include the full weekends from Friday at 6:00 PM until Sunday at 6:00 PM, as well as a continuation of Tuesdays from 5:30 to 8:00 PM. That schedule will remain in place until August 22, 2025. On August 22, 2025, J.G. will begin having primary residence of L. and will be at liberty to return to [omitted for publication] with him.

[269] After J.G. assumes primary care of L., I would hope that A.W. and E.W. will continue to have contact with L. However, given the history, that will have to be worked out between them by agreement and I am not prepared to impose any schedule at this point. As such, there will be an order that A.W. and E.W. have contact time with L. at dates and times agreed upon between J.G. and A.W. and E.W.

[270] I decline to make an order appointing A.W. and E.W. as guardians under s. 51(1)(a) of the FLA . Given the outcome of this trial, such an order would be contrary to L.'s best interests, as it would require J.G. and A.W. and E.W. to cooperate with one another.

[271] K.C. will have parenting time with L. at dates and times as agreed upon between her and J.G. Such parenting time may be supervised.
