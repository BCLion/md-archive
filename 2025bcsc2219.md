## Introduction

- [1] This family law action primarily concerns the parties' daughter, T., who is 15 years of age and in grade 10.
- [2] T. is the only shared biological child of the parties.
- [3] T. has a documented history of difficulties with anxiety but is otherwise a healthy child with no special needs. She does well in school and participates quite extensively in one competitive sport at the present time.
- [4] In an application filed October 3, 2025 (the 'Child Lawyer Application'), Ms. Jenab applies on behalf of T. for an order pursuant to s. 203 of the Family Law Act, S.B.C. 2011, c. 25 [ FLA ] that she be appointed as counsel for T.
- [5] There are various other ancillary orders sought which would allow counsel for T. to have the full power to act for T. as though they are a party to these proceedings. These ancillary orders are included in Appendix 'A' to these reasons for judgment.
- [6] During oral submissions Ms. Jenab advised that if the Court was inclined to grant the primary relief sought but took issue with the fact that Ms. Jenab has already met with T. another lawyer through the Child and Youth Legal Center could be appointed on the same ancillary terms (or such terms as otherwise modified by the Court). Ms. Jenab does, however, have significant experience in this area of law and is the current chair of the BC Hear the Child Society.

[7] The claimant, T.'s mother, is opposed to the Child Lawyer Application. The claimant believes that the statutory requirements for the appointment of a lawyer under s. 203 of the FLA are not satisfied. She further submits that allowing T. to have her own counsel would over empower her and is, for various reasons, not in T.'s best interests. The claimant favours a judicial interview.

- [8] The respondent, T.'s father, consents to the Child Lawyer Application.

- [9] The respondent paid the retainer to allow Ms. Jenab to bring the Child Lawyer Application but expressly denies having any other involvement with the Child Lawyer Application. He further denies that it is being funded by him for an improper purpose as suggested by the claimant. The respondent is not opposed to a judicial interview provided it would be in conjunction with allowing T. to have her own counsel.
- [10] Time is of the essence in deciding the Child Lawyer Application as the trial is scheduled to commence on November 17, 2025. It is presently set for 15 days but the expectation, based on the current witness lists, is that 10 to 15 additional days will likely be required in the new year.
- [11] Ms. Jenab advised the Court that if the Court grants the Order that T. be appointed counsel, it is not anticipated that there would be any request for an adjournment. Ms. Jenab is available for the trial as presently scheduled.

## Background

- [12] The parties separated in May of 2015 when T. was approximately five and one-half years of age.
- [13] From the time of separation until T. was 12 years of age there was a shared parenting arrangement in place between the parties by agreement.
- [14] Thereafter, for a period of approximately two years between the time T. was 12 and 14 years of age, T. was completely estranged from the claimant. This period of estrangement lasted from on or about October 5, 2022 to on or about November 5, 2024. The parties have very different views on the reasons for the estrangement. There are allegations of alienation by the claimant and allegations of parenting conduct by the respondent which he asserts resulted in T. justifiably rejecting the claimant. None of these allegations have, of course, been proven yet.
- [15] On June 28, 2023, which was roughly in the middle of the period of estrangement, the respondent sought and obtained a without notice protection order that prevented the claimant from any contact with T. (the 'Protection Order'). Part of

the evidence relied upon to obtain the Protection Order was an informal report dated June 21, 2023 from T.'s then counsellor, Traci Mainstone, at the request of and with input from the respondent (the 'Informal Report').

- [16] That Informal Report, amongst other statements, proffers Ms. Mainstone's opinion that the 'relationship between [T.] and her mother is harmful to [T.]'s mental and emotional health and forcing contact will very likely prove detrimental'. It then goes on to indirectly opine that T.'s relationship with the claimant was 'beyond repair'.
- [17] The Protection Order was terminated on August 23, 2023 by Mr. Justice Hori. At or about the same time, the order was made for the preparation of a s. 211 assessment by Robert Colby.
- [18] In October of 2024, the matter was previously set for trial. I was assigned as the trial judge shortly before, in September of 2024.
- [19] On the eve of the trial, counsel for the claimant and former counsel for the respondent negotiated a very comprehensive interim consent order (the 'Interim Consent Order'). The Interim Consent Order, which is some 12 pages in length, involved, inter alia , the parties agreeing to engage with a family reconciliation therapy team (the 'RTT'), implementing a progressive parenting time schedule for T. and my agreeing to close judicial oversight of this proceeding as the ongoing case management justice.
- [20] Part of that case management involved me meeting with T. Not for the conventional purpose of a judicial interview with T. to ascertain her views, but rather the meeting was to explain, in age-appropriate terms and language, what was contemplated by the Interim Consent Order, the responsibilities of her parents under that order, T.'s involvement in the process, and my judicial oversight role.
- [21] For reference, many of the key terms of the Interim Consent Order are set out in one of my prior reasons for judgment in this proceeding, 'Reasons for Judgment Re: Electronic Communications' indexed at 2025 BCSC 1733: see paras. 40-42. These

paragraphs and the level of detail contained therein provide some key context as to the circumstances in play leading up to the October 2024 trial.

[22] Despite the Interim Consent Order, the path forward for this former family unit has not been without challenges.

[23] Ultimately, however, with the significant assistance of the RTT, led by Ms. Blancher and Ms. Lupichuk of Incentive Counselling, T. returned to a shared parenting arrangement in early April 2025. It is a week-on/week-off schedule.

[24] The RTT's role in implementing the systemic family reunification therapy ('SFRT') officially ended on or about June 16, 2025 when Ms. Blancher issued her final report. However, the parties continue to receive post-reunification support from Ms. Blancher, as does T.

[25] The reunification process between T. and the claimant remains fragile, but there has generally been compliance with the Interim Consent Order and some important shared moments between T. and the claimant have occurred that were simply not possible during the period of extended estrangement.

## Expert Reports

[26] I am aware from a review of the trial management conference briefs and discussions at the recent trial management conference that there are a variety of expert reports that parties intend to tender at trial.

[27] One of those reports is the jointly commissioned s. 211 assessment authored by Robert Colby dated February 28, 2024. I have not, to date, had occasion to read this report as, to my knowledge, it is not appended to any of the various affidavits which have been relied upon. If it is appended, it was never brought to my attention. The s. 211 assessment was prepared for the purposes of the October 2024 trial and thus predates any of the work done by the RTT. I am advised that the claimant has delivered notice in accordance with the Supreme Court Family Rules [ Rules ] that she will be objecting to the s. 211 assessment going into evidence. Although I anticipate I will hear

more on this at trial, I understand part of the objection to the report is that the Interim Consent Order constitutes a 'sea change' in the landscape and the report is now stale dated.

[28] In July 2025, the respondent filed an application that Robert Colby prepare an updated s. 211 assessment. The claimant opposed that application. Technically that application remains 'on the books', but the respondent has not elected to reset it for hearing (it was part of a handful of applications set to be heard over three days in August 2025 but there was insufficient time) after the decision was made to retain Ms. Jenab to bring the Child Lawyer Application.

[29] The decision of the respondent to 'shelve' the application for an updated s. 211 assessment followed receipt of a letter dated July 15, 2025 to both the claimant and the respondent from a Ms. Debuck of the Child and Youth Legal Centre. In that correspondence, Ms. Debuck advised that she had met with T. twice and after explaining possible ways for T.'s views to be heard in court, reported that T. wanted her own lawyer or, alternatively, an updated s. 211 assessment to be prepared by Robert Colby. T. did not indicate a preference for a judicial interview, although that was presented as an option by Ms. Debuck.

[30] There is also a prior views of the child report prepared by Brenda Forrester dated May 1, 2023 (which predates the commencement of this family law action on June 1, 2023). The claimant has also given notice under the Rules that she will be objecting to the admissibility of this report at trial. It is my understanding that this report was obtained by the respondent on his own initiative and then relied upon by the respondent for the purposes of obtaining the Protection Order. I have not reviewed this report.

[31] The members of the RTT who were involved with the family unit have tendered several reports since being engaged pursuant to the Interim Consent Order, including the final report dated June 16, 2025 authored by Ms. Blancher. I have had the benefit of reviewing these reports because, unlike the above reports which may or may not be admissible for trial, the provision of the RTT reports was an integral part of my judicial oversight/case management role under the Interim Consent Order.

[32] These reports speak to, inter alia , resistance T. had to the SFRT, certain behaviours of T., and various challenges generally faced during the reunification process. The reports, to use my own description, called out both parties for their conduct that was sometimes unhelpful and, on occasion, counterproductive to the goals of the SFRT. A particular theme in the reports is moving beyond past false narratives and presenting a united front in parenting T.

[33] Ms. Blancher, who remains actively involved with the post-reunification work, found out about the Child Lawyer Application through her role in the weekly reporting emails required of each parent. Ms. Blancher has indicated she does not support the Child Lawyer Application. In an email dated October 7, 2025, directed to both parties, Ms. Blancher states as follows:

This is very concerning. I have not received information that [T.] has obtained a lawyer. Is this true [E]? I would assume that lawyer services are not free and if a lawyer for [T.] is being financially supported by either parent, it would definitely be a problem. To return to our parenting program, a child is not emotionally or intellectually mature enough to make any decisions regarding spending time with a parent. A lawyer's involvement is putting us back to square one as a 3rd party professional is validating [T.'s] false narrative.

[34] In an email sent the following day addressing several topics, Ms. Blancher reiterated her position that she recommended strongly against T. having counsel appointed:

As mentioned in my previous email, it is inappropriate for [T.] to retain a lawyer and have any input in court proceedings. This most definitely puts her in the middle of your dispute and contradicts everything you have learned in the co-parenting program. Children who are put in the middle experience a loyalty bind and are forced to choose one parent over the other. This leads to a myriad of emotional and psychological difficulties, not to mention the validation of any false narratives such has been experienced in the past [emphasis added].

[35] In her oral submissions, and following my discussion with counsel for the respondent on this portion of the evidentiary record, Ms. Zenab suggested that Ms. Blancher is perhaps not fully appreciating what the role of counsel for T. would be if appointed under s. 203 of the FLA . Using the otherwise perhaps trite example of 'the bus' -Ms. Zenab submitted that appointing a lawyer for T. would not be tantamount to

allowing T., as a child, to 'drive the bus'. Rather, the role of counsel, Ms. Zenab described, is to simply 'explain to T. the route the bus is taking and the stops it is making along the way'. I have made specific reference to this portion of Ms. Zenab's submissions because I personally found it quite helpful.

## Parties' Anticipated Positions on Parenting Time at Trial

[36] I recognize that positions can evolve in the leadup to trial, particularly in a case like this where the final round of discoveries was only completed on October 30, 2025. However, according to the parties' respective trial management conference briefs, their positions on prospective parenting differ significantly. Specifically, their current positions regarding prospective parenting of T. can be summarized as set out below.

## [37] The claimant seeks orders that:

- a)  T. and the claimant participate in the Family Bridges program or such similar intensive reunification therapy program. During this time, and for a period of not less than 90 days, T. will have no contact with the respondent and his family to ensure that the relationship between the claimant and T. can be re-established without interference. During this time, the claimant will have sole decision-making authority for T.
- b)  The claimant have compensatory parenting time with T. for the two years during which T. was denied all parenting time with the claimant.
- c)  After the successful reunification between the claimant and T., the claimant have parenting time on a week-on/week-off basis.
- [38] The respondent seeks an order that he have primary parenting of T. The respondent opposes any further reunification counselling.

## Section 203 of the Family Law Act : Statutory Framework

- [39] In British Columbia, the court may only appoint counsel for a child if both requirements set out in s. 203(1) of the FLA are satisfied.

- [40] Section 203 provides as follows:
2. 203 (1) The court may at any time appoint a lawyer to represent the interests of a child in a proceeding under this Act if the court is satisfied that
3. (a)  the degree of conflict between the parties is so severe that it significantly impairs the capacity of the parties to act in the best interests of the child, and
4. (b)  it is necessary to protect the best interests of the child.
- (2)  If the court appoints a lawyer under this section, the court may allocate among the parties, or require one party alone to pay, the lawyer's fees and disbursements.
- [41] The reference to the 'best interests' in s. 203(1)(b) of the FLA is to s. 37 of the

FLA . Section 37 of the FLA is clear that in making an agreement or order respecting guardianship, parenting arrangements, or contact with a child, both the parties and the court 'must consider the best interests of the child only'. In determining what is in the best interests of a child the FLA provides that the court must consider 'all the child's needs and circumstances', including their health and emotional well-being (s. 37(2)(a)), and the 'the child's views, unless it would be inappropriate to consider them' (s. 37(2)(b)). Section 37(3) further provides that 'an agreement or order is not in the best interests of a child unless it protects, to the greatest extent possible, the child's physical, psychological, and emotional safety, security and wellbeing'.

## Section 203 of the Family Law Act : The Law

- [42] The leading case on s. 203 of the FLA is J.E.S.D. v. Y.E.P ., 2018 BCCA 286.
- [43] By way of factual overview of J.E.S.D. , the parents were involved in long-running litigation concerning their sole biological child who, by the time the matter reached our Court of Appeal, was 17 years old. The daughter, S., refused any sort of relationship with her father. S. applied to become a full party to the litigation, and to have counsel appointed to represent her. The chambers judge refused that relief under s. 203 of the FLA but, on his own motion, appointed an amicus curia e (to be funded by the Attorney General). S. appealed from the denial of her application for counsel under s. 203 and from the appointment of an amicus . The Attorney General appealed the funding order. The appeal from the order appointing an amicus was allowed. The appeal from the

denial of an order appointing counsel to represent S. was dismissed on the basis that the chambers judge made no error in finding that the requirements under s. 203 of the FLA were not met.

[44] To understand the ratio of the Court of Appeal in J.D.E.S ., it is necessary to appreciate that the chamber's judge's decision (indexed at 2017 BCSC 495) is based on two key conclusions:

- a)  while S.'s parents might face certain limitations in their abilities to represent her best interests, he rejected the idea that 'the degree of conflict between the parties…significantly impair[ed their] capacity…to act in the best interests of the child'. Accordingly, the first requirement set out in s. 203(1)(a) of the FLA was not met; and
- b)  The judge also found that the appointment of counsel for S. would not meet the requirement of s. 203(1)(b) of the FLA ; that such an appointment be 'necessary to protect the best interests of the child.' Rather, he found that appointing counsel to act on S.'s instructions would not serve to protect her best interests.

[45] Writing for the court, Justice Groberman referred to Elmer Driedger's 'modern approach' to statutory interpretation, as adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re) , [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27 at para. 21, and concluded that the chamber's judge's analysis was in conformity with this approach:

27 The chambers judge's analysis of s. 203 is in conformity with this approach. He found that the section sets out two prerequisites to the appointment of a lawyer to represent the interests of a child. First, the court must find that conflict between the parties is so severe that it significantly impairs their ability to act in the best interests of the child. Second, the court must be persuaded that the appointment of counsel is required to protect the best interests of the child. The judge's interpretation respects the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words used in the legislation.

- [46] After a discussion of the role of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , November 20, 1989, Can. T.S. 1992 No. 3 [ UNCRC ]  1 and how Canada's international obligations can inform the interpretation of domestic statutes, even when those obligations have not been implemented in domestic law, Justice Groberman concluded as follows starting at para. 50 of J.E.S.D. :
2. 50 I do not suggest that the child's wishes are to be ignored in assessing what is in the child's best interest. Under s. 37(2)(b) of the Family Law Act , the views of children are a relevant consideration in determining their best interests, unless it would be inappropriate to consider them. This consideration, however, is only one among many that helps a court determine what is in the best interests of the child.
3. 51 In A.C. v. Manitoba (Director of Child and Family Services) , 2009 SCC 30, the Supreme Court of Canada considered the concept of "best interests of the child" in the context of legislation that permitted a court to authorize medical treatment, even against a child's wishes. Justice Abella, writing for the majority, noted that as children gain maturity, their wishes become proportionately more important in determining what is in their best interests. She stated:
- [87] The more a court is satisfied that a child is capable of making a mature, independent decision on his or her own behalf, the greater the weight that will be given to his or her views when a court is exercising its discretion under s. 25(8). In some cases, courts will inevitably be so convinced of a child's maturity that the principles of welfare and autonomy will collapse altogether and the child's wishes will become the controlling factor. ...

...

- [92] The statutory factors reflect decades of careful study into children's needs and how the law can best meet them. ... With our evolving understanding has come the recognition that the quality of decision making about a child is enhanced by input from that child. The extent to which that input affects the "best interests" assessment is as variable as the child's circumstances, but one thing that can be said with certainty is that the input becomes increasingly determinative as the child matures.
2. 52 Inherent in the Court's analysis in A.C. is the recognition that circumstances will exist when the child's wishes do not conform to what is in his or her best interests. Children are sometimes incapable of identifying what is in their own best interests.

1  Article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child makes clear that children have two legal rights with respect to expressing their views:  first, the right to express the child's view's as long as the child is capable of forming their own views; and second, the right to have those views given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child. Canada is a signatory to this Convention.

- 53 While the views and wishes of a mature child, such as S., will be important in determining what is in her best interests, they will not be determinative.
- 54 The chambers judge took into account S.'s desire to be represented by counsel and to be a full party in the proceedings. He considered that desire not to represent her best interests. The judge made no error in reaching that conclusion. S.'s wishes and points of view on appropriate parental arrangements will be before the trial court in a number of forms. She has had, and will have, many opportunities to put her viewpoints and her evidence before the judge. It is essential that S.'s views be before the court. It is not, however, essential that she be cast in the role of an adversarial party in the proceedings.
- 55 Adversarial proceedings can easily destroy goodwill between the parties, and impede the development of healthy relationships. It would be invidious, and contrary to S.'s interests, to place her in an adversarial role against her father or against experts who have been engaged by the court.

[Emphasis added.]

- [47] I was referred to the following additional authorities by counsel:
- a) K.M.H. v. P.S.W. , 2018 BCSC 1318 was argued at or about the same time as the appeal in J.E.D.S. and the reasons for judgment were released approximately one week before. However, although it does not rely on J.E.D.S ., the Court's analysis of s. 203 is not inconsistent with J.E.D.S . Specifically, Justice Skolrood (as he was then) concluded that the application to appoint counsel failed at the first part of the s. 203(1) test as the parenting dispute was not sufficiently 'high conflict' such that the parents' capacity to act in the child's best interests was impaired. In so concluding, Justice Skolrood (who had been the prior trial judge) made reference to the observation of various counselors that the dispute between the parties was a significant contributing factor to the child's anxiety and that involving the child directly in the dispute by making her a party or by appointing counsel for her was not in her best interests and would indeed be detrimental to her wellbeing. Justice Skolrood also noted that the child's views were well known and had been adequately conveyed, including in a judicial interview. The child was 14 at the time of hearing;

- b)  In K.J.C. v. J.E.C ., 2019 BCSC 1908 Justice Wilson followed J.E.D.S. and concluded that the application for appointment of a counsel for a child failed on the first part of the s. 203(1) test given that the parties both maintained they wanted the child to have a relationship with both parents, but it was the child who was refusing any contact with the father. It was also not considered to be in the child's best interests as the child was only 11 and further, at the time as the application to appoint counsel was brought, an order was made appointing Dr. Elterman to prepare a s. 211 assessment; and
- c) In F.J.B. v. J.B.M ., 2023 BCSC 704 Justice Blake followed J.E.D.S. and concluded that both parts of the s. 203 test were satisfied and appointed counsel from the Child and Youth Legal Center together with ancillary orders necessary to facilitate that appointment. Those terms were not outlined in Justice Blake's oral reasons for judgment. The child for whom legal counsel was appointed was 15 years of age and in a residential treatment facility in the eastern United States for very serious mental health issues. The parties had previously consented to the child attending this facility but had very different positions on where the child should reside upon her release -positions further complicated by geography. The evidence in support of s. 203(1)(b), namely that the appointment of counsel was in the best interests of the child, is particularly compelling in F.J.B.

[48] Through my own research into the judicial consideration of s. 203 by this Court, I found several other cases which follow J.E.D.S. :

- a)  In N.J.H. v. J.A.C. , 2025 BCSC 2010, one parent brought an application to appoint counsel on behalf of 14-year-old twins involved in a high-conflict family law proceeding where there was estrangement and the estranged parent was seeking orders for reunification counselling. Justice Morishita dismissed the application on the basis that the evidence did not establish that the parties were so entrenched in their positions or had become so unreasonable that they had lost perspective such that their ability to act in the

best interests of the children was significantly impaired: see para. 17. Justice Morishita was also not satisfied that appointing counsel was in the children's best interests as they had been willing participants in the preparation of the expert reports before the Court and was concerned about getting them more involved in the litigation: see para. 22;

- b)  In A.C.M. v. T.H.M ., 2024 BCSC 883, Justice B. Smith dismissed an application to appoint counsel on behalf of two children. Although Justice B. Smith concluded that the first part of the test under s. 203(1) was satisfied, he concluded the appointment was not in the best interests of the children. Rather, he concluded their best interests were served by distancing them from the conflict between the parties and minimizing further delay in the resolution of that conflict: see para. 95. Of significance, the children in that case were aged 18 and 8 and were both neurodiverse with multiple diagnoses; and
- c) In K.S.P. v. J.T.P. , 2023 BCSC 188, Justice McNaughton (as she was then) dismissed a mid-trial application in highly contentious family law proceedings for the appointment of counsel on behalf the two children, aged 9 and 11, on the basis that drawing the children into the proceedings as parties would further damage all parties' relationships. Further, Justice McNaughton was satisfied that she had sufficient evidence of the children's views through other means, including without limitation, a s. 211 report from Robert Colby: see para. 7.

[49] The above is not intended to be an exhaustive review of the jurisprudence concerning s. 203 of the FLA , given the time available to consider the Child Lawyer Application. However, I am satisfied it is fairly comprehensive in terms of the cases decided postJ.E.D.S. As should be apparent, the test imposed by s. 203 is a stringent one and, as a result, most applications (at least ones that result in reported decisions) have not been successful.

[50] I also acknowledge that I was referred to a few select Ontario authorities. However, the statutory framework for the appointment of counsel in British Columbia differs from Ontario, which means that caselaw from that province on this issue must be appropriately viewed with greater scrutiny beyond not being binding authority upon me. In the circumstances and given the expedited timeline with which these reasons must be written and delivered, I have elected not to substantively address these cases. In future, there are some interesting points that can be gleaned from these authorities that might assist in informing the overall analysis of this issue, but ultimately s. 203 of the FLA requires that both requirements the test be met before the court will appoint a lawyer on behalf of a child in a family law proceeding.

## Analysis

Step One: Is the conflict so severe that it significantly impairs the parties' ability to act in the best interests of the child?

- [51] The Child Lawyer Application was filed on October 8, 2025. However, the evidentiary record upon which it is based necessarily covers what has occurred over a much broader period.
- [52] As a starting point, these parties shared parenting of T. after separation for a period of more than six years. While I strongly anticipate hearing evidence at trial that co-parenting might not have always gone perfectly, the shared parenting was in place pursuant to a separation agreement and there is nothing in the current record about legal proceedings being commenced or any involvement of the Ministry of Children and Family Development.
- [53] The co-parenting situation started showing strain in the early months of 2022 when T. was approximately 11.5 years of age. However, even then it was not obvious that the situation was falling entirely off the rails. It was a challenging time, and I again expect I will hear considerable evidence at trial about how it was handled (or mishandled). However, as much as parenting evolves generally as a child matures, so do the requirements of co-parenting. What is required to successfully parent a five and one-half-year-old child is very different than what is required to successfully parent an

11 and one-half-year-old child. Similarly, what is required to successfully co-parent a five and one-half-year-old child is not necessarily the same as successfully co-parenting an 11 and one-half-year-old child.

[54] However, it was almost exactly three years ago that T. began a period of complete estrangement with the claimant that lasted some 25 months. That is when the situation had clearly and unequivocally come off the rails.

[55] At what I will classify as the height of that period of estrangement, as I detailed above, the respondent applied and obtained a Protection Order which precluded any contact whatsoever between claimant and T. This is realistically the most extreme step that can be taken in a family law proceeding given the high threshold required -namely that 'family violence is likely to occur': see s. 183(2)(a) of the FLA .

[56] I recognize the Protection Order was set aside approximately two months after it was obtained, but it paints the necessary picture of how high conflict this parenting dispute was at the time that order was granted by (then) Master Schwartz. It was not a conduct order under Part 10, Division 5 of the FLA . It was a Protection Order obtained under s. 183 of the FLA , an order which is enforceable by the police under s. 188 of the FLA .

[57] Upon the Protection Order being set aside, the parties engaged Robert Colby to prepare the s. 211 assessment I referenced above. The ultimate delivery of the s. 211 assessment on or about February 28, 2024 did not immediately provide solutions to the conflict because T. and the claimant remained estranged and the parties continued to march along towards the October 2024 trial date.

[58] With the benefit of experienced counsel, the Interim Consent Order was negotiated on the eve of that trial. The fact that it is 12 pages long dealing exclusively with parenting issues and ancillary (non-financial) issues relating to T. underscores the amount of effort that was required. Having participated, to some degree, in discussions to finalize those terms on what was to be the first day of trial, I personally observed some of that effort required.

[59] To their mutual credit, the parties agreed on engaging the RTT and to participate in the SFRT. In approving the terms of the Interim Consent Order, I agreed that was in T.'s best interests, as is my obligation under s. 37(3) of the FLA . It was not merely rubber stamped.

[60] However, in addition to the subsequent extensive efforts of the RTT team, the parties have continued to require significant assistance from counsel. Again, without detailing the reams of correspondence appended to various affidavits, this is something I have personal knowledge of given the number of case management conferences I presided over. By review of my notes, there have been 12 such conferences.

[61] Importantly, since the end of the SFRT, Ms. Blancher continues to be the intermediary between the respondent and the claimant in communicating about T. I think it is important to recognize that Ms. Blancher's involvement in their communications is different, based on my observations and prior experience, than that of a parenting coordinator. It is a level of involvement beyond that.

[62] Appreciating that this is just a high-level summary of a much more extensive evidentiary record, which is really all that time permits me given how close before trial this Child Lawyer Application was brought and argued, I am satisfied this is a case where the degree of conflict between the parties is so severe that it significantly impairs the capacity of the parties to act in the best interests of T.

[63] In this regard, having reread J.E.D.S. multiple times and the cases following it which I have referred to, it is my view that the threshold set under s. 203(1)(a) of the FLA must not be so high that it requires what amounts to permanent impairment. The claimant and the respondent are currently 'doing kind of okay' in their co-parenting of T. with 'some bumps in the road', but it is being guided by the ongoing post-reunification assistance of Mr. Blanchard, being very closely managed through experienced lawyers, and occurring with the knowledge that the court retains its judiciary supervisory role that the parties specifically agreed to in the Interim Consent Order until such time as there is a final order made.

[64] Simply put, while I do not want to dimmish the progress the parties have collectively made since October of 2024, I still consider the degree of conflict to be so severe that it meets the threshold under s. 203(1)(a) of the FLA .

## Step Two: Is it necessary to protect the best interests of the child?

[65] The more challenging issue is whether the appointment of counsel would be in T.'s best interests.

[66] Firstly, the situation is somewhat unique in that the parties and T. have already completed the SFRT program. The situation is fragile, as I have described, and they require the ongoing support of the RTT, but they have completed the program.

[67] Further, while it was only in April 2025 that the shared parenting started and has certainly not been without some challenges,the transition to shared parenting happened and the shared parenting continues. Even in the lead up to trial.

[68] The situation is thus materially different than it was at the time of the October 2024 trial. Practically speaking, T.'s views were well known at that time. She had not had any contact with the claimant for two years.

[69] Further, at the October 2024 trial the Court (namely me) would presumably have had the benefit of the s. 211 assessment prepared by Robert Colby, which I strongly anticipate addresses T.'s views given her age and maturity. While I cannot prejudge any other objections that might be made by the claimant regarding the s. 211 assessment, there would have been no basis to argue at that time that the report was stale dated.

[70] The Court at the upcoming trial will not have the benefit of an updated s. 211 assessment which would, inter alia , address T.'s views after having completed the SFRT and resumed shared parenting. Those views are very important and may well be entirely different than they were at the time that the prior s. 211 was completed in February of 2024. An updated s. 211 would have been my first preference to receive these views as I am not satisfied that a judicial interview is the most appropriate way to

proceed in this case given the complexities, including, without limitation, the possibility of further reunification counselling.

[71] Further, as noted, when T. first met with Ms. Debuck of the Child and Youth Legal Centre and was explained her options to have her views considered in these proceedings, T. did not indicate a desire for a judicial interview. This is despite having already met with me (albeit in a different context). Accordingly, while I am not ruling out the possibility that a traditional judicial interview may be appropriate, I am not prepared to entirely disregard T.'s views that it was not one of her top two preferences to have her views considered by me when I, as the trial judge, ultimately make whatever orders that I consider to be in T.'s best interests.

[72] Further, and with no disrespect to the RTT, and specifically Ms. Blancher, I am not inclined to defer to her view that T. 'should not have any input in court proceedings'.

[73] This is not necessarily in line with the jurisprudence which I have outlined above or with the seminal decision of Madam Justice Martinson in B.J.G. v. D.L.G., 2010 YKSC 44. The views of a child are clearly not determinative and must be addressed appropriately and thoughtfully by the court, but there is an appropriate role for children in family law proceedings concerning them and the FLA expressly recognizes that in very limited circumstances that can involve appointing a lawyer on behalf of the child.

[74] Having deliberated at some length and specifically considering the views of my fellow justices referred to above which warn of the dangers of drawing children further into high-conflict parenting disputes and the potential consequential damage that could flow from that, I am satisfied that in these particular circumstances it is in T.'s best interest that T. be appointed counsel on the limited terms I shall outline below.

[75] Simply stated, without the appointment of counsel, I am not satisfied that I will have satisfactory evidence as T.'s views post-completion of the SFRT to make prospective orders that are in her best interests as I am statutorily required to do. As I have already noted, T.'s views are not determinative and must be weighed in

consideration of all the evidence in the multifactorial analysis required, but I think the involvement of counsel in the manner described by Ms. Jenab will be of valuable assistance to the Court in conducting that analysis.

[76] In this regard, I am further satisfied that Mr. Jenab, having met with T. for the purposes of preparing the Child's Lawyer Application, did not disqualify her from being appointed as T.'s counsel given her explanation as to what occurred and the limited nature of her involvement after the referral from the Child and Youth Legal Centre prior to filing the Child Lawyer Application.

## Ancillary Orders

- [77] As set out in Appendix 'A', a broad range of ancillary orders are sought along with the appointment of a lawyer to act for T. I understand from Ms. Jenab that the orders sought are from the standard precedent utilized by the Child and Youth Legal Centre when applications are brought pursuant to s. 203 of the FLA .
- [78] I am not satisfied that all the ancillary orders sought in the Child Lawyer Application are necessary and/or appropriate in this case.
- [79] As a starting point, I am not ordering that counsel for T shall have the full power to act for T. as if they are a party to these proceedings. Rather, I am appointing counsel on the terms of this order and delineating what counsel for T. is authorized to receive and to do. That authorization is limited to the following:
- a)  T.'s counsel shall receive copies of correspondence between counsel for the parties which pertain only to issues relating to T. and to the preparation of and conduct of the trial (for example, witness schedules and so forth). T.'s counsel shall not receive copies of any correspondence between counsel relating to financial issues;
- b)  T.'s counsel shall receive copies of all expert reports relating to T.;
- c)  T.'s counsel shall have the right to appear and participate in this proceeding, including making submissions to the Court, such submissions to include

positions advanced on behalf of T. The right to appear and participate does not include the right to examine or cross-examine witnesses or to call evidence;

- d)  T.'s counsel shall be entitled to receive a copy of the document books prepared on behalf of the claimant and the respondent for use at trial, but all the documents pertaining to financial issues shall removed. For clarity in this regard, counsel is not required to prepare separate indexes. All that is required is that the tabs containing documents on financial issues be empty in the version provided to T.'s counsel;
- e)  T.'s counsel shall have the right to talk to and meet with T. alone and confidentially, at any location, except the parents' respective residences, without prior notice to the parties, including but not limited to at T.'s school;
- f) T.'s counsel shall have the right to talk to and meet with T. alone and confidentially, with reasonable prior notice to the parties, at the residence of either parent;
- g)  T.'s counsel shall have the right to communicate directly with the parties exclusively for the purpose of scheduling any meeting with T. in accordance with this order and not for any other purpose;
- h)  T.'s counsel shall have the right to apply to be removed as counsel, if counsel for the T. believes that such involvement is no longer in T.'s best interest or as instructed to do so by T; and
- i) T.'s counsel shall be permitted to take such other steps or receive such other documents as may be authorized by the Court during the course of the trial.

[80] I am expressly dismissing the relief sought in paragraph 3 of the Child Lawyer Application which would allow T.'s counsel expansive authority to gather evidence and documents. Firstly, I have ordered that the right to appear and participate does not include the right to call evidence. Further, this proceeding is in the final stages of trial

preparation. The window for additional document disclosure of this magnitude has long since closed.

- [81] Counsel for T. shall be permitted to provide a summary to this Court of the information acquired while performing her duties, and by doing so counsel shall not be deemed to be a witness in these proceedings.
- [82] Finally, I make a further order that there shall be no ex parte communications between counsel for the parties and counsel for T. If counsel for T. receives any ex parte correspondence, it must be shared forthwith by T.'s counsel with all other counsel. Further, the only communications, verbally or in writing, between counsel for T. and the parties directly shall be limited to scheduling to meet with T. in accordance with the terms of this order as per para. 79(g) of these reasons for judgment and for no other purpose.

## Cost of T.'s Counsel

- [83] Ms. Jenab advised the Court that she did not anticipate that counsel for T. would be required to attend all of the trial and that counsel's level of participation would be situation specific.
- [84] Nevertheless, this trial is already scheduled for 15 days, with the expectation of another 10 to 15 days. Even attending portions of the trial will come at some considerable cost.
- [85] The respondent is of significantly greater means than the claimant. The respondent, as noted, paid the initial retainer to Ms. Jenab and consented to the relief sought in the Child Lawyer Application.
- [86] In the circumstances, the respondent shall be responsible for all of the costs associated with T.'s counsel without any contribution and/or indemnity from the claimant.

[87] Neither party nor T.'s counsel shall disclose to T. the funding arrangements for T.'s counsel. That information is being kept strictly confidential pursuant to this order and that is all that T. needs to be informed of if she were to inquire.
