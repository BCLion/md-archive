- [1] In these family proceedings, the primary issues are parenting time and decision-making authority for the parties' nine-year-old daughter, L., child support [both past and future] and the division of family property and debt.
- [2] At the conclusion of the trial the parties agreed that the spousal support claim of the claimant, who is the wife and mother, is settled by payment of lump sum spousal support by the respondent in the amount of $16,800, within 30 days of issuance of these reasons for judgment.

## II. BACKGROUND

- [3] The parties began cohabiting on May 1, 2009, when the claimant moved into the respondent's home on Gee Street, in Maple Ridge, which the respondent had purchased in 2003 (the 'Gee Street residence').  They agree that they commenced a marriage like relationship at that time and became spouses within the meaning of s. 3 of the Family Law Act , S.B.C. 2011 c. 25 [the FLA or the Act ].  They separated on January 26, 2018, when the claimant moved out of the home the parties were then living in, located on a rural property on Spratt Road, Mission (the 'Spratt Road property').
- [4] The parties have one child together: L., born July 2010.  Currently she is nine years of age. When they separated, the claimant took L. with her to a transition home.  Later the claimant moved to a rented suite in a home in Mission, where she continues to reside.  The respondent continues to reside at the Spratt Road property, which is located about 20 to 25 minutes from the commercial centre of Mission.

[5] Since separation, L. has primarily resided with the claimant.  During the school year L. has been with her father, the respondent, every weekend from Friday afternoon until Monday morning.  The respondent also has L. on Wednesday evenings from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m.  This interim parenting schedule was imposed by

the claimant, but the respondent did not apply to vary it.  There have been no interim applications in these proceedings.

- [6] By a consent order made by Master Taylor at the Judicial Case Conference on July 18, 2018, the parties agreed to the appointment of Dr. Michael Elterman to carry out a 'full report' (that is, an assessment) under s. 211 of the FLA .  Thus, as specified in s. 211, Dr. Elterman was to assess the needs of the child, the views of the child, and the ability and willingness of the parties to satisfy the needs of the child.
- [7] Neither party suggests that the other is an unfit parent.  As noted, the issues relating to L. are the parenting schedule and decision-making authority and process.
- [8] During the course of the proceedings, in September 2018, the claimant offered to change to a 50/50 schedule, but the respondent declined, as he preferred to wait for Dr. Elterman's report before making any changes to the schedule. Dr. Elterman's report was concluded December 16, 2018.
- [9] In his report to the court Dr. Elterman recommends joint guardianship, with primary residency and decision-making for education, health and activities to the respondent.  He recommends that L. reside with the claimant for a total of two days per week during the school year, and that vacation times be divided equally on a week on and week off basis.  In overall terms this schedule provides that L. would reside with the claimant about 34% of the time, and with the respondent 66% of the time.
- [10] The respondent supports the schedule and other recommendations of Dr. Elterman.  The claimant contends that a week on/week off schedule would be best.  As the parties have been unable to agree on the schedule, the interim parenting schedule in effect since separation has remained in place.
- [11] The parties met in late 2007.  The claimant was working part-time (25 hours per week) at a Starbucks coffee shop in Maple Ridge. The respondent had taken a few months off from his work as a heavy-duty mechanic, to renovate his home on

Gee Street.  He was frequenting the Starbucks while renovating the kitchen. The parties began a relationship but did not begin cohabiting until much later, on May 1, 2009, when the claimant moved into the Gee Street residence.

- [12] When they began cohabiting, the claimant was 32 years of age, and the respondent was 33.  She had two children, from separate relationships, and he had none.  Her eldest, a son, N., was born in 1998.  Her second child, a daughter, R., was born in 2005.  A few months after the parties began cohabiting R. began residing with the parties.  When the relationship ended R. moved to Kelowna to reside with her father.
- [13] During 2015, the respondent purchased the Spratt Road property, and several months later, sold the Gee Street residence.  The parties moved to the Spratt Road property, where they continued to reside until separation.  The respondent continues to reside there.
- [14] The respondent was employed full time throughout the relationship.
- [15] The claimant has struggled for many years with drug addiction and mental health issues.  She ran away from home at age 14.  She began abusing drugs as a teenager.  Later she used cocaine and heroin.  She testified that she was mainly drug free when she was in her 20's but had several relapses.  In her teen years and into her mid 20's she had deliberately cut herself at times and had received psychiatric treatment for this.  She was hospitalized on four occasions for depression, and also suffered from psychotic episodes.  She was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and PTSD.
- [16] The claimant later achieved high school graduation on a GED program.
- [17] When the relationship began, the claimant was receiving provincial government permanent disability ('PWD') payments as a result of her mental health conditions.  Her two children were in the care of their respective fathers, after Ministry of Children and Family Development ('MCFD')  interventions.  After the parties met in late 2007 the claimant relapsed with drug addiction.  She spent much

of 2008 and early 2009 in detox and rehabilitation programs.  In early 2009 she overdosed on methadone and nearly died.

- [18] Since the parties began cohabiting May 1, 2009, the claimant's mental health and drug addiction conditions have generally been in good control.  She has not used cocaine or heroin since before the relationship with the respondent began. However as the relationship began to break down in 2017 the claimant had a reoccurrence of drug and mental health problems.  She began using marijuana.  She used clonazepam that she obtained from an acquaintance, for treatment of her anxiety.  She had used clonazepam by prescription in prior years.  Her self-harm (cutting) behaviour re-occurred in May 2017, on two occasions.  She says the cutting was mild.  She saw her family doctor, who referred her to a psychiatrist.
- [19] The claimant has continued to receive mental health treatment and support since June 2017, with good results. She has stopped using marijuana.  She does not use alcohol.  She attends Narcotics Anonymous, and continues with regular personal therapeutic counselling.  She takes anti-depressant and chronic pain medications. She finds yoga helpful.
- [20] As noted, the respondent works full-time as a heavy-duty mechanic.  He works on commercial trucks.  He operates the Spratt Road property as a farm, mainly raising chickens and selling eggs.  The farm is not profitable.
- [21] The claimant works part-time as a house-cleaner.
- [22] Once the parties separated, the claimant's PWD benefit entitlement was reinstated.  She continued to work part-time as a housecleaner.
- [23] The claimant currently resides in a rented first-floor or basement suite in Mission.  Her income consists of PWD benefits in the amount of $1,556 per month and the housecleaning earnings.  She is permitted to earn up to $1000 per month before deductions are made from her PWD benefits.

- [24] Dr. Elterman did not testify at the trial.  At the outset of the trial claimant's counsel indicated that she wished to cross-examine Dr. Elterman.  However, no arrangements had been made to secure his attendance at trial for that purpose.  The claimant agreed to proceed without cross-examining Dr. Elterman.
- [25] As usual Dr. Elterman's report is thorough.  In my view, bearing in mind the totality of the evidence and all of the circumstances, Dr. Elterman's attendance at the trial would not have made a difference.
- [26] The facts set out in the s. 211 report are prima facie evidence of the truth of those facts: K.M.W. v. L.J.W ., 2010 BCCA 572, at para. 50 (in relation to the predecessor legislation, s. 15 of the Family Relations Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 128 [ FRA] ); L.D.K. v. M.A.K ., 2015 BCSC 226, at para. 50 (applying the same principle to s. 211 of the FLA .)

[27] In general the parties did not seek to challenge the facts relied upon by Dr. Elterman.  The claimant challenges his opinions, of course, and a few statements made by the respondent to Dr. Elterman as recorded in his report.  In particular, the parties disagree as to the reason that the claimant and R.'s father decided that R. should move to Kelowna to reside with her father upon the parties' separation.  According to the respondent R.'s father told him that he was concerned about the claimant's drug problems.  At trial, R.'s father denied saying this. The issue is tangential at best, and in my view there is no need for me to resolve it.

## III. ISSUES

## A. Parenting Arrangements

## 1. Legal Principles

[28] The recommendations of the s. 211 assessor are admissible, but it is open to me to agree or disagree as I see fit, based upon the evidence at trial.  The s. 211 author may provide an opinion, but it is for the court to decide the matters at issue: A.P. v. J.C ., 2018 BCSC 1381, at paras. 108 - 126.

- [29] Section 37 of the FLA is as follows:

## Best interests of child

- 37 (1) In making an agreement or order under this Part respecting guardianship, parenting arrangements or contact with a child, the parties and the court must consider the best interests of the child only.
- (2) To determine what is in the best interests of a child, all of the child's needs and circumstances must be considered, including the following:
- (a) the child's health and emotional well-being;
- (b) the child's views, unless it would be inappropriate to consider them;
- (c) the nature and strength of the relationships between the child and significant persons in the child's life;
- (d) the history of the child's care;
- (e) the child's need for stability, given the child's age and stage of development;
- (f) the ability of each person who is a guardian or seeks guardianship of the child, or who has or seeks parental responsibilities, parenting time or contact with the child, to exercise his or her responsibilities;
- (g) the impact of any family violence on the child's safety, security or well-being, whether the family violence is directed toward the child or another family member;
- (h) whether the actions of a person responsible for family violence indicate that the person may be impaired in his or her ability to care for the child and meet the child's needs;
- (i) the appropriateness of an arrangement that would require the child's guardians to cooperate on issues affecting the child, including whether requiring cooperation would increase any risks to the safety, security or well-being of the child or other family members;
- (j) any civil or criminal proceeding relevant to the child's safety, security or well-being.
- (3) An agreement or order is not in the best interests of a child unless it protects, to the greatest extent possible, the child's physical, psychological and emotional safety, security and well-being.
- (4) In making an order under this Part, a court may consider a person's conduct only if it substantially affects a factor set out in subsection (2), and only to the extent that it affects that factor.

## 2. Dr. Elterman Report

[30] In his report, Dr. Elterman canvasses the personal histories of the parties and the history of their relationship in considerable detail.  It is not necessary for me to reiterate his comments here.  He administered psychological tests to each party.  He interviewed collateral sources, and interviewed L.  He attended at the home of each parent and made observations.

- [31] Dr. Elterman expressed his recommendation as follows:

My recommendation in this case is for the parents to share joint guardianship. I would recommend that [T.M.] have primary parenting responsibility around decision-making regarding education, health and activities. I recommend this because I believe that he is the more stable individual and that his judgement around what is best for [L.] is more likely to be in tune with her best interests. I would recommend that primary residence be with [T.M.] partly because I have concluded that from the perspective of temperament, risk and the child's preferences, that this is a better arrangement for [L.].

- [32] The claimant makes several criticisms of Dr. Elterman's report.
- [33] She contends that the respondent provided inaccurate information to Dr. Elterman about certain matters.  These are as follows:
- a)  as noted, the reason that R. went to live with her father when the parties separated;
- b)  the respondent's perception of MCFD's reason for allowing R. to live with the claimant after they began cohabiting; and
- c)  the nature of the relationship between the respondent and Ms. W., with whom he had a previous long-term relationship.
- [34] These matters are of little or no significance to the issue to be decided, in my view.

[35] The claimant contends that Dr. Elterman did not ask her about her concerns about the respondent's parenting, while apparently giving considerable weight to the

respondent's reciprocal concerns.  She also notes that Dr. Elterman spent less time with her than he did with the respondent.

[36] Dr. Elterman's report indicates that he spent five hours with her, in total, compared to six hours with the respondent.  She says that he cut two of her meetings short due to other commitments, and that he actually spent only four hours and 15 minutes with her.  Since Dr. Elterman did not testify I do not have his response to this criticism.

[37] Based upon the report, I do not agree that Dr. Elterman did not canvass the claimant's stated concerns about the respondent's parenting.  The report sets out expressly each parties' concerns, in list form, and the response of each party to the concerns expressed by the other.  More importantly, from the point of view of substance, in my view Dr. Elterman fairly considered the perspectives of both parents, in detail.

[38] The claimant contends that Dr. Elterman focused on her history of drug use but did not acknowledge that she has been drug free for over ten years.  While in his report Dr. Elterman does not expressly acknowledge this, there is no material inaccuracy in the report, as it relates to the claimant's drug and mental health history or status.  The contention is really that Dr. Elterman should have placed more weight on her more recent condition as compared with her history.

[39] I am not persuaded that this is a valid criticism.  The claimant's history of drug use and mental health issues is clearly relevant.  However, I observe that Dr. Elterman recommends joint guardianship, with L. spending about 34% of her time in the claimant's care.  I am confident that if the claimant's condition currently was similar to that which existed prior to May 2009, Dr. Elterman would have made very different recommendations, such as for limited and perhaps supervised parenting time for the claimant.  The parenting issue in this case would have been more fundamental, and would not have simply been the question of the best parenting arrangements and schedule.

[40] The claimant argues that Dr. Elterman did not receive accurate information from the respondent about his use of alcohol.  He told Dr. Elterman that alcohol has never been a problem for him.  Based upon the evidence at trial, this is not inaccurate.  In her testimony the claimant did not allege that the respondent has a problem with alcohol consumption.  She did not mention it to Dr. Elterman as a concern, which no doubt explains why he mentions it only briefly.  Other witnesses who would be in a position to know did not testify that the respondent abused or overconsumed alcohol. No witness at trial testified to any concern about this.  The respondent's regular purchases of alcohol is material to his financial and budgeting problem, however.

[41] The claimant argues that Dr. Elterman did not have accurate information regarding the respondent's temperament.  The claimant argues that the respondent tends to be angry and, even, emotionally abusive.

[42] The claimant testified about several specific instances in which the respondent had yelled at her, and said that he often yelled at her.  Some instances were supported by the testimony of other witnesses.  Her therapist Lana Gowler testified about one such incident.  Her son N. testified about others.

[43] I accept that the relationship between the claimant and respondent was unhappy and troubled, and that there were conflicts, particularly in the time leading to their separation.  The claimant's son N. testified to the respondent yelling at his mother frequently.  Some evidence of the respondent frequently being angry with the claimant also came from the claimant's mother.  I place less weight on her testimony, as it was too heavily influenced by bias.  It is apparent that the claimant's mother does not like the respondent.  Some of her testimony was simply hearsay from the claimant.

[44] My impression is that the respondent did not view the claimant as competent and reliable, and I infer that this must have led to conflicts.  The respondent accused the claimant of killing a cat by giving the diabetic cat insulin when she should not have done so.  She was accused of allowing the dogs to kill some goats, through

inadequate supervision, and of allowing the dogs to escape the property and threaten a neighbour's horses, and losing her keys.  He disapproved of her grocery shopping decisions.  Dr. Elterman noted that the respondent tends to be fairly suspicious in his outlook.  This tendency also appears to have negatively affected the relationship.

- [45] However the evidence as a whole does not support that the respondent is generally an angry person or that he has temperament or personality issues that affect his relationship with L., his parenting skills, or the issues to be decided.  The evidence is to the opposite effect. Dr. Elterman, as a trained psychologist, states:

The self-concept of this individual is generally stable and positive and he is normally a confident person who approaches life with a sense of purpose. He describes being reasonably self-satisfied at what his goals are. His interpersonal style is characterized as being modest, unpretentious and retiring. He is likely to be self-conscious in social interactions and is probably not skilled or comfortable in asserting himself.

Others view him as passive, humble and unassuming. He reports experiencing a degree of stress as a result of difficulties in some major life areas. He reports that he has a number of supportive relationships that appear to serve as an effective buffer against the effect of stress. He describes his temper as within the normal range and being controlled without apparent difficulty.

The Aggression Questionnaire is a measure of anger and aggression. The test is divided into Total Aggression, Physical Aggression, Verbal Aggression, Anger, Hostility and Indirect Expression of Aggression. Scores on the total and subtest scales are within normal limits.

- [46] The respondent's ex-wife and former step-daughter gave convincing evidence as to the respondent's calm and reasonable personality.  The mother of a close friend of L.'s described him as kind, considerate, and a very nice man.
- [47] Both parties remained calm and composed during sometimes vigorous crossexamination at trial.
- [48] L. was quite positive about both parents in her conversation with Dr. Elterman.  She told Dr. Elterman that the parent who yells most and gets mad

quickest is her mother.  She said that if she had a problem she would find it easiest to talk to her dad, because he really helps her, he understand her better, and he doesn't get so mad so quickly. L. also said that she is happy with her life, because mom and dad don't yell at each other anymore.

- [49] In summary, I am not persuaded that Dr. Elterman relied upon inaccurate information or that he failed to give due weight to relevant considerations.  I do not find that the respondent has an angry personality which would affect my decision.
- [50] Dr. Elterman's psychological testing results for the claimant are unremarkable.  There was no evidence of clinical psychopathology.  The claimant has a reasonably stable and positive self-evaluation.  Testing for aggression and child abuse potential show no concerns.

## 3. Parenting Arrangements - Overview

- [51] Both parties are capable, loving parents.  As long as the claimant continues to refrain from drug abuse and continues successful management of her mental health, there should be no concerns about her parenting of L.  Although she had problems in 2017, the claimant has recovered since then.  Overall, she has successfully managed these problems for many years and so I expect that she will continue to do so.
- [52] There are two competing proposals for the parenting schedule.
- [53] In the circumstances the claimant's suggestion of year-round, week on and week off parenting would not be unreasonable. Indeed, this is what Dr. Elterman recommends for the thirteen vacation weeks in each year.
- [54] However, on the evidence as a whole, in my view it is in L.'s best interests that L. spend the majority of her time for the non-vacation part of the year with the respondent.  This accords with Dr. Elterman's evidence, opinions and recommendations, which I consider valid and helpful.

[55] I also agree with Dr. Elterman that the respondent should have primary responsibility for making major decisions affecting L.

## 4. FLA section 37

[56] FLA s. 37(2) directs that in order to determine what is in the best interests of a child, all of the child's needs and circumstances must be considered.  Section 37(3) adds, (superfluously) that an agreement or order is not in the best interests of a child unless it protects, to the greatest extent possible, the child's physical, psychological and emotional safety, security and well-being.  Subsection (2) sets out a list of specific factors or criteria, which I will now comment upon.

- [57] The following headings are abbreviated, for convenience.

## a) the child's health and emotional well-being

[58] L. is physically healthy and does not have special needs. She has struggled somewhat with reading.  L. told Dr. Elterman that both parents help her with homework.  The evidence at trial was to the same effect. Her reading has improved. They both arrange play dates with her closest friends.

- [59] Emotionally and personality wise L. appears to be somewhat closer to her father.  This was Dr. Elterman's comment based upon his personal observations of L. in the company of each parent. Ms. H., the mother of one of L.'s close friends had a similar observation.  It accords with L.'s comments to Dr. Elterman that if she had a problem, she would find it easier to talk to her father, and also, that she does not spend enough time with her father, and would like to spend a lot more time with him.
- [60] This factor supports that primary parenting should be with the respondent.
- [61] I would not expect either parent to claim to be perfect.  I note that the father has a habit of relying heavily on fast food restaurant meals.  This is obvious on a review of his spending records.  For example, during the month of June 2019 the respondent visited restaurants, mostly of the fast-food variety (Burger King, Wendy's, Subway, A&amp;W, Tim Horton's, etc.) over 30 times, according to his bank

records.  This is a consistent pattern over time. He personally has problems with weight control.  Although the matter of nutrition was not well-developed in the evidence, I have a concern about how this habit could affect L.

[62] By contrast, the claimant's expenses do not show this pattern. Her son N. testified that his mother prepares healthy meals.

[63] Dr. Elterman did not discuss nutrition in his report, unfortunately.  The claimant did not raise this as an issue with Dr. Elterman, or in her evidence at trial.

[64] Since the matter of nutrition and promotion of healthy lifestyle habits was not properly developed in the evidence, I cannot place significant weight on it.  I flag it as an area of concern for the parties and, possibly, future decision-makers.

## b) the child's views

[65] L. told Dr. Elterman that she wanted to spend more time with her father, and less time with her mother.  Dr. Elterman did not question the sincerity or reliability of these comments.  It is possible that this comment was driven in some part by the fact that the respondent has a farm with animals, and that L. enjoys this environment and the activities it provides.  However, in my view it is not likely that her stated preference is simply superficial. It is apparent that Dr. Elterman placed significant weight on this factor, and I agree that it is appropriate to do so in this case. In the circumstances of this case L.'s own views are entitled to some weight.

[66] I interviewed L. privately. I enjoyed meeting her, but I noted that she was quite reticent.  Because I had the benefit of Dr. Elterman's report I did not need to ask L. for her views directly.  In my discussion with her, she did not express any preference for one parent over the other, or comment about the schedule, although I provided opportunities for her to do so.  She seemed reluctant to do so, perhaps for good reason, since I explained and she understood that I was the judge who had to make decisions over matters where her parents could not agree.  My interview did not undermine the validity of her comments to Dr. Elterman.

## c) the relationships between the child and significant persons in the child's life

[67] I have already referred to this in terms of the relationship between L. and her parents.

- [68] Otherwise, this is not a particularly strong factor in this case. L.'s step-sister R. is now 13 years of age, and resides with her father in Kelowna. She visits her mother, the claimant, regularly.  At present L. is not close to R.  L. told Dr. Elterman that R. can be mean to her and 'we hardly get along.' In my interview with her, she volunteered that R. can be mean to her.  The claimant's mother's family includes several step-children and step-siblings.  The claimant's mother and her husband like to ski and boat.  The family congregates in the Okanagan valley each summer. L. does not ski.
- [69] The respondent is emotionally closest to his older brother, who lives in White Rock with his father. His mother resides in Abbotsford.
- [70] Neither party has re-partnered.
- [71] In my view the schedule suggested by Dr. Elterman provides ample opportunity for L. to continue with relationships with members of both families.  Her school and school friendships are not likely to be substantially affected.

## d) the history of the child's care

[72] This is also not a strong factor in this case.  For practical reasons the majority of L.'s day to day care as a young child has been done by the claimant, as the respondent has at all times been working full time, or more than full time.  Despite this, both parents have been involved with L.'s care from birth.  The respondent took paternity leave of three months when L. was an infant.

## e) the child's need for stability

- [73] Either parent is capable of providing a stable and secure environment.  By history, the respondent is a very stable individual, while the claimant is much less so.

The respondent had one long term relationship before the relationship with the claimant.  The prior relationship ended amicably.  He has been steadily employed for many years, and there is no reason to expect that he will not continue to be steadily employed.

[74] The claimant deserves to be commended for her progress in overcoming her addiction and mental health problems.  As noted, she is managing these issues well at present.  However, this case is not about rewarding achievements, nor is it about penalizing anyone for past faults or failures.  The sole question to be decided is what is in L.'s best interests.  From that perspective, I cannot ignore that the claimant has a risk of relapse or reoccurrence of problems.  There was some relapse of problems in 2017 when the relationship with the respondent was causing stress.  The claimant relied on marijuana to help her.  She used prescription medication (clonazepam) which was not prescribed for her at that time, although she had used it in the past, as prescribed.  She suffered a relapse of mental health issues.  She has since recovered with treatment and sustained effort.  Prior to 2017, the claimant's longest period of sobriety was while in the relationship with the respondent.  Re-occurrence of the claimant's prior problems would at minimum be harmful to L., or could cause unpredictable safety risks.

[75] Dr. Elterman mentions 'risk' in relation to his recommendation.  I interpret this comment to refer to risks of this sort.

[76] The respondent acknowledges that he has been spending beyond his means for several years.  Equity in the Gee Street home realized on its sale has been spent.  Essentially, it is lost. His farm business loses money.  He overspends on discretionary and wasteful expenses such as fast food (previously mentioned) and alcohol.  He states optimistically that he will be able to somehow retain the farm property.  However, he has no real plan for doing so.  It seems clear that he will have to improve his budgeting and expense control very substantially or face losing the Spratt Road property.  Nonetheless, he is an industrious person who has the ability to provide for L.'s care and I am confident that he will do so.

## f) the ability of each person…to exercise his or her responsibilities

[77] This appears to have been a decisive factor in the opinion of Dr. Elterman, and once again I agree.  As noted, Dr. Elterman states that, '...[the respondent] is the more stable individual and that his judgement around what is best for [L.] is more likely to be in tune with her best interests.'

[78] This factor overlaps with factor (d) in relation to the concept of 'stability', and I re-iterate my previous comments in that respect.

[79] Dr. Elterman mentions judgment.  The claimant has demonstrated poor judgment in the past, in several spheres, mostly related to drug abuse.  Specific instances include taking methadone supplied by another resident in a facility, allegedly for pain relief, and using non-prescribed prescription medicine, and using marijuana, in 2017.  I recognize that the claimant's questionable judgment may well be due to factors or circumstances beyond her control, such as addiction and mental health issues.  My task is not to find fault or assess causation, or blame.  However, judgment is relevant. In relation to the best interests of L., the respondent is more likely to exercise good judgment, or less likely to exercise poor judgment.

[80] While I do not mean to disparage the claimant's part time work as a housecleaner, the respondent provides a good role model for L. in that he has always been a steady full-time worker.

## g) the impact of any family violence

- [81] 'Family violence' is defined broadly in s. 1(1) of the FLA .

[82] As noted, the claimant sought to portray the respondent as a person who has anger problems, and who frequently yelled at her.  Aspects of her evidence also indicated that he was controlling, in terms of finances, and about her personal decisions such as who she should associate with.  I have already concluded that the respondent is not generally a person with anger problems.  The evidence of controlling behaviour was not persuasive. L. mentioned to Dr. Elterman that she was

glad that her parents were no longer yelling at each other, so it seems that the verbal hostilities were at least somewhat mutual.

- [83] This is not a significant factor in this case.  Analysis of the matters referred to in s. 38 does not add anything material.
- [84] FLA s. 37(2) factors (h) and (j) are not applicable in this case.

## i) an arrangement that would require the child's guardians to cooperate

- [85] This factor seems designed to encourage cooperation in decision making affecting the child between the child's guardians, where appropriate.  Clearly, in an appropriate case, cooperative decision-making would be desirable.  However, in other cases, of which this is one, conflicts are more likely to be avoided if one parent has primary decision-making responsibility.
- [86] In relation to decision-making authority, in J.A.F. v. J.J.F ., 2019 BCSC 507, I stated:
- [24]         A summary of considerations that have been applied in other cases in relation to the issue of decision-making authority is set out in J.E.H. v. P.L.H. , 2013 BCSC 752. At para. 58, Abrioux J. wrote:
4.  there has been a general unwillingness to impose mandatory joint decision-making on parents who cannot get along and are unable to communicate. This is out of concern for the well-being of the children;
5.  the ability of the parents to communicate and cooperate remains an important factor when considering the best interests of a child: Jordan v. Jordan , 2001 BCSC 1058 at para. 20
6.  joint guardianship with no ultimate decision-maker may not be appropriate on the basis that the cost and delay of applying to court each time the parents cannot agree is not warranted. Ultimately a decision has to be made. In such circumstances, the primary caregiver is best able to make the decision after making an effort to seek a consensus with the other parent: Andrew-Reed v. Reed , 2002 BCSC 513 at paras. 17-18
7.  a particular parent's understanding of the general and special needs of a child, such as autism spectrum disorders, is a factor

which can be taken into account with respect to custody, guardianship, where the primary residence should be and which parent should have the ultimate decision-making power: M.H.K.J. v. K.J.J. , 2011 BCSC 1673 at paras. 78-82

-  final decision-making authority can be ordered in situations to avoid continuing conflict due to the level of acrimony between the parents: S.M.M. v. J.P.H. , 2011 BCSC 1084 at para. 227
-  the Joyce model of guardianship may well be appropriate if the court is satisfied the primary custodial parent will in fact consult and seek the input of the other parent prior to making major decisions: Chin v. Frass , 2011 BCSC 272 at para. 29.

[25]         I expect that other cases have added other considerations, based upon the particular circumstances of the case.  In every case, it is a matter of determining how decisions should be made in the best interests of the child or children, in the particular circumstances. The analysis is inevitably highly context-specific.

[87] In this case, the respondent will be responsible for L.'s care for the majority of the time, and as I have said, he likely has better judgment as to what is in L.'s best interests.  This appears to coincide with Dr. Elterman's opinion. Dr. Elterman recommends primary decision-making authority to the respondent, and I agree.

## 5. Parenting Arrangements - Conclusion

- [88] For the reasons stated above, I order that the parenting schedule recommended by Dr. Elterman be implemented.
- [89] Specifically, he recommended as follows:
- a)  Every week L. would be with the claimant from after school on Thursday until Saturday at 12 noon.
- b)  Every week L. would also be with the claimant from after school on Tuesday until 6:30pm.
- c)  Spring break and Christmas break will be shared equally.  The parent who has the first half of Spring break has the second half of the Christmas break.  This will alternate from year-to-year.

- d)  Summer vacations will be on a week-on and week-off schedule with each parent, exchanging Sundays at 6 p.m.
- e)  On Father's Day and Mother's Day, regardless of where the child is, the appropriate parent will have L. between 11 am and 2 pm.
- f) On L.'s birthday L. will be with the other parent for 3 hours during the day.
- [90] The parties are at liberty to vary this schedule by mutual agreement.
- [91] The revised parenting schedule will be in effect as of October 1, 2019.
- [92] Other aspects of the guardianship and parenting order will be as follows:
- 1)    The parties are joint guardians of L., pursuant to ss. 39 and 51 of the Family Law Act , S.B.C. 2011 c. 25 [ FLA ];
- 2)    The guardians will share all parental responsibilities with respect to L. on the following terms:
- i.       each guardian is obliged to advise the other guardian of any matters of a significant nature affecting L.;
10. ii each guardian is obliged to inform the other guardian of L.'s medical, dental or other professional needs and treatment, and the providers of such treatment;
- iii.      each guardian is obliged to discuss with the other guardian any significant decisions to be made concerning L. including significant decisions about L.'s health (except emergency decisions), education, religious instruction, and general welfare;
- iv.    the guardians are obliged to discuss significant decisions with each other and to endeavour to reach agreement on those decisions;
- v.    in the event that the guardians cannot reach agreement on a significant decision despite their best efforts, the respondent is entitled to make such decisions, and the claimant has the right to apply for directions on any decision she considers contrary to the best interests of L., pursuant to s. 49 of the FLA ; and
- vi.     each guardian will have the right to obtain information concerning L. directly from third parties, including but not limited to teachers, counsellors, medical professionals, treatment providers, or any professional caregivers.

## B. Family Property and Debt

[93] FLA sections 81-87, and 94-97 govern the division of family property and family debt.

[94] The respondent seeks equal division of family property and family debt, after subtracting his claims for excluded property.

[95] The claimant brought no assets into the relationship and claims no exclusions.

[96] The respondent owned the property on Gee Street.  Retrospective appraisal evidence shows that its value when the parties began cohabiting was $400,000. $140,000 was owed on a mortgage.  The net equity was therefore $260,000. He had few other assets: (1) RRSP of $14,998.09 (2) $2,587.61 in a chequing account. He had debts of $96,381.86.  He claims exclusion of the net assets brought into the relationship.  He also claims for exclusion of an inheritance of $16,424.43 from his grandmother's estate received in December 2014.  He claims for exclusion of $182,630.18. Most of this is the equity he had in the Gee Street property.  The property was sold August 17, 2015 for $515,000.  The Spratt Road property was purchased in February 2015 for $438,000.  Substantial renovations were required in order to make it habitable.

[97] At separation, the family property consisted essentially of the Spratt Road property, (valued at $625,000) and RRSPs.  Not including the RRSPs, the assets are valued at $626,159.21.  However, mortgage debt and other family debt amounted to $436,006.79.  Net non-RRSP assets were $190,152.42.

[98] All of these figures are firmly established in the evidence, and are not challenged by the claimant.  The relevant joint property and joint debts are accurately summarized in the tables set out in the respondent's final submissions.

[99] Regrettably the net value of family property (other than the RRSPs) was barely more at separation than what the respondent had when the relationship

began. The net increase is only about $10,000, despite significant increases in the value of both properties.  Clearly, the family was overspending, and financing the overspending by borrowing against the real estate.  As a result, there is not much in the way of net assets to be divided.

- [100] The value of the Spratt Road property has not changed since separation.
- [101] The parties agree that the increase in value of the RRSPs over the course of the relationship was $37,839.60, which should be divided equally, by way of a spousal rollover of $18,919.80 to the claimant.
- [102] The claimant argues that the equity in the Gee Street property was intermingled with the family finances and with the purchase of the Spratt Road property, and that the respondent has failed to establish the exclusion, via tracing of assets.  However tracing in this sense is not required in order to establish an exclusion. In Quicho v. Ranjbar , 2018 BCSC 2135, I stated:
- [29]        In Shih v. Shih , 2017 BCCA 37, the Court of Appeal rejected the idea that the Act requires precision or mathematical certainty in order to establish exclusion of property founded upon tracing from other excluded property.  The Court held that in respect of such claims the standard of proof is the same as in any civil case - proof on a balance of probabilities.  Clear and cogent evidence is required.  If documentary evidence is not available, the party bearing the onus of proof will need to testify as to their recollection of the transactions in dispute.  That evidence will be scrutinized for credibility.  In balancing the evidence as a whole, the trial judge must be permitted to draw reasonable inferences from evidence that is less than certain or precise in order to do justice between the parties.
- [103] In this case the evidence is more than sufficient to establish the exclusions for 'property acquired by a spouse before the relationship…began' [s. 85(1)(a)] and the inheritance [s. 85(1)(b)].
- [104] The claimant also argues that the respondent disposed of farm equipment since separation, and claims for one half of the value of the equipment.  The respondent concedes that he sold equipment worth $36,100 after separation.  He states that he used about $18,200 of this to finance the expert reports in this

litigation (Dr. Elterman, $15,802, and the appraisals).  The order of Master Taylor provides that the cost of Dr. Elterman's report will be divided equally and that the claimant's share will be paid from her equity in the matrimonial property.  The respondent claims for costs of one-half of the s. 211 report and the appraisals, in the amount of $9,213.  The claimant claims for one-half of the value of the equipment sold, or $18,050.  Unequal division in relation to the sold equipment is supported by FLA section 95(2)(g)(ii).  The net assets for division are $17,482.  After adjusting for the value of the equipment and reimbursement for the reports, the respondent will pay the claimant this amount plus $96 for a total of $17,578.  The respondent will retain the title to the Spratt Road property, the farm assets, and will be responsible for paying the joint debts.

[105] The other assets of the parties (furnishings, personal belongings, etc.) are not of any significant monetary value.  The respondent retained most items. He unreasonably withheld photographs of L. wanted by the claimant, and some DVDs that were important to R.

[106] I order that the claimant provide a list of any further items she seeks to have, and that the respondent turn over or provide them, to the limit of equal sharing of all of the family property at the time of separation.  If the parties are unable to agree on the division of personal belongings, I direct an inquiry before the registrar pursuant to Supreme Court Family Rules [ SCFR ] 18-1.  The registrar may certify the result in accordance with SCFR 18-1(2).

## C. Child Support

## 1. Incomes of the Parties

[107] The respondent works as a mechanic with 557317 BC Ltd. dba T-Lane Transportation &amp; Logistics.  He began working for this employer in 2018. Prior to that he worked for Falcon Equipment Ltd., also as a mechanic.  In 2018 he earned employment income of $70,635.97 as shown on his tax return.  He testified that he expects to earn a similar amount of employment income in 2019.  His Financial Statement sworn July 11, 2019 states that his income for child support purposes is

$70,635.  However in submissions, counsel contends that net farm losses of $5,966.48 should be deducted from his income, leaving a net income of $64,669.

- [108] I accept that the farm losses are applicable for 2018 and 2019.  However, persisting in non-income producing endeavours would not be reasonable and the losses could be considered non-deductible under s. 17(2) or s. 19 of the Guidelines .
- [109] I determine the respondent's income for child support purposes at $64,669, at present, and for purposes of retroactive support, or sharing of s. 7 expenses.  (No s. 7 expenses were considered at trial).
- [110] The claimant receives PWD benefits from the Province in the amount of $1,556 per month.  She can earn up to $1,000 per month in addition to this, without a clawback of benefits.  She earns $650 per month cleaning houses.  In addition she cleans for her therapist, Ms. Gowler, in exchange for therapy treatment.  Thus, her current income is $2,206 per month, or $26,472 per annum.
- [111] Her housecleaning income is taxable income.
- [112] The respondent argues that her income should be imputed at a higher amount, pursuant to s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines , as she could clean more houses.
- [113] I discussed the principles of imputation of income under s. 19(1)(a) recently in Neely v. Neely , 2019 BCSC 610 at paras. 111 and 136 to 138, which I incorporate here.
- [114] The respondent argues that the claimant provided no medical evidence regarding the reasons for her receipt of disability benefits, and no reasons for working part time, or of efforts to find other work.  However, the claimant was not challenged on these points at trial.
- [115] The party seeking to have income imputed to the other spouse has the burden of establishing an evidentiary basis for the imputation of income: MacCarthy v. MacCarthy , 2015 BCCA 496, at para. 35.

- [116] The claimant gave ample evidence regarding the state of her mental health, and testified to some physical complaints as well.  She referred to chronic pain.  The respondent relies on her mental health issues to argue for primary parenting. However, in relation to income earning, he seeks to minimize her constraints.
- [117] The fact that she has been in receipt of PWD benefits for many years (interrupted during the relationship with the respondent) is firmly established, and allows me to infer that she met the criteria when she applied and continues to do so.
- [118] The respondent has not established that the claimant is intentionally underemployed within the meaning of s. 19(1)(a) of the Guidelines .  I am not persuaded that the claimant has the capacity to earn more income.
- [119] I determine her income for child support purposes at $26,472 per annum.
- [120] Counsel for the claimant states in submissions that the claimant's PWD benefits could be reduced if she is not the primary custodial parent.  This is not clear on the evidence, which consists of a chart from the Province of B.C.  I must determine the income of the claimant on the basis of the evidence actually before me.

## 2. Retroactive Child Support

- [121] The respondent has not paid child support for L. since separation. He recognizes that the obligation existed.  He testified that he did not pay child support because the parties did not enter into an agreement to pay it.  The claimant's Notice of Family Claim filed within about three weeks of separation sets out a claim for child support.  Failure to pay child support in these circumstances is unreasonable, and in the circumstances of this case, inexcusable.  No agreement was required, as the obligation already existed, as the respondent knew.
- [122] Section 147 of the FLA states that each parent and guardian of a child has a duty to provide support for the child.  Section 149 of the FLA states that a court may make an order requiring a child's parent or guardian to pay child support. The

language of this section is similar to that found in s. 15.1(1) of the Divorce Act . These provisions allow the court to make an order that is effective to enforce obligations that existed prior to the date of the court's order: D.B.S. v. S.R.G. , 2006 SCC 37, at paras. 80 - 84.  The law relating to retroactive child support orders is helpfully reviewed in the decision of Kent J. in Loughlean v. Regehr , 2018 BCSC 1950, at paras. 56 to 75.

- [123] The respondent argues that the claimant ought to have made an application for a court order prior to the trial. I do not agree.  In the circumstances of this case no such application ought to have been required, as the respondent should have fulfilled his legal and moral obligation, immediately upon separation.  Unnecessary applications of this sort should not be encouraged.  The claimant has very limited means.  The conduct of the respondent is blameworthy.
- [124] The respondent is obliged to pay retroactive child support for 20 months, from February 1, 2018 to September 30, 2019.
- [125] The respondent ought to have paid $613.29 per month.  He will pay retroactive child support of $12,265.80.

## 3. Future Child Support

- [126] The claimant will pay child support based upon her income for child support purposes, which I have determined to be $26,472 per annum.  Her current obligation is $228.36 per month.  These payments will commence October 1, 2019.

## IV. CONCLUSION

- [127] Orders are made in accordance with these reasons.
- [128] The respondent has been substantially successful on the issues of parenting, and the division of property and debt.  The claimant succeeded on some other issues, such as retroactive child support, and spousal support, which was settled during trial.  These issues did not absorb as much time at trial, but that was essentially due to the fact that there was less to argue about.  There was no merit to

the respondent's argument against retroactive child support, which ought not to have been litigated.

[129] In my view success has been roughly divided, and so subject to offers to settle in accordance with SCFR 11-1, the parties will bear their own costs.
