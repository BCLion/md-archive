2023 BCPC 110 (CanLII)

## INTRODUCTION

- [1] B. was born on [omitted for publication]. This decision will refer to her as B. to preserve her privacy. Her parents are S.T.M. and C.G.H. (jointly the Parties). S.T.M. is a [omitted for publication]. C.G.H. is an [omitted for publication] who owns and operates a consulting [omitted for publication] firm, [omitted for publication].
- [2] The Parties have long been unable to agree on how they should allocate their parental responsibilities and parenting time with B. Those disagreements resulted in this litigation. It has been protracted, acrimonious and expensive for the Parties, both emotionally and financially. It has been wearing in stressful on them, their families, and their friends. Most importantly, it has had adverse impacts on B.
- [3] B. has several complex, not fully addressed mental health and behavioural issues. Diagnoses of B.'s many challenges over the years include separation anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
- [4] The experts who have assessed or treated B. now agree that she also has Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). That term is used here to describe the condition. ASD is an incurable neurodevelopmental disorder but therapies can help a person better understand their circumstances and develop strategies to assist them in their daily life.
- [5] Over the years, several health care professionals were engaged to ascertain and implement strategies that would benefit B. with her multiple diagnoses. The Parties have been unable to agree on how the various experts' reports and strategies should be implemented in B.'s best interests and what role B. should have in that implementation.

## ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED

- [6] I must resolve the following issues:

- a)  The appropriate parenting arrangements for B., including parenting time and parental responsibilities;
- b)  Whether the Parties will retain additional professionals to assist B, and if so, what those professionals will address;
- c)  Whether S.T.M. has caused parental alienation between B. and C.G.H.;
- d)  Whether S.T.M. has wrongfully withheld B. from C.G.H. during his past parenting time; and
- e)  A determination of retroactive and prospective child support, including special and extraordinary expenses.

## APPROACH TO SUMMARIZING THE EVIDENCE

- [7] In light of the voluminous evidence presented orally, by affidavits, in electronic communications, by video, and through various experts' reports it is important for the Parties and counsel to have an understanding of my approach in reviewing and summarizing the evidence. It is a similar approach to that adopted in R. v. Connell , 2017 BCPC 123, by the Honourable Judge T. Woods where he said at paragraphs 5 and 6:
- [5] … I will candidly acknowledge that in these Reasons for Judgment I have not made reference to all of the testimony given by the witnesses who were called, or to all of the documentary evidence that was received and marked. I have, rather, referred to evidence that I consider necessary to mention in connection with my factual findings and the legal conclusions that flow from them. In places I have made mention of evidence that I have been unable to accept, and of the reasons why I have been unable to accept it. If evidence is not mentioned in this decision, both Crown and defence may take comfort that the omission is not the result of my not having taken note of it. I have read all of the transcripts from end to end. I have done the same with all of the documentary exhibits. If witness testimony or documentary evidence do not come up for specific mention in these reasons that is because:
3. (a) The evidence was not relevant;
4. (b) The evidence is to the same effect as other evidence of which mention has been made; or

- (c) The evidence was tendered in support of alleged facts I have not found and arguments that I have not accepted, having regard to the facts that I have found and the arguments that are supported by those facts.
- [6] That it is an acceptable practice for a trial judge to confine him or herself, in Reasons for Judgment, to a compressed and somewhat selective canvassing of the evidence heard at trial is well established on the authorities. The law is clear that where there is substantial support in the record for a trial judge's findings and the inferences drawn from them, the trial judge does not make a reversible error by failing to refer to every item of evidence that was adduced: [Citations omitted]
- [8] The evidence in this decision is summarized and condensed; sometimes without specific reference to whose evidence it was or from which document it emanated. Where evidence was presented in an affidavit and repeated at trial or described in several places in submissions to support different findings it will be referred to only once.

## PARENTING ARRANGEMENTS

## LIVING SITUATIONS

- [9] Since the Parties' separation, B. has lived primarily with S.T.M. with C.G.H. having shorter periods of parenting time. He contested this parenting time arrangement both before and after the litigation started.
- [10] S.T.M. started a relationship with D.H. in August 2016. They started living together in January 2017 but did not commence conjugal relations until August 2017. D.H.'s two sons, who are slightly younger than B, moved into the home around April 2018 and resided there on a week on week off schedule. S.T.M. and D.H. separated and he and his children left her home in the summer of 2022.
- [11] C.G.H. started a relationship with T.C. in 2018. T.C. has no children.

- [12] There are a number of pets and other animals at both homes but the most important one to B. is her dog, [omitted for publication], who regularly accompanies her as she travels back and forth between the homes. B. has trained [omitted for publication] to be a therapy dog and takes [omitted for publication] to senior residences.

## PRE LITIGATION FAMILY HISTORY

- [15] S.T.M. was born on [omitted for publication] and is now [omitted for publication]. C.G.H. was born on [omitted for publication] and is now [omitted for publication].
- [16] S.T.M. studied criminology at colleges in British Columbia and Ontario but did not complete her degree because she joined the [omitted for publication]. After her training, she transferred to [omitted for publication] where she met C.G.H.
- [17] C.G.H. received a psychology degree from University British Columbia in [omitted for publication]. He taught English at schools in Korea and in Vancouver for four years. For approximately four years, he worked as a youth and childcare counsellor on a team with other professionals assisting youth who came from a troubled background, broken homes or had some form of developmental disability. He moved to [omitted for publication] to start a career as a [omitted for publication] with the [omitted for publication].
- [18] The Parties began a spousal relationship in the summer of 2006 and lived in a home owned by S.T.M. near [omitted for publication]. In [omitted for publication], S.T.M. became pregnant with B. she had a difficult pregnancy with many health issues including many planned and unexpected medical appointments, some brief hospital stays and other medical interventions. She assumed modified duties with the [omitted for publication] but received her regular salary.
- [19] B. was slightly under weight at birth. She cried a lot in her early infancy and got very little sleep. She learned to walk at a young age. S.T.M. remained at home for one year while C.G.H. continued his employment but on an altered schedule.
- [20] The Parties disagree on the level of C.G.H.'s assistance to S.T.M. during the pregnancy and his assumption of household duties during that time and after B.'s birth while S.T.M. was on parental leave. C.G.H. expressed concern about S.T.M. breastfeeding B. until she was almost two years old, claiming that activity interfered with

7

his time with B, it was not natural and resulted in enmeshment between S.T.M. and B. C.G.H. acknowledged to Dr. Aube that he was 'at best a part time dad' during that period.

[21] He also disagreed with S.T.M. frequently co-sleeping with B. until she was about nine years old because he did not think it was healthy. He said that if B. cried or fussed at night S.T.M. would become anxious and would immediately go to her bedroom, often for the whole night.

[22] Around the time of B.'s birth C.G.H. became a [omitted for publication] for northern British Columbia. The Parties disagree about how many days C.G.H. was away from home in that position. S.T.M. maintained he was frequently away throughout the province, often for extended periods, while C.G.H. stated such absences were rare, to close by communities and never exceeded two nights but he acknowledged to Dr. Aube that he was very busy with that position and had to travel 'sometimes up to three days a week around the province'.

[23] C.G.H. said that he resigned from that position after one year so he could spend more time at home. S.T.M. acknowledged that C.G.H. resigned but that did not result in him spending more time with her and B. C.G.H. was also away from home in blocks of time for several months while working as a first-aid attendant at a mine.

[24] S.T.M. said that in B.'s early infancy, the two of them made several extended visits to her parents' home near [omitted for publication], and her sister's home in Prince George so her family could assist with B.'s care. In addition, S.T.M.'s parents were frequent visitors in [omitted for publication] and they assisted with B.'s care. C.G.H. discounted the frequency, lengths and purpose of these visits.

[25] C.G.H.'s parents lived in a community close to [omitted for publication] but S.T.M. described them as having only infrequent and limited contact with B. in her early infancy. There was a tentative arrangement that C.G.H.'s parents would provide childcare for B. when S.T.M. returned to work but on the eve of that happening, the

arrangement fell through. S.T.M. said it was because C.G.H.'s parents decided they did not have the energy, while C.G.H. maintained that a dispute arose between his parents and S.T.M.'s parents causing her to terminate the arrangement.

- [26] S.T.M. secured childcare for B. with the spouse of one of her co-workers but that required a daily total commute of 80 kilometres to get her there. S.T.M. said that she did all the driving but C.G.H. disagreed with that assertion saying that he did some of the driving. That arrangement continued until S.T.M. moved from [omitted for publication].

[27] When she first returned to work, S.T.M. was on general duty but she transferred to [omitted for publication], so she would not have to work night shifts. She said that whenever she was at work, B. would be in childcare even when C.G.H. was not working and at home. S.T.M. said that C.G.H. did not fully participate in household chores and other duties in B.'s younger years but that he did participate on occasion and occasionally took B. to the doctor or dentist. C.G.H. disputed that contention maintaining he was equally involved in all aspects of parenting verified by numerous photographs in evidence.

[28] C.G.H. wanted to move from [omitted for publication]. The Parties discussed C.G.H.'s career plans and he decided to attend university. In [omitted for publication], C.G.H. moved to Prince George to attend the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC). His original intention was to pursue medicine studies but he changed to study [omitted for publication]. During his first term, C.G.H. lived in Prince George during the week and returned to [omitted for publication] on some weekends.

[29] In [omitted for publication], S.T.M. obtained a compassionate transfer to Prince George that also provided additional career opportunities for her. When S.T.M. was working, B. attended UNBC's day care program and she had the assistance of her sister. C.G.H. said he often dropped B. off at day care before going to class and picked her up at the end of the day if B. was not in an activity, in which case her aunt or

another caregiver would pick her up. S.T.M. contended that C.G.H.'s participation in transporting B. to day care was sporadic.

- [30] S.T.M. said that even if he had a day off, C.G.H. would take B. to day care and on many weekends where S.T.M. was working and C.G.H. was at home he would take B. to her aunt's so he could focus on his studies. C.G.H. disputed that claim.
- [31] When B. was approximately three years old and attending day care, she started showing signs of anxiety.  At the time, both S.T.M. and, to a lesser extent, C.G.H. viewed B's behaviours as personality 'quirks.'
- [32] S.T.M. said that B. had a very upsetting reaction to fire alarms that required additional work by her and the day care to lessen B.'s anxieties. C.G.H. did not assist in this area. B.'s anxieties around fire alarms persisted into her later childhood. She expressed to S.T.M. fear of being burned in a fire and would cry.
- [33] C.G.H. did not agree that B. had problems with fire alarms. He said he was a [omitted for publication] and S.T.M. is a [omitted for publication] and B. was exposed to sirens. He did not agree that B. was suffering anxiety as a result of the fire alarms at the day care or subsequently.
- [34] In [omitted for publication], S.T.M. went to Ottawa for a two-month [omitted for publication] course to qualify as a [omitted for publication]. During that time, S.T.M. said B. was cared for by C.G.H. and her sister, while C.G.H. said he was practically B's only caregiver.
- [35] S.T.M. said that as an [omitted for publication], she would occasionally be called out at night and on weekends and whenever that occurred she would have her sister or third party care for B. because C.G.H. was working hard on his university studies.
- [36] C.G.H. said that while S.T.M. was taking her [omitted for publication] training he was able to almost completely toilet train B. but when S.T.M. returned she continued to

wipe B.'s bottom and that behaviour continued until B. was nine years old even though he objected to it. He said that B. and S.T.M. had a code so S.T.M. would know when B. wanted assistance in the bathroom. After the separation when B. was at his home he insisted that she attend to her own personal hygiene and that upset her.

[37] S.T.M. agreed that B. was potty trained very easily but insisted that she have a clean bottom. However, she would sometimes soil herself while at day care. B. disclosed she did not like using the bathroom there because there were no doors on the stalls. That issue was resolved through the combined efforts of S.T.M. and the day care without any assistance from C.G.H. S.T.M. subsequently attributed B.'s continuing hygiene issues to her later diagnosed ASD.

[38] Starting in the summer of [omitted for publication], C.G.H.'s [omitted for publication] education involved considerable fieldwork that took him away from Prince George, often for many days at a time. His absences required further adjustments to B.'s care regime involving an additional third party who worked at the day care. This summer work and childcare arrangement continued until the end of the summer of 2013.

[39] In July 2012, S.T.M. was pregnant but miscarried. C.G.H. was in the field and returned to be with S.T.M. He only remained a short time before returning to work. S.T.M. said that C.G.H.'s lack of support greatly distressed her and the relationship began to founder.

[40] In the summer of 2013, C.G.H. found out that S.T.M. was having an affair. He left his job but continued his studies. The Parties started marriage counselling. C.G.H. said that he also stopped drinking wine because it seemed to upset S.T.M. even though he was not a heavy consumer. S.T.M. was not a drinker. After a few sessions, S.T.M. stopped attending the marriage counselling.

[41] In September [omitted for publication], B. began Kindergarten. The Parties participated in getting B. to school and a caregiver was hired to pick her up after school,

care for her and take her to arranged activities. S.T.M. said B. was very anxious about starting Kindergarten. She seemed to have difficulty adapting to change and it required considerable effort on S.T.M. and the teacher's part to help B. overcome those fears.

[42] That winter B. also expressed a fear of getting her tongue stuck on a metal pole at school. S.T.M. worked with B. to overcome those fears. She said that both she and C.G.H. continued to attribute that behaviour to B.'s personality quirks. C.G.H. attributed S.T.M.'s many visits to the Kindergarten to her insistence in wiping B.'s bottom. He did not recall S.T.M. raising any major concerns about B.'s anxieties at that time.

- [43] S.T.M. said that although the diagnoses of B's. mental health challenges were not until 2018, she noticed as early as 2011 that B. exhibited a number of unusual behaviours. She spoke to C.G.H. about them but he described them as quirks or odd behaviours. When they became more pronounced, C.G.H. dismissed them and criticized her for raising them, telling her that she did not know what she was talking about and that his experience as a paramedic and working with youth gave him better insight to the situation.
- [44] C.G.H. denied belittling S.T.M., calling her dumb or stupid, that her concerns had no merit or saying that she was making things up. He also did not tell her that he knew better because he knew better as a [omitted for publication], had a degree in psychology or that he had worked as a child counsellor.
- [45] The Parties separated in early summer 2014 when C.G.H. found out that S.T.M. was continuing her affair. C.G.H. moved out of the home immediately. He first went to [omitted for publication] to advise S.T.M.'s parents about the situation where he had a verbal confrontation with her father, R.M. He then went to stay with friends for a short period.
- [46] C.G.H. sought counselling assistance and obtained a prescription from his doctor to address his mental health that he took for approximately three months. He said he

obtained permission from UNBC to delay his Master's thesis so he could find work and a place to live.

- [47] C.G.H. continued his fieldwork and continued to be away for extended periods. He rented a basement room in a home where several other men lived. He said he did not feel it was an appropriate place to have overnight parenting time with B. but that S.T.M. brought her over to visit with him when he was home on weekends. S.T.M. said that C.G.H.'s parenting time with B. during that time was limited to occasional weekends because he was often absent for work until November 2015 when he moved into his first home in a rural area outside of Prince George.
- [48] S.T.M. said both prior to and in the immediate months following their separation she was the parent primarily responsible for B.'s day-to-day care because C.G.H. was often away from home for school or for work or pursuing his studies to complete his education. The sporadic nature of C.G.H.'s parenting time with B. was very troubling to B. Due to her mental health challenges consistency and routine in scheduling was, and remains, very important to her health and well-being.

## SEPARATION AGREEMENT

- [49] In November 2014, the Parties entered into the Agreement drafted by C.G.H. after he consulted with the Internet and some lawyers by phone. It dealt with all aspects of the dissolution of the spousal relationship. The terms of B.'s continuing care and child support included:

## PARENTING ARRANGEMENT

7. The Parties agree that joint legal guardianship is in the best interest of the child. The Parties agree that both parents are fit and proper persons to have joint responsibility for the care of the dependent child.
8. The Parties agree that the child will reside with both parents.
9. The Parties also agree that the Parties will have the following parenting time with the Child: 50/50 share with specific arrangements for weekdays,

holidays, vacations and weekends to be determined and agreed upon by both Parties at a later date.

## CHILD SUPPORT

10. Neither parent will pay child support unless agreed to, and amended in a subsequent separation agreement.
11. The Parties will pay the cost of childcare and special and extraordinary expenses generally 50/50 ratio but in proportion to their respective incomes. For example, if one parent earns 30% more than the other than that parent will pay 30% more of the childcare expenses.
12. The Parties agree that each will provide the other a copy of their income tax returns and any notices of assessment and reassessment issue, on an annual basis, until the child reaches the age of 19 years.
- [50] S.T.M. said that C.G.H. insisted the Agreement have equal parenting time because he did not want to pay any child support although he acknowledged to her that he would not be able to care for B. on an equal basis because of his fieldwork. She did not do any research nor get any legal advice prior to signing the Agreement and accepted what C.G.H. said about equal parenting time. She agreed to those terms because C.G.H. told her that he would smear her name with her family, friends and coworkers regarding her affair and because she believed that equal parenting would be in B.'s best interests.
- [51] C.G.H. said he did not threaten or coerce S.T.M. in any way to sign the Agreement and that her friends and family already knew about the affair. He knew he would be absent a great deal in the summer months but that he would have more time with B. in the winter months.
- [52] C.G.H. paid no regular monthly child support until the litigation commenced but each Party contributed to B.'s expenses as described in the Agreement.

## EARLY POST SEPARATION PARENTING

[53] Starting in September 2014 and continuing until November 2017, S.T.M. had a boarder who helped care for B. and ensure she got to school on time when S.T.M. was working. After school, the caregiver picked B. up and took her to her activities.

[54] S.T.M. said that in the summers of 2014 and 2015, C.G.H. was very busy with his field work and in the winter months he worked hard on completing his Master's thesis so did not have a lot of time for B.

[55] S.T.M. said that C.G.H.'s infrequent, sporadic and often unplanned parenting time with B. had a detrimental effect on B. and she displayed anger, frustration and anxiety when presented with surprise or unplanned events. She tried to explain those concerns and made suggestions to assist B. to C.G.H. but he ignored her.

[56] C.G.H. maintained that S.T.M. was very cooperative in ensuring he had time with B. when he was available and that he and B. would do things together including rock climbing, bicycle riding, riding ATVs, going swimming and activities at places including the museum. S.T.M. said she encouraged C.G.H. to take B. rock climbing because she did not enjoy it. For a time C.G.H.'s brother Tom lived with him. He was a ski instructor who taught B. to ski, an activity she enjoys.

[57] S.T.M. said that she kept C.G.H. informed of B.'s activities by sending photographs of her swimming, playing soccer and the like. C.G.H. insisted on having B. for Christmas 2015 and that was arranged.

[58] C.G.H. said that on many weekends, B. would come to his home with S.T.M. who would remain overnight and they enjoyed conjugal relations. He said that pattern continued well into 2016. He was wary of her intentions given her previous affair but he believed they might be working towards reconciliation. He was unaware that S.T.M. had started a relationship with D.H.

[59] C.G.H. told S.T.M. that he wanted to have more time with B. without her being present. She agreed, but continued to come to his home unannounced during his

parenting time. Later S.T.M. began to often send B. to his home with a friend or cousin. He concluded that S.T.M.'s actions were meant to undermine his regular requests for equal parenting time.

- [60] C.G.H. said that B. started to become reluctant to spend time with him without S.T.M. being present. On many occasions, B. confided in him that she missed S.T.M. and was worried that S.T.M. would 'die of a broken heart.'
- [61] C.G.H. said that around the same time S.T.M. advised him that it was B.'s choice not to increase parenting time with him and that she intended to respect B.'s wishes over his objections that B. should not be given a choice in the matter and it should be resolved between the Parties.
- [62] S.T.M. said that at that time she never told B. that she had any choice about spending time with C.G.H. and she always encouraged B. to spend time with him when he requested it.
- [63] In January 2016, she proposed to C.G.H. a scheduled care regime to lessen B.'s anxieties about surprises and lack of advance knowledge of her routine but C.G.H. ignored her proposal. Throughout 2016, B.'s adverse behaviours surrounding her time with C.G.H. became even more pronounced and worrisome.
- [64] S.T.M. said she corresponded regularly with C.G.H. describing her observations and concerns about B. but he either ignored her or said she was making things up. C.G.H. said that both he and S.T.M. recognized that B. was showing signs of anxiety that needed to be addressed.

## The Chicken Coop Incident

- [65] In June 2016, B.'s behaviours and her reluctance to spend time with C.G.H. became even more pronounced. B. told S.T.M. that on one occasion at C.G.H.'s she

had left the gate to the chicken coop open. When he discovered that, C.G.H. told her that if she did that again he would cut off the chickens' heads in front of her.

[66] Soon after the incident, S.T.M. reported to C.G.H. that B. was wetting the bed and showing signs of great anxiety. S.T.M. said she contacted C.G.H. to find out what happened, suggested a meeting to discuss that and other issues, that they implement a schedule for B.'s time with him and that C.G.H. phone B. on a regular schedule. She got no reply to that email.

- [67] C.G.H. said that he explained to B. the importance of making sure to close the gate to chicken coop to prevent his guardian dogs from attacking the chickens. B. appeared to understand but not long after she left the gate open and the dogs almost got to the chickens. He was very upset and shouted at B.
- [68] He did not say he would kill the chickens in front of her or anything like that. He explained that if the dog got into the chicken coop they would all be dead. After the incident, S.T.M. told him that B. was reluctant to come to his home on the weekends when he returned from his fieldwork. He believed his reaction to the incident may have initiated or exacerbated some of B.'s anxieties and he feels badly about that.
- [69] S.T.M. said that the incident and C.G.H.'s response, as B. interpreted it, remains a continued source of anxiety and concern for B. Dr. Ambrose confirmed that B. still displays anxiety when talking about the incident.
- [70] C.G.H. said that the incident occurred at the same time S.T.M. was starting her relationship with D.H. which B. and S.T.M. never told him about and that deception increased B.'s anxieties.

## SUMMER 2016

- [71] S.T.M. said that in the summer months of 2016 and 2017, C.G.H. was often away for up to 10 days at a time doing [omitted for publication] fieldwork.

- [72] In the summer of 2016, S.T.M. purchased a new home and soon after suggested to C.G.H. that they exchange B. at a neutral location. C.G.H. said that he had only been to S.T.M.'s home on a few occasions and he did not know why she was reluctant to have him come there but that she was very evasive when he would ask questions about what was going on in her home. She also asked him to stop asking any questions of B. about what went on in her home even though he was not doing anything more than making general inquiries about what was going on in B.'s life. He said that B. became even more reluctant to come to his home without confirming everything with S.T.M.
- [73] S.T.M. said in the fall of 2016, a plan was implemented with B. spending one weekend night and Tuesday after school at C.G.H.'s and that prior to that happening both she and C.G.H. would set out for B. what was planned for that time to make her more comfortable. For a while, B. was accepted that approach and some of her worrisome behaviours diminished.
- [74] C.G.H. said that in the fall of 2016, he purchased an iPad for B. and after that B. began to contact S.T.M. more and more often when she was with him. At first he did not discourage that behaviour but he became more concerned when B.'s contacting S.T.M. after almost everything she did at his home became routine.
- [75] S.T.M. said that B. has always had difficulty sleeping but that became worse in the fall of 2016 when she began to express fear that because she could not sleep, she would die. In addition, B. complained of symptoms of bladder infection, began vomiting and having diarrhoea. When she brought those concerns to C.G.H.'s attention, he brushed her off.
- [76] She consulted a number of medical practitioners in 2016 and 2017 to see if there was some organic basis for B.'s symptoms and behaviours but nothing was found. For most of that time, C.G.H. was dismissive of her concerns but by August 2017, he agreed that B. should see a counsellor.

[77] C.G.H. said that B. did have some difficulty falling asleep from time to time at his home but he was able to help her to do so. He did not notice that she had any fears about not being able to fall asleep or that she had the other symptoms when she was with him.

[78] In 2016, S.T.M. suggested to C.G.H. that he reach out to B. on a regular basis. C.G.H. said he tried that for a considerable time but B. did not respond. He felt that S.T.M. was trying to track what arrangements he was making with B. for their time together.

[79] B. told S.T.M. that she was upset about the type of and the volume of the movies at C.G.H.'s home. S.T.M. relayed those concerns to C.G.H. but B. continued to complain. B. also complained about C.G.H.'s alcohol consumption, saying that he drank heavily and drank in the hot tub. S.T.M. asked C.G.H. if he would consider refraining from alcohol when he had B.

- [80] C.G.H. said that he and T.C. consume alcohol, mostly wine, in moderation. He cannot drink more wine than that or he will get migraine headaches. He also stopped consuming alcohol in the hot tub. When B. was much younger, he would drink wine while studying and would dispose of the bottles the next day. He never hid any bottles anywhere in the house to hide his drinking. B. has never told him she is uncomfortable with him drinking in her presence.
- [81] S.T.M. said she and B. slept over at C.G.H.'s home in 2016 and 2017 to take care of his animals when he was absent. On some of those trips, S.T.M. said B. expressed some fear of going there but would not say why.
- [82] S.T.M. said her and C.G.H.'s sexual relationship ended in late 2016. She went over to his home during the Christmas season of 2016 for some specific activities to try to show B. that they could still get along as a family but she was not there to have sex with C.G.H. C.G.H. said that he and S.T.M. maintained a conjugal relationship well past the time she began her relationship with D.H.

## 2017

[83] B.'s fears and anxieties increased and she became so agitated she could not sleep and then would vomit because she was fearful that she would not get enough sleep and would die of exhaustion. C.G.H. said he recognized B.'s anxiety issues but said he saw no signs of her vomiting, having diarrhoea or having sleep difficulties.

[84] In the summer of 2017 while B. was with C.G.H., she called S.T.M. 26 times in one 10-minute period when S.T.M. was out of cell range. B. was distraught and was convinced S.T.M. was dead. After that, S.T.M. determined that she could never be out of cell range when B. was not with her.

[85] In 2017, B.'s activities included swimming, piano, yoga, French tutoring and her counselling sessions. C.G.H. did not express any concerns about those activities. S.T.M. said that B. complained C.G.H. was not helping her with her French homework and that he told her he was letting her do it at S.T.M.'s home. She said that at that time C.G.H. insisted that any of B.'s activities must occur on her parenting time.

[86] C.G.H. said that S.T.M. would not communicate with him in advance to discuss in what activities B. participated. Rather, she would engage B. in those activities and then send him a list of what they were and that he had to ensure B. attended them during his parenting time.

[87] C.G.H. said that in 2016 and 2017, his communication with S.T.M. had some difficulties but they were communicating regularly. However, he began to realize that instead of him and S.T.M. acting as parents and trying to solve situations involving B. cooperatively S.T.M. and B. became closer. He was cut out of many conversations and decisions but was left to deal with problems that S.T.M. said B. was having.

[88] In her emails, S.T.M. regularly described his time with B. in a negative fashion and that B. had negative thoughts about spending time with him. When he was with B.

they had a good time and enjoy each other's company. There was separation anxiety in B. but largely because of S.T.M.'s actions.

[89] There were occasions when B. told S.T.M. that she missed C.G.H. When they occurred, S.T.M. said she contacted C.G.H. and they tried to arrange time for him and B. to spend time together as soon as possible. In the summer of 2017, C.G.H. expressed a wish to spend more time with B. The Parties had discussions on how that could occur but B. continued to have difficulties with anxiety and her time with C.G.H. so, in August 2017, they agreed to engage a counsellor.

## Ms. Janice Butler

[90] The first counsellor hired to help B. was Ms. Janice Butler (Ms. Butler). From August 2017 until November 2017, there were seven or eight sessions with her. Ms. Butler did not give evidence at the trial.

[91] Ms. Butler suggested that B. would benefit from more time with C.G.H. and a schedule of increased and scheduled parenting time for C.G.H. commenced with two overnights per week, usually Mondays and Fridays. That continued until May 2018 when C.G.H. cancelled the Monday overnights when he started his summer fieldwork. S.T.M. said that the change upset her because B. was just getting used to the new schedule but B. expressed happiness that she did not have to go to C.G.H.'s as often.

[92] C.G.H. said that after several sessions Ms. Butler suggested that the bond between him and B. was much weaker than the bond between B. and S.T.M. She suggested that he and S.T.M. should work on reducing B's reliance on her and that both of them should work on enhancing B.'s relationship and bonding with him to include increasing his parenting time to three nights per week.

[93] He said that Ms. Butler told the Parties that B.'s anxiety was related to S.T.M.'s own anxiety issues. It was soon after that that S.T.M. said she wanted to find a new counsellor. C.G.H. said that Ms. Butler was discharged because S.T.M. did not like the advice they were receiving. S.T.M. said that they jointly agreed not to continue with Ms.

Butler because she was not a registered psychologist and as such, S.T.M.'s extended health plan would not pay her fees.

[94] S.T.M. disagreed with Ms. Butler's view that there was nothing wrong with B. that more time at C.G.H.'s could not resolve when, from her experience, B. was having great difficulties. In retrospect, given B.'s various subsequent diagnoses, Ms. Butler was wrong in her analysis.

[95] C.G.H. had one final session with Ms. Butler after the joint relationship ended. He said Ms. Butler suggested that S.T.M.'s relationship with B. was one of 'enmeshment', where S.T.M. was acting as a co-dependent to B. and that without some work, B. would not become her own person and personality.

## 2018

[96] On January 15, 2018, S.T.M. filed an Application to Obtain an Order seeking guardianship, contact with B., parenting time, allocation of parental responsibilities and a protection order. On the same date, S.T.M. filed an affidavit requesting a change in the parenting time from what was in the Agreement until B. was assessed, treated by a child psychologist and a Section 211 Family Law Act (FLA) report was prepared. The affidavit alleged, that despite the Agreement, C.G.H.'s parenting time with B. had been sporadic and at his convenience. On January 31, 2018, S.T.M. withdrew the Application.

[97] S.T.M. said there was an incident in January 2018 where, after helping to buy a birthday cake and present for C.G.H., B., at the last minute, refused to go to his home as arranged and locked herself in her bedroom. That resulted in a heated exchange between the Parties. S.T.M. alleged C.G.H. told her that he would take B. and S.T.M. would never see her again. Soon after that incident B. told S.T.M. that she did not want to go to C.G.H.'s because he pinched her bottom and her nipples, he would watch her in the shower and he insisted she clean her private parts with her hand.

## Dr. Ambrose

[98] S.T.M. researched other possible professionals to assist with B.'s behaviours and found Dr. Ambrose. C.G.H. agreed to engage Dr. Ambrose and she began working with B. in January 2018. C.G.H. said he was in favour of the move because of Dr. Ambrose's greater education and experience in dealing with children of separated parents. Her involvement with B. and the Parties is detailed elsewhere.

[99] Starting in early 2018, B. became less resistant to spending time with C.G.H. and eventually voluntarily agreed to spend time with him including additional times scheduled on short notice. In May 2018, C.G.H. suspended his Monday night parenting time for the summer because of his fieldwork.

[100] In the summer of 2018, C.G.H. asked S.T.M. if she and B. would monitor his time in the field and that he could report in each day by satellite phone. S.T.M. agreed and C.G.H. felt it would be beneficial to help B. remember whom her father was and that he was out working in the field.

[101] C.G.H. said that beginning in 2018, although his available time was truncated during the summer due to his fieldwork, he was available approximate 42% of the time. S.T.M. resisted him having additional time with B. He could not recall whether he believed that routine and consistency was important for B. at that time because her ASD had not been diagnosed.

[102] S.T.M. said that in the fall of 2018 when C.G.H. wanted to return to the previous schedule, B. was very resistant and started to exhibit a number of her previous anxiety behaviours of crying, not sleeping and breaking down. However, after considerable encouragement from her, B. did spend her parenting time with C.G.H.

[103] Around this time, S.T.M. told C.G.H. that she was having difficulty with getting B. into the car to travel to the exchange location. C.G.H. said that he could not understand

what that problem was because whenever B. was with him they had a lot of fun and she seemed to enjoy their time together.

[104] Although B. was making progress in 2018 with Dr. Ambrose's help, S.T.M. said that near Halloween that year B. had a complete unravelling over a fear that S.T.M. was going to sell or give her to an orphanage. That lasted for about a week but B. seemed to come out of it. C.G.H. said he was unaware of that episode until it was revealed at trial.

[105] S.T.M. had earlier suggested using a Family Justice Counsellor (FJC) but it was late fall of 2018 when C.G.H. went to see them. He said that he was not getting very much parenting time although all the experts had suggested equal parenting time.

[106] C.G.H. said that after his initial meeting with the FJC he made a complaint to the Ministry of Child and Family Development (MCFD) about S.T.M. continuing to wipe B.'s bottom given that she was now 10. MCFD told him that they did not deal with matters like that because it was not a matter of imminent harm. MCFD told him that the FJC had reported the same matter. S.T.M. said that both Parties wiped B.'s bottom until approximately 2018. She acknowledged that is unusual but attributed B.'s needs in that regard to her later diagnosed ASD.

## 2019

[107] On January 29, 2019, S.T.M. filed another Application to Obtain an Order seeking guardianship, contact with B., parenting time, allocation of parental responsibilities and child support retroactive to July 1, 2014. On the same date, S.T.M. filed an affidavit similar in content to her January 15, 2018 affidavit but with the addition of child support issues.

[108] The meetings between C.G.H., S.T.M. with the FJC resulted in a draft Memorandum of Understanding, dated March 5, 2019, which provided C.G.H. with an extra hour of parenting time with B. On the very first time that was to occur, B. phoned him in tears saying she did not want to come.

- [109] After that incident there was to be another meeting with the FJC to discuss matters further. C.G.H. attended but S.T.M. did not. C.G.H. said S.T.M. was avoiding the counselling sessions because she did not like what they were suggesting for his parenting time. S.T.M. said she advised the FJC of her unavailability on the scheduled day. C.G.H. did not get that information and no steps were taken after that.
- [110] On March 13, 2019, C.G.H. filed a Reply opposing the relief sought in the Application and counterclaiming for parenting time, child support and cancellation or reduction of any arrears of child support. On April 3, 2019, S.T.M. filed a Reply to the Counterclaim opposing the relief sought by C.G.H.
- [111] In the spring of 2019, C.G.H. took B. to Vancouver and they went to the aquarium and Science World. He reported that B. had a good time and there were no major issues. S.T.M. said that although B. had good moments on that trip she talked more about that she was upset that C.G.H. and T.C. were arguing. At one point B. became very agitated and anxious and threw up in the taxi and that she had a cold but C.G.H. and W.C. would not help her.
- [112] In early 2019, Dr. Ambrose suggested that S.T.M. start making small changes in her home so things were not always exactly the same to assist B. in adapting to different situations, in part, to accommodate the differences between the Parties' homes. That continued until B.'s ASD was diagnosed when it was decided to return to a more predictable arrangement.
- [113] In 2019, Dr. Ambrose made a number of recommendations to the Parties of work to be done with B. to address her OCD symptoms. C.G.H. said he followed the direction of Dr. Ambrose in that regard and after several months, Dr. Ambrose reported to him that B.'s OCD symptoms had diminished considerably.
- [114] C.G.H. said that although S.T.M. and D.H. had been living together since January 2017 he did not find out about it until the summer of 2019 when Dr. Ambrose mentioned it in passing. She thought that he already knew about that living situation.

Although he communicated with S.T.M. about D.H. and their relationship, he was not told that they were living together as a family.

[115] He believes that many of B.'s anxieties during that time arose from her having to lie about her living situation in S.T.M.'s home. He also believes that S.T.M. encouraged B. not to disclose her family situation to him. C.G.H. said that after Dr. Ambrose spoke to B. and advised her that he knew about the stepparent family B. seemed to release a lot of anxiety, was a lot more affectionate and much happier for a while.

[116] S.T.M. initially said that she had told C.G.H. about D.H. around the time he moved in. Later she said she was unaware that she had to disclose to C.G.H. the living arrangements in her home and now that she was aware of that situation, she would do so in the future.

- [117] In 2019, C.G.H.'s parenting time with B. was four overnights per month and every Tuesday. However, B. became resistant to the Tuesdays.
- [118] C.G.H. said that his parenting time with B. was further reduced and when he questioned S.T.M. about that, she insisted that it was B.'s choice and that she would always back up B.'s choices to which he responded that B. should not be making parenting decisions. He said S.T.M. repeated that position many times since the separation.

[119] In May 2019, C.G.H. and T.C. purchased a home together in a rural area in the city. S.T.M. said B. had a lot of difficulty adjusting to that move and started to fall apart so she contacted Dr. Ambrose for advice and assistance. B. wanted to pick out her room at C.G.H.'s new home but was told the room she selected was going to be C.G.H.'s office. There were also disagreements about what colour she could paint her room in his home and an interior decorator was consulted and rejected B.'s choice of colours as being too overwhelming.

[120] C.G.H. said that the room B. selected was not a safe place for a bedroom due to egress issues in the case of a fire so he asked B. to make another choice that she agreed to without any complaint. He took many steps to make B.'s bedroom area more comfortable for her by in many ways imitating what she has at S.T.M.'s home and renovating a bathroom to her tastes. This was done to help with B.'s sleep difficulties. When B. is at his home, he regularly asks her in the morning how she has slept the night before and in most cases she reports that she is sleeping reasonably well.

- [121] In the summer of 2019, C.G.H. took B. to the Okanagan on vacation. S.T.M. said although B. enjoyed some activities that she was upset because she said she was forced play beer pong and she was told she was putting on too much sunscreen so it was taken away from her. She told S.T.M. that the sunscreen smelled like S.T.M. and she liked that so she put it on.
- [122] C.G.H. said that B. along with some other children were playing what they called 'beer pong' but played it with fruit juices and soft drinks. At one point B. was putting on so much sunscreen others at the gathering became concerned and intervened.
- [123] B. said she enjoyed when she and T.C. were studying about the Ogopogo phenomenon but she was upset when C.G.H. told her that Ogopogo was not real. When B. returns from a vacation that has some positive aspects but is otherwise negative from her perspective S.T.M. said she tries to focus on the positive aspects to reassure B. that she had a good time.

## FAMILY CASE CONFERENCE ORDER

- [124] On August 26, 2019 the Parties attended a Family Case Conference (FCC) and entered into an Interim Consent Order for C.G.H.'s parenting time with B. which included:
- a)  Every Friday from after school until Saturday at 6:00 PM;

- b)  One Sunday in September, two in October and three in November and every month thereafter from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM;
- c)  Every Tuesday from after school until 6:00 PM; and
- d)  Other times as may be agreed between them. (the FCC Order)

[125] C.G.H. said that he agreed to the terms of FCC Order although he wanted more parenting time because he saw it as a starting point. He said that up to that time his parenting time with B. was considerably less than what the FCC Order provided.

[126] For a short time, the new schedule under the FCC Order went well with Parties communicating with B. in advance, about what would be happening during her time with C.G.H. S.T.M. said that did not last long and when she attempted to get C.G.H. to continue to provide advance information so she could preload B. he did not do so.

- [127] Early in the 2019 school year, B. refused to go to school one day. S.T.M. said that with the assistance of the vice principal, the counsellor and the aboriginal support worker they made B. feel more comfortable in the classroom and immediately before the transition to C.G.H.'s home on Tuesdays and Fridays. B. continued to have Tuesday and Friday/Saturday parenting time with C.G.H. with some complaints but few issues because the transition occurred directly from school.
- [128] After the FCC, B. complained to S.T.M. that she did not like going to C.G.H.'s home and that she did not feel safe there. She also expressed to S.T.M. her frustrations that C.G.H. simply refused to listen to her about what she wished to do or not to do and he called her a liar.
- [129] C.G.H. said that in September 2019, without consulting him, S.T.M. sent him emails outlining B.'s schedule of extracurricular activities. He did not think S.T.M. should be able to arrange activities for B. during his parenting time and he and B. should consult about what activities they would do together during his time with her.

[130] In the fall of 2019, B. had dance lessons on Friday nights when C.G.H. had her and he took her to those lessons. He enjoyed the dance lessons. B. convinced a friend to go to the dance lessons with her. B. participated in a Christmas dance recital and after the recital, there was a gingerbread making party that B. enjoyed.

[131] There were some occasions in the fall of 2019 where B. would complain of a migraine, decide not to go with C.G.H. and caught the bus to S.T.M.'s home without either Party knowing in advance. S.T.M. agreed that on occasions when B. had migraine headaches, C.G.H. had over-the-counter medicines on hand and that with his medical knowledge as a paramedic he could have easily dealt with B.'s symptoms.

[132] On another occasion in the fall of 2019, B. refused to go to C.G.H.'s home for the scheduled parenting time. According to S.T.M., B. was upset, angry, crying and vomiting and she supported B.'s decision not to go because she felt that more important to stabilize her physical and mental health. She said that she would always do so in B.'s best interest.

[133] S.T.M. said that she constantly encourages B. to spend time with C.G.H. through discussion, and, on occasions, bribery. Even when B. does not physically resist she often complains about having to go.

[134] S.T.M. said that when she tells C.G.H. that B. chooses not to go on certain times it is not her giving B. the choice but it is simply advising C.G.H. that B. is refusing to go despite her best efforts to make it happen. She has never told B. that she has the right to choose. B. obtained that information from other children she knows that they were permitted choose.

[135] S.T.M. denied interfering with C.G.H.'s time or discouraging B. from seeing him but she sent several emails to C.G.H. in 2019 indicating that it was 'up to her [B.]' to decide if she wanted to see him. One read, in part:

'It is and always will be [B.'s] choice as to what/where she wants to be. I will support her choice, whichever it is, 100%.'

[B.] has been made available every Friday except for one (our 6th annual water sliding extravaganza). If she chooses not to visit with you it is/was her choice alone. I will always support her decisions and feelings'.

'She know (sic) I encourage she goes and that's why I am here!!! I'm not going to fight her once here. She does have a say. She does because of her age.'

## Sunday Issues

- [136] The Sunday day visits were unsuccessful almost immediately. S.T.M. said each Sunday was a big fight with B. to get her out of the house and into the car to go to the exchange location because she refused to go to C.G.H.'s. She sent many communications to C.G.H. pointing out the problem and proposed that C.G.H. have B. From Friday night until Sunday afternoon rather than having the exchange on Saturday evening and Sunday morning but he did not respond.
- [137] C.G.H. said that after the FCC Order S.T.M. contacted him about changing the parenting time but that it would have resulted in him having less time with B. so he rejected her proposal. He did not make any counter proposal.
- [138] C.G.H. said that when he did not obtain his parenting time, particularly on Sundays, he would explain to S.T.M. and B. that both The Report and the FCC Order, to which S.T.M. consented, provided him with more parenting time but that she was not complying.
- [139] S.T.M., and later D.H., took B. to every Sunday exchange as required by the FCC Order. S.T.M. said that once they arrived at the exchange location and B. refused to get out of the car C.G.H. did very little, if anything to get B. to go with him but accused her of letting B. decide. She suggested to C.G.H. that he remove B. from her car but he declined to do so.

[140] C.G.H. said on the Sunday exchanges R.M. or D.H. would never tell B. to get out of the car or encourage B. to go with him. Often they would just drive up and not even pull into a parking space. B. would roll down the window slightly and tell him she didn't want to come and then they would drive off. He found their behaviour frustrating and heart breaking.

[141] C.G.H. said that at the Sunday exchanges he sometimes remained in his vehicle and sometimes got out and went to the vehicle where B. was. On every occasion, he attempted to speak to B. about coming with him. On no occasion did S.T.M. actively encourage B. to get out of the car and go with him. S.T.M. would sit there in silence and in prior or later communication between them; she would say she would not force B. to get out of the vehicle.

[142] On several Sundays, he would try to encourage B. to come with him by suggesting things that they had done in past weeks that were fun or that there were things planned for that Sunday that were going to be fun. On many occasions B. did nothing more than roll the window down an inch to and say she was not coming. On some occasions, she was not even dressed for the day, being still in her pyjamas.

[143] There were two videos of Sunday exchanges in evidence. One from November 24, 2019, that C.G.H. recorded where B. did not come with him and he said S.T.M. did not encourage her to come. The other from the April 26, 2020 exchange where D.H. said he felt intimidated by C.G.H.'s actions and that he did tell B. "Go with your dad". The circumstances of that exchange were different from many others because C.G.H. came up to the car door and T.C. was present. D.H. said change upset B. and she shut down. C.G.H. said that the video shows he was not acting aggressively towards D.H.

[144] C.G.H. said he attended all of the Sunday exchanges on time but was denied parenting time with B. every time. In addition, there was one other exchange where he was going to be late so he sent T.C. She arrived four minutes late and B. had already left the exchange location.

[145] C.G.H. said on one of the Sunday exchanges he believed S.T.M. had a witness and that she was trying to set him up to pull B. out of the vehicle. He was always polite, respectful and calm.

[146] C.G.H. alleged that S.T.M. wrongfully withheld B. from him during his scheduled parenting time contrary to the FCC Order and Section 61 of the FLA. He produced a spreadsheet of his missed parenting time in 2019 and 2020. S.T.M. did not deny that there were several days that C.G.H. missed his parenting time, almost exclusively on Sundays, but that he got some make up parenting time. C.G.H. said he got some extra parenting time in 2020 but it had nothing to do with the missed Sundays.

[147] S.T.M. said other missed parenting time included:

- a)  The first two Tuesdays after the FCC Order when C.G.H. did not attend at the exchange location;
- b)  One Friday when [omitted for publication] was being exchanged at the same time as B. and she refused to go. After that arrangements were made to exchange [omitted for publication] beforehand to circumvent that problem;
- c)  On two occasions B. went to S.T.M.'s home on the bus while she was at work and she did not discover that until she arrived home;
- d)  On December 31, 2019, after S.T.M. told B. that she would need to speak to C.G.H., B. texted him and asked if she could babysit that evening.  S.T.M. is not involved in scheduling B.'s babysitting appointments, B. does that directly with the parents; and
- e)  From March 10 - 31, 2020, the Parties had agreed S.T.M. would take B. to Scotland.  The trip was planned months in advance but was cut short due to the Covid-19 pandemic and B. and S.T.M. were required to quarantine at home for 2 weeks.  S.T.M. offered to have C.G.H. attend their home for B.'s birthday but he did not attend.
- [148] C.G.H. said some additional examples where he lost parenting time included:
- a)  Tuesday, September 3, 2019, he told S.T.M. that his truck was stuck in the mud and he would be late. She cancelled the parenting time;

- b)  Sunday, October 6, 2019 -S.T.M. told him that B. did not want to go with him, that the FCC Order was between them, that B. had not consented to it and that it was up to her to decide;
- c)  Sunday November 3, 2019 -B. told him that she did not want to come. He told S.T.M. that B. must come with him, but S.T.M. insisted it was B.'s choice. S.T.M. later informed him that she had a witness in the parking lot watching the exchange;
- d)  Sunday, November 24, 2019 - He was told by S.T.M. that B. did not want to come;
- e)  Sunday, December 8, 2019 - He was met by D.H. at the exchange location and B. refused to go with him;
- f) Sunday, December 15, 2019 - B. rolled down her window slightly and shouted, 'I don't want to be with you today'. D.H. drove off with B. without discussion or conversation;
- g)  Sunday, December 22, 2019 -B. told him that she did not want to see him that day. In response to him saying that she had to come B. said that she did not have to come, and that it was her choice;
- h)  Tuesday, December 31, 2019 -S.T.M. advised him that B. had babysitting planned for the day and that she would not be coming for parenting time. He sought clarification if he was going to be getting B. for his parenting time and why B.'s babysitting was arranged on his parenting time. He referred S.T.M. to The Report that booking activities for B. things during the other Party's time could be seen as interference;
- i) Tuesday, February 4, 2020 - He was waiting for B. at school when he realized it was S.T.M.'s birthday so he told S.T.M. that he would make B. available to be with her for that day only. S.T.M. kept B. but no make-up parenting time was ever offered;
- j) Sunday, February 9, 2020 -He noticed D.H. smiling when B. said that it was her choice whether she wanted to go with him or not. He asked 'why?' and B. said he should 'ask mom';
- k)  Sunday, February 16, 2020 -B. refused to go with him. Before she drove off he pre-emptively asked questions and made positive statements to her about when she is with him and T.C., she has a good time, she smiles and laughs, he loved her, and that they had fun together;
- l) Sunday, February 23, 2020 -B. arrived covered in a blanket, rolled her window down slightly and refused to come. He asked B. 'who tells you that you get to choose?' at which point D.H. leaned over and

- whispered something to B. He asked D.H. what he was saying to B, but she shouted 'NO!' and they drove off;
- m) Sunday, March 1, 2020 -B. arrived covered in a blanket and refused to come. B. had a brief exchange with D.H. that appeared to empower her, she said 'bye' and they drove away;
- n)  March 10, 15, 17, 20, 24, 27, &amp; 31, 2020He agreed to allow S.T.M. to take B. to Scotland from March 9, to March 24, although he was never made aware of the trip directly by S.T.M. Their trip was cut short due to COVID-19 and they were required to quarantine at home for 14 days until March 31. He missed his entire scheduled Spring Break week with B. due to the quarantine;
- o)  Sunday, April 19, 2020 -B. said did not want to go. D.H. said B. does not want to come, and they will try again next time'. He explained that it is not B.'s choice, and he has a legal right to his parenting time to which D.H. responded with 'try again next time' and drove away;
- p)  Friday, April 24, 2020- S.T.M. suggested T.C. speak to B. privately, but B. still refused to come and they drove away. S.T.M. later informed him that she had recorded T.C.'s conversation with B. and would be forwarding the recording to her lawyer;
- q)  Sunday, April 26, 2020- D.H. arrived with B. B. said she would not come that day because she did not want to. There was a further extended exchange between him and D.H. in which he was calm, polite and not intimidating before D.H. drove off. This exchange was recorded by T.C.;
- r) Sunday, May 24, 31, June 7, 21 July 5 and 26, 2020 - B. arrived, rolled down her window down and refused to come. He said that this was their scheduled time together but B. simply repeated that she did not want to come;
- s)  Sunday, June 28, 2020 - He did not receive his parenting time the day after the Shotgun Incident. S.T.M. contended that B. was very afraid because she had found the shotgun the day before. There was no earlier mention of the shotgun from B., her friend, the friend's mother or S.T.M.;
- t) In the summer of 2020, S.T.M. asked for three Tuesday's with B. because she wanted to go see her family. In compensation, He requested an extra overnight that he never received. In August he requested a week with B. to go on a summer holiday but only received a single night; and
- u)  January 14 - January 19, 2021- He was unable to have his parenting time due to the MCFD investigation. While this was not a denial of

parenting time, he should receive make up parenting time for these days.

[149] In November 2019, Dr. Aube interviewed the Parties and others, prepared The Report and provided it to the Parties. C.G.H. endorsed Dr. Aube's findings, opinions and recommendations. S.T.M. seriously disagreed with the contents and accuracy of The Report but did agree with the recommendations concerning B.'s parenting time with each of the Parties.

## 2020

[150] In April 2020, soon after the Covid restrictions started, Dr. Ambrose suggested that an increase in C.G.H.'s parenting time with B. might be appropriate because B.'s anxieties and stress were at a reduced level and school was cancelled. The Parties agreed with that idea but it did not occur.

[151] C.G.H. and T.C. brought horses to their home. At first B. was very enthusiastic about the horses, enjoyed riding and spending time with them. C.G.H. said this was but one example of him acting on S.T.M.'s suggestion to get B. engaged in activities but they do not work out.

[152] One of T.C.'s mares was due to foal in May 2020. B. was the very excited about the prospective birth and insisted she be notified as soon as the foal was born. The day of the foal's birth B. came to C.G.H. home earlier than her scheduled arrival time. B. wanted to spend a lot of time with the foal going as far as sleeping in its stall. She was very engaged.

[153] The Unicorn Club is an equine-based therapy resource for children with special needs. It has had a lot of success working with children who have a variety of disabilities. T.C. and C.G.H. thought such a resource would benefit B. given her interest in the foal. B. went for one lesson and then within a few weeks said she was no longer

interested in that activity. When the foal was a few months old, S.T.M. said B. was no longer interested in horses.

[154] S.T.M. said that B. said that she felt forced to go riding and stopped all interest in the horses. This upset S.T.M. because she had hoped that B. would enjoy the horses at both C.G.H.'s and her home. She was unaware that B. had the opportunity to participate in the Unicorn Club.

[155] On June 1, 2020, C.G.H. filed a Notice of Motion and an Application for Urgent Hearing under the Court's Covid-19 protocol (the Motion). On the same day, he filed an affidavit attaching numerous documents that were resubmitted at trial.

## The Shotgun Incident

[156] On June 27, 2020, B. and a friend found a shotgun under C.G.H.'s bed. This occurred when C.G.H. and T.C. were away for slightly over an hour purchasing lifejackets. During that time, B. and her friend were frightened by some noises they heard. They contacted S.T.M. and she suggest that they look around the house to satisfy themselves that there was nothing there.

[157] In doing so they went into C.G.H.'s room, which S.T.M. was unaware B. was prohibited from doing, and discovered a shotgun under the bed. They took pictures of the gun and sent them to the friend's mother who contacted S.T.M. and later C.G.H. to ensure that the children were safe.

[158] S.T.M. said that the children were left alone for an extended period and that they were very frightened by what they found under the bed. C.G.H. said the shotgun was usually stored in a gun safe but was under the bed because there had been some bear sightings in the neighbourhood and his mare had recently foaled and he was concerned about a bear attacking.

[159] At some point subsequent to the Shotgun Incident, an entry was made on the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC) database concerning C.G.H. even though the RCMP never interviewed him about the matter and he was never charged. C.G.H. was very concerned that the CPIC notation would pose difficulty in him renewing his firearms license, which he requires for his fieldwork, and that in any future dealings with the police or any international travel he may be restricted because of that notation. C.G.H. said that he believed S.T.M. had something to do with the CPIC notation and that he had to spend considerable time and money to get the entry reversed.

[160] S.T.M. said she did not make the notation herself nor did she know who made that it. She had no input into it nor access to that part of the file because of the nature of the investigation.

## August 2020 Order

[161] On June 19 and July 3, 2020, the Motion was heard. On August 13, 2020, the Court released Reasons for Judgment found at S.T.M. v C.G.H . 2020 BCPC 181 and granted an interim order that included:

- a)  Specific parenting time to C.G.H. with B;
- b)  Recognizing the Parties as B.'s guardians;
- c)  Equal division of parental responsibilities except for B.'s health decisions which were granted to S.T.M.;
- d)  Specific times, dates and exchange locations for C.G.H.'s parenting time with B. with additional enabling clauses;
- e)  Communication methods with B. and between the Parties;
- f) Arranging activities for B. and ensuring she attends those activities;
- g)  Conduct orders, and
- h)  Police enforcement if parenting time was denied. (the August 2020 Order)
- [162] The Reasons for Judgment made a number of suggestions to assist the Parties in trying to move forward in their relationships with B. including:

- a)  S.T.M. reduce her electronic communication with B. during C.G.H.'s parenting time as endorsed by Dr. Ambrose and that S.T.M. should make that clear to B.; and
- b)  That C.G.H. take more time to listen to B. and understand her perspective and anxieties.
- [163] C.G.H. said he never spoke to B. about the police enforcement clause in the August 2020 Order. After the FCC Order, he did have some conversations with S.T.M. about that order in front of B. However, he has not had any discussions with or made comments to B. about lawyers, judges and the Court since the August 2020 Order.
- [164] S.T.M. said that after the August 2020 Order things went better for B. and she was prepared to go to C.G.H.'s with only a few complaints or concerns. Those concerns mostly occurred on Mondays in the early fall of 2020 after her time with C.G.H. when B. would complain of being tired, being unable to focus and having migraines.
- [165] C.G.H. asserted and S.T.M. denied that the police enforcement clause resulted in B. going to all of the exchanges because S.T.M. was afraid of the embarrassment of her [omitted for publication] colleagues having to come to enforce the order.
- [166] S.T.M. suggested, through Dr. Ambrose, that B. and C.G.H. have a session with Dr. Ambrose on those Mondays to work on any issues B. had arising from the weekend but that never occurred.
- [167] Despite that, frequent electronic communication between S.T.M. and B. continued during C.G.H.'s parenting time. S.T.M. said that she would only respond to B.'s messages when B. reached out to her. However, the documentary evidence showed S.T.M. initiating text messages with B. on various occasions.
- [168] It appears that, following the August 2020 Order, S.T.M. never communicated to B. that it was inappropriate for B. to be contacting her on every slight matter, despite correspondence from her counsel that she would address the issue.

[169] C.G.H. said that both before and after the August 2020 Order B.'s electronic contact with S.T.M. continued unabated with tens, and sometimes hundreds, of various types of electronic communication occurring between them every day when B. is with him . He said B. would often take her iPad to the bathroom and stay in there for hours communicating with S.T.M.

[170] C.G.H. said it is important to consider the electronic communication to understand how B. acts and how S.T.M. responds.  C.G.H. produced a spreadsheet of a sampling of messages between S.T.M. and B., from March 2019 to August 2021 including the following examples:

- a)  On March 29, 2019, 35 texts in less than 5 minutes. No response from S.T.M.;
- b)  On June 5, 2020, many pages of emojis texted to S.T.M.;
- c)  September 13/14, 2020 - 73 messages and 31 deleted messages and S.T.M. responded 13 times;
- d)  October 12, 2020 - 72 messages and 17 deleted messages;
- e)  November 21, 2020 - 55 messages and 25 deleted messages;
- f) December 6, 2020 - 60 messages and 6 deleted messages;
- g)  January 1, 2021 - 112 messages;
- h)  February 14, 2021 - 69 messages;
- i) July 5, 2021 - 177 messages; and
- j) August 2, 2021 - 137 messages.
- [171] S.T.M. said that if she does not respond, B. begins to spiral and will just continue to text and call until she answers.  This often happens in the middle of the night when B. cannot sleep.  S.T.M. said she worked hard with Dr. Ambrose to limit these communications in a way that is healthy for B.

[172] C.G.H. said B. insists on watching television at night in her bedroom before she falls asleep. This is not healthy and was discouraged by Dr. Ambrose. B. should be listening to music or meditative sounds to assist her in her sleep and not watching

television or spending time communicating with S.T.M. on her tablet because that reduces the effectiveness of her sleep.

[173] Dr. Aube was unaware of the amount of electronic communication between B. and S.T.M. at the time of The Report. When informed of that issue at trial she said that it was impeding C.G.H.'s parenting time, and it was like using a 'remote control' over B. If she had known that information prior to The Report, she would have recommended C.G.H. have final decision - making authority.

[174] The August 2020 Order included conduct orders about respectful communication. C.G.H. alleged that S.T.M. has either ignored or made a mockery of those orders with statements, messages and actions that are disparaging of him and do nothing to help support building his relationship with B. She negatively critiqued his decisions and household rules to B. from a distance.

[175] The August 2020 Order provided that after one Party drops B. off at school for an exchange, the other Party becomes responsible for any matters that might arise at school. C.G.H. said that S.T.M. breached that order by frequently attending B.'s school during his parenting time.

[176] S.T.M. said that B.'s behaviours became more worrisome in the early winter of 2020 when she started writing depressive poems, talked about running away from C.G.H.'s and caused damage to his home.

[177] B. kept a journal at C.G.H.'s home. In the journal, parts of which she shared with S.T.M., she expressed deep hatred and loathing for C.G.H. B. also used a rock to scratch the floor in her bedroom at C.G.H.'s home and sent a photo of that to S.T.M. S.T.M. said that she told B. that such behaviour was inappropriate. She brought those two matters to Dr. Ambrose's, but not C.G.H.'s, attention. S.T.M. said she is not prepared to tell B. that her feelings and actions are wrong even if they are inappropriate. B. shared that information with her because B. believes she can share everything with S.T.M.

[178] C.G.H. said when B. scratched her bedroom floor at his home she communicated with S.T.M. about wanting to come home and S.T.M. said she would attempt to make that happen. He was not aware of the scratched floor until much later and it was not a major issue.

[179] S.T.M. said B. has a lot of difficulty with cutlery at meal times. B. reported that she was upset when she was in Jasper with C.G.H. and he was critical of her use of cutlery. People with ASD often have difficulty with fine motor skills such as eating with cutlery. B. reported that she could not stand the noise the knife was making on the plate so she tipped it upside down. When B. got home from Jasper, she took all the cutlery in S.T.M.'s home and hid it. S.T.M. did not see that as problematic.

[180] In November 2020, S.T.M. suggested to C.G.H. a change to the August 2020 Order such that B. would be returned to her on Sunday evening rather than to school on Monday to give B. time to decompress and get a good night's sleep but he your refused. C.G.H. said that when S.T.M. contacted him about reducing his parenting time from Monday morning to Sunday evening he refused her suggestion because the Court recognized that an increase in his parenting time was appropriate and both The Report and Dr. Ambrose endorsed that view.

[181] C.G.H. said that after the August 2020 Order, which included the police enforcement clause, he did not miss any of his scheduled parenting time with B. except for during the time MCFD was dealing with a disclosure made by B. in January 2021.

[182] C.G.H. said that since the August 2020 Order when B. comes to his home she is initially confused and anxious but soon falls into the routine of the household enjoying herself and activities they engage in. T.C. said that it was around September 2020 that they started noticing improvements with B. being more affectionate with her and C.G.H. Since B.'s time increased to five days in 2021, she has been even more able to relax and fall into the routine of his household while she is there.

[183] However, on the last day before she is to return to S.T.M.'s home, B. becomes withdrawn as if she was turning off prior to her return. She also shows signs of anxiety if anyone asks about what is going on in her life at S.T.M.'s home. C.G.H. noted that despite the noticeable improvements with B. at his home, S.T.M. approached, and encouraged B. to speak with him about reducing his parenting time.

[184] On November 21, 2020, B. told S.T.M. that she wanted to return to her home sooner than scheduled time. Rather than encouraging B. to remain at C.G.H.'s home she told B. that she missed her.

[185] S.T.M. said C.G.H. regularly tells her that B. is enjoying her time with him and the activities that they participate in at his home but that is not what B. tells her. B. says she does not enjoy her time with C.G.H. She has learned from reading about people with ASD that often they camouflage by looking like they're having a good time when really they're upset and holding everything inside until later when they can release it to somebody they trust.

[186] In December 2020, B. contacted S.T.M. when she was at C.G.H.'s home and said that she was seeing devils. S.T.M. provided B. with holy water that she used to make crosses on various windows and mirrors in C.G.H.'s home. Neither B. nor S.T.M. told C.G.H. about devils in his home or B.'s wish to use holy water at the time. He found out about it afterwards.

[187] C.G.H. said that when B. has concerns that she shares with S.T.M. but not him S.T.M. takes no steps to contact him to inform him or to suggest how they might be alleviated. She does however communicate extensively with B. in a fashion that does not reinforce B's relationship with him.

## 2021

## B.'s Disclosure

[188] S.T.M. said that in early 2021, B. became constipated during the time she was with C.G.H. causing other physiological issues upon her return to S.T.M. She reported that to Dr. Ambrose who worked with B. to alleviate her anxieties of being at C.G.H.'s home.

- [189] In early January 2021, B. made a disclosure to her school social worker alleging inappropriate behaviour by C.G.H. The social worker contacted MCFD and an investigation by MCFD and the RCMP ensued. During that time, S.T.M. was instructed not to discuss the disclosure with B. and C.G.H.'s parenting time was suspended.
- [190] S.T.M. said that she spoke to social workers and agreed that an interview would not take place at the school. She said she did not receive any instructions from the MCFD social workers that they insisted on being present during an interview but SW Shalaina Weibe (Ms. Weibe), an MCFD child protection social worker assigned to the matter, contradicted that evidence. S.T.M. said she was told by someone to take B. to the North District RCMP office for an interview.
- [191] Ms. Wiebe said she confirmed with S.T.M. and RCMP members that an interview of B. would not take place without her being present to reduce the possibility of having to conduct a second interview of B. However, without the knowledge of anybody at MCFD the RCMP interviewed B. She attempted to contact C.G.H. to advise him about what was occurring but was unable to reach him until later.
- [192] Sgt. Jennifer Collins conducted the interview at the RCMP North District office to isolate the matter from S.T.M. who works at the [omitted for publication]. Sgt. Collins concluded it was not a criminal matter and that MCFD could continue their investigation. She relayed that information to S.T.M. but not to C.G.H.
- [193] During that interview B. disclosed:
- a)  C.G.H. made her drink alcohol and play beer pong;
- b)  She often gets into trouble at his residence;

- c)  She gave C.G.H. beer so he would fall asleep to get away from him; and
- d)  She feels C.G.H. is 'evil' and that he calls her a liar and crazy.

[194] After reviewing the details of the RCMP interview of B. and being advised that B. was involved in ongoing counselling with Dr. Ambrose MCFD made a decision that no further investigation was necessary.

- [195] Based on the disclosure provided by the RCMP and MCFD, S.T.M. has no concerns about B.'s safety with C.G.H. but she is concerned as to why B. would react in the way she did.

[196] S.T.M. was concerned about some of the disclosure made by B. Including that C.G.H. and his brother drink alcohol together, that B. wished C.G.H. would drink until he "passed out", and that B. was very sad about having to spend time with C.G.H. She referred that information to Dr. Ambrose.

[197] In response to B.'s disclosure C.G.H. said:

- a)  He never forced B. to play beer pong during a holiday to the Okanagan. B. was playing a game with other children they called beer pong but they were in fact drinking orange juice and water;
- b)  He does not drink excessively and pass out. He is a moderate drinker and tries not to drink very much at all when he is parenting B. He has never offered her alcohol to drink nor has she ever consumed alcohol in his presence. He is not a beer drinker and keeps no beer in the home;
- c)  B. never told him about having devils in his home and S.T.M. never told him that she supplied 'holy water' to help B. exercise those devils which caused further miscommunication and a rift between them; and
- d)  It is not true he has called her a liar and that she is crazy.

[198] S.T.M. said that in the late spring of 2021, B. told her that C.G.H. was continuing to talk about her disclosure and that he said she was a bad person and a liar. B. told S.T.M. that she was self-harming and S.T.M. brought that to Dr. Ambrose's attention.

S.T.M. said she now thinks that the disclosure may be a form of bridge burning which people with ASD sometimes do.

[199] Subsequent to the RCMP investigation, the notation on CPIC about C.G.H. was discovered. Sgt. Collins said she had no knowledge of how the notation about C.G.H. appeared on CPIC because she has no access to that database.

[200] C.G.H. said he was kept totally in the dark and received absolutely no information from any official source about the nature of the disclosure investigation or its results other than receiving information approximately a week later that the investigation had concluded with no adverse findings.

[201] He was not able to speak to B. about her complaints in order to address them in any fashion but he did discuss the matter with Dr. Ambrose who said she would speak to B. about the matter. After Dr. Ambrose spoke to B., she reported to C.G.H. that B. did not have any remorse for making the disclosure or any real understanding of how serious it was.

[202] S.T.M. said that C.G.H. disclosed The Report to MCFD, B.'s school and Dr. Ambrose without her approval, which was a serious breach of her and B.'s privacy.

[203] S.T.M. said that she tells B. to be truthful even if it is in the face of a negative response from her or C.G.H. C.G.H. said he has never accused B. of being a liar although he has explained to her on several occasions the necessity and value of telling the truth and not lying. S.T.M. permitted B. to lie to him for over two years about her stepfamily.

[204] C.G.H. said that the disclosure allegations were old complaints that B. had raised with him and S.T.M. in years past and Dr. Ambrose had addressed them. He said that after the investigation ended, he and T.C. continued to walk on eggshells and his hands were tied with regard to exercising any parental authority or control over B. He is not able to communicate freely with B.  He does not ask her why she is feeling the way she

is feeling towards him.  He does not address some of the fears and anxieties that she has around him.  He does not speak to B. about her historical complaints against him. B. does not feel comfortable enough to share these things with him either.

[205] If he attempted to do so, B. would report to S.T.M. who will then contend he was not sensitive to B.'s needs and her condition. At the suggestion of the professionals, particularly Dr. Ambrose, he has not had the opportunity to sit down with B. and discuss the false disclosure and how they might resolve things going forward.

[206] C.G.H. believes that B. is a very troubled young woman but that many of her anxieties are because of the enmeshed relationship she has with S.T.M., their codependency and S.T.M.'s alienation of B. from him. A lot of B.'s behaviours and anxieties are a result of he and S.T.M. not being able to communicate and co-parent successfully and that means they need outside assistance through FST and a parenting coordinator.

[207] On February 18, 2021, C.G.H. filed an Amended Reply of the Reply originally filed on March 13, 2019 and an Amended Notice of Motion originally filed June 1, 2020. In the Amended Reply C.G.H. seeks sole guardianship, parental responsibilities and parenting time with B. as well as child support and cancelling of any child support arrears.

[208] C.G.H. said B. often takes medications while at his home without him being aware of what she is taking. She will communicate with S.T.M. who will suggest to her what to take without keeping him informed. On one occasion in winter, S.T.M. suggested that B. reach outside her window to get some snow to ease her sore throat.

[209] C.G.H. said that S.T.M. on rare occasions relays vague details about B.'s health concerns but she will not communicate clearly with him about the details of those issues so that he can properly address them. S.T.M. said she does not tell C.G.H. about B.'s medications at his home because in the past when she tried to discuss matters with C.G.H. he just turns things around.

[210] S.T.M. said that in the summer of 2021, Dr. Ambrose told her that she did not need to schedule any further appointments for herself and B. jointly but that she would continue to have appointments with B. and C.G.H. on a regular basis. As far as she was aware, C.G.H. did not take any steps to ensure regularly scheduled appointments for B. and him with Dr. Ambrose.

[211] On one occasion, [omitted for publication] ate a chocolate cookie while B. was at C.G.H.'s home. Rather than consult with T.C., a veterinarian, about [omitted for publication]' health, B. communicated electronically with S.T.M. B. told S.T.M. that she did not want to talk to C.G.H. or T.C. because she would be in trouble for having food in her room. S.T.M. did not insist that B. talk to T.C. but did some online research and then reassured B. that [omitted for publication] would be fine.

[212] C.G.H. said B. sneaks things supplied by S.T.M. into his home such as cookies, cakes and candies to which he objects. Many gifts that he and W.C. give to B. are taken from their home to S.T.M.'s and never returned.

[213] C.G.H. said that although B. has often communicated with S.T.M. about feeling unsafe in his home she has never had a conversation with him about that subject to allow him to take any steps to make her feel more comfortable.

[214] In the summer of 2021 B., C.G.H. and T.C. went on vacation to the Toronto area. T.C. said she and C.G.H. started talking to B. about that trip in 2019 and showed her pictures of her family members and the house they would be visiting. The trip was postponed from 2020 due to Covid. S.T.M. wanted B. to bring [omitted for publication] but as a brachycephalic dog breed [omitted for publication] could suffer distress or death in the cargo hold of an airplane and she was too big to travel in the cabin.

[215] T.C. said they took many photographs of their trip showing everyone, enjoying their time with friends and family in southern Ontario. While there they went to a haunted house attraction, rode on a Ferris wheel, toured a butterfly conservatory and drove through an African safari; all of which B. found very entertaining.

[216] T.C. said that during the vacation, B. would text S.T.M. regularly and she would text her more on the days she was having the most amount of fun. She was unaware of the content of those texts until later when C.G.H. downloaded them from B.'s iPad. On the flight home, they treated everyone to first-class seating. When B. was told about that arrangement, she was very excited but in the day before and on the trip home, she became very distant and disengaged.

[217] S.T.M. said that prior to the trip to Toronto, B. said she would just run away and find a police officer when they got to Toronto so she would not have to spend time with C.G.H. B. only received seven days' notice of what would be occurring on the Toronto trip, which was not enough time to prepare her. C.G.H. was also very late in advising her that [omitted for publication] could not go on the trip. B. objected to spending seven nights with C.G.H. but did go.

## High School

[218] When B. was in Grade 7, she switched from French immersion to English classes. C.G.H. said that there was very little discussion with S.T.M. about moving B. from French immersion to English studies. He was not fully involved before S.T.M. made the decision but he supported it. S.T.M. said they discussed the transfer for several months before it occurred.

[219] The French immersion program students go to a high school closer to where C.G.H. lives while those in the English program go to a high school near S.T.M.'s home. C.G.H. said he raised with B. which high school she may wish to go to in Grade 8 and advised her that they could facilitate her going to high school with her former French immersion classmates if she wished and she could use his address to fall within the catchment area. B. related to S.T.M. that C.G.H. pressured her about the options but that was not the case. S.T.M. said that B. was very upset by the suggestion. B. now attends high school nearer to S.T.M.'s residence.

[220] When B. started high school, she received an Independent Education Program (IEP) counsellor. That counsellor arranged with S.T.M. to have an appointment early in the school year. S.T.M. asked if C.G.H. would be contacted and was assured that he would be. She went to the meeting with the counsellor to discuss B.'s IEP.

Subsequently, C.G.H. accused her of going behind his back in making the appointment.

[221] C.G.H. said that S.T.M. denied making an appointment with the counsellor when she had and he only found out about later from the counsellor. The counsellor told C.G.H. that B. is transitioning well into high school.

[222] B.'s transition to high school had gone relatively smoothly in part because she was taken to the school several times in the previous school year to get familiar with it. B. had some initial struggle with her math educational assistant but they changed her to a new math class and she seems to be doing well.

[223] B. still had difficulty with gym classes because she was bullied. She left the class on several occasions. The IEP counsellor suggested an individual gym program for her that S.T.M. supported but C.G.H. initially did not so B. remained in gym class for a time. She now has an online fitness program that she is supposed to do regularly. C.G.H. said that B. does not always participate in the program when she is at his home.

[224] When B. started to have her first menstrual cycle, S.T.M. had some email communication with C.G.H. about that topic. That communication became convoluted and acrimonious.

[225] On December 21, 2021, S.T.M.'s counsel filed written submissions. On February 1, 2022, C.G.H.'s counsel filed written submissions. On February 11, 2022, S.T.M.'s counsel filed reply submissions.

## POST TRIAL EVENTS

[226] On March 22, 2022, B. filed an Information Form for Appointment of Lawyer for Child attaching a draft order.

[227] On March 23, 2022, T.C. filed an affidavit sworn on February 15, 2022, detailing concerns she had about B.'s best interests arising from information she received from third parties about the status of S.T.M.'s and D.H.'s relationship. The information alleged that S.T.M. was having an affair with J.L.

[228] On March 23, 2022, S.T.M., J.L., C.S., and N.S. filed affidavits in response to the affidavit filed by T.C. refuting her allegations.

[229] Based on the affidavits filed by S.T.M., C.G.H.'s counsel asked the Court not consider the affidavit evidence because although T.C. stood by the information she relayed to the Court, that evidence was hearsay, and in the face of direct evidence from others, it might be innocently inaccurate. S.T.M.'s counsel maintained that the Court should consider all the affidavits because T.C. and C.G.H. were raising scandalous and false allegations about S.T.M. to gain an advantage in the litigation.

[230] On April 27, 2022, most of the persons who filed affidavits and D.H. were crossexamined. T.C. maintained that she only reported what she had heard from third parties about S.T.M.'s relationship with J.L. because she was concerned about the stability in S.T.M.'s home and how that might impact B. She acknowledged contacting the family of S.T.M.'s former deceased spouse to obtain information about any violence in their relationship.

[231] C.S., J.L. and S.T.M. contradicted T.C.'s evidence about the nature of S.T.M. and J.L.'s relationship. S.T.M. accused C.G.H. and T.C. of trying to dig up dirt about her past relationship. D.H. was unaware of most of the history and dynamics of S.T.M. and J.L.'s relationship.

[232] In the summer of 2022, S.T.M. and D.H. separated. He and his two sons moved from S.T.M.'s residence. Commencing on August 10, 2022, D.H. began contacting

C.G.H. alleging that S.T.M. was in a romantic relationship with J.L. that had been the subject of the April 2022 court proceedings.

[233] On August 25, 2022, C.G.H. filed an affidavit attaching an extensive text message exchange he had with D.H. in which D.H. provided details of his allegations concerning S.T.M.'s relationship with J.L. That affidavit was brought to the Court's attention during the August 25, 2023 hearing to determine if B. would have a lawyer appointed to represent her.

[234] On November 16, 2022, C.G.H. filed a further affidavit updating the communication between himself and D.H. up to October 14, 2022. That affidavit also raised the concern that B. had not been participating in any counselling sessions with Dr. Ambrose since March 2022 and he was unsure if sessions had resumed.

[235] On December 14, 2022, S.T.M. filed an affidavit refuting D.H.'s allegations that she was in a romantic relationship with J.L. and that those false allegations were raised months before by C.G.H. and T.C. put additional strain on her relationship with D.H. to the point that they separated.

[236] S.T.M.'s affidavit also addressed Dr. Ambrose's ongoing counselling relationship with B. Dr. Ambrose stopped seeing patients in March 2022 and she did not return to work until the fall. During that time, B. was without a counsellor. S.T.M. said she looked for another counsellor but was unsuccessful. C.G.H. was critical of her attempts but did not take any similar steps.

[237] In November 2022, S.T.M. contacted Dr. Ambrose and the sessions resumed. Dr. Ambrose is working on a restricted basis but S.T.M. was confident that further sessions could be arranged depending on B.'s requests and Dr. Ambrose's advice.

[238] On December 14, 2022, D.H. filed an affidavit in which he confirmed that he had no evidence of any romantic relationship between S.T.M. and J.L. despite what he had told C.G.H. in telephone conversations and numerous text messages.

[239] On January 20, 2023, C.G.H., S.T.M. and D.H. were cross-examined. C.G.H. was not cross-examined about S.T.M.'s romantic relationship with J.L. or Dr. Ambrose's counselling schedule with B.

## [240] S.T.M.'s cross-examination evidence included:

- a)  The information C.S. had about the nature of her relationship with Mr. J.L. was both inaccurate and dated;
- b)  She has spent overnights at J.L.'s residence to assist with parenting challenges regarding one of his children;
- c)  Although she believes an equal parenting time with C.G.H. would be good at some point in the future she believes that a parenting schedule from Thursday to Sunday evening an alternate weeks would be in B.'s best interests at this time. Although she does not agree with B.'s view on how much parenting time C.G.H. should receive B.'s views cannot be fully discounted; and
- d)  Her separation from D.H. was in part the result of the soap opera drama and false allegations raised by C.G.H. and T.C. Although she and D.H. are separated, B. still sees his sons on a regular basis.

## [241] D.H.'s cross-examination evidence included:

- a)  He was aware of S.T.M.'s friendship with J.L. and that she spent some overnights at his residence helping with his children or babysitting;
- b)  He communicated with C.G.H. both by phone and by text. In those communications, he made many serious allegations about S.T.M. having an affair with J.L. but they were without any evidentiary foundation. When he made those allegations he was highly intoxicated and he apologizes for making them; and
- c)  He contacted S.T.M.'s counsel without any input from her and signed an affidavit acknowledging that he had given C.G.H. false information about S.T.M. and J.L. After filing that affidavit, he recommenced communication with C.G.H. where he again made unsubstantiated allegations about S.T.M. and J.L. for which he also apologizes.

## EXPERTS

Dr. Ambrose

[242] Dr. Ambrose is a Registered Psychologist specializing in child clinical psychology. Since 2013, she has provided individual therapy for youth with a variety of mental health conditions. She is qualified to complete ASD assessments through the BC Autism Assessment Network.

[243] Dr. Ambrose was qualified as an expert in providing therapy to youth with mental health conditions including anxiety and OCD and the assessment and diagnosis of ASD.

[244] She was retained to treat and assist B. They began working together in January 2018, initially weekly then, over time, to less frequent sessions. That also involved meeting and working with S.T.M. and C.G.H. Soon after she began working with B., she diagnosed her with SAD and GAD.

[245] Those disorders manifested in B's:

- a)  Struggles to separate from S.T.M. in many locations and circumstances;
- b)  A large spectrum of worries and fears either rational or extreme depending on the actual risk including public washrooms, being close to homeless people, attending doctors' offices in the hospital, and touching meat;
- c)  Her reluctance to go to C.G.H.'s home; and
- d)  Physical symptoms including vomiting and diarrhoea.

[246] Some of the treatments she has utilized with B. included Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), exposure therapy that was gradual and consistent and involved the assistance of the Parties, and prescription medication.

[247] In November 2018, Dr. Ambrose suggested a further diagnosis for B. of OCD and recommended medication to assist her. Both Parties initially expressed some reluctance with that course of treatment. However, after further research S.T.M. accepted that medication and continued assistance from Dr. Ambrose would benefit B.

[248] C.G.H. continued to oppose the medication approach until February 2019. He said that based on his medical knowledge as a paramedic, he was concerned that once a person started on the medication recommended by Dr. Ambrose they would remain on it for the rest of their life.

[249] There was controversy between the Parties surrounding prescribing medication for B. S.T.M. said that there was an agreement that both Parties would meet with the doctor to discuss the matter but an earlier appointment became available. She was unable to contact C.G.H. to let him know but she kept that appointment and the doctor prescribed the medication.

[250] C.G.H. said the Parties had agreed that they would both speak to the doctor before medication was prescribed, but S.T.M. went ahead with an appointment without him and obtained the prescription. He said S.T.M. was making important decisions about B. behind his back, which further deteriorated their communication. He maintained that B. has never been diagnosed with OCD. Once B. started her medication, it had a positive effect almost immediately.

[251] C.G.H. said he has concerns that B.'s prescription medication for OCD and anxiety seemed to give her frequent headaches for which she takes further medications. He believes the medications may have contributed to B.'s unhealthy weight gain and health effects takes her doing poorly at school.

[252] S.T.M. said that in the past C.G.H. did not ensure that B. took her medication as prescribed. C.G.H. said that there is only one occasion when B. did not take her medication when with him on an overnight trip and that was because she had forgotten to bring the dose from S.T.M.'s home. He checked the Internet and satisfied himself that missing one dose was not dangerous.

[253] C.G.H. said that at some point Dr. Ambrose suggested that his parenting time with B. should gradually increase up to seven days. S.T.M. told him that once B. had the

necessary tools to address her OCD an increase in his parenting time would be appropriate.

[254] C.G.H. said that Dr. Ambrose has been of great assistance to B. and a great resource for him as well. They have had many joint sessions in which Dr. Ambrose has gently corrected many of B.'s misconceptions or concerns about him.

[255] Dr. Ambrose did not prepare a report but some of her observations of B. and the Parties are summarized in The Report and include:

- a)  B. has constant fears that C.G.H. will be mad at her or S.T.M. She also fears that S.T.M. will be mad at her;
- b)  B. has difficulty in communicating with C.G.H. particularly regarding her feelings. Her lack of assertion makes her look much less mature. Her maturity fluctuates from age-appropriate to much younger;
- c)  B. acknowledges that she has a good time at C.G.H.'s house. She would like to go on vacations with him but only for short durations. When B. is anxious she distances herself from C.G.H.;
- d)  C.G.H. and S.T.M.'s negative perceptions of each other impact B. who is very in tune with and able to pick up on their mutual tension. The Parties need to find a way to get along if they want B. to be a healthy child;
- e)  After having it explained to her, S.T.M. understood B.'s OCD compulsion loop and tried to encourage distancing from B. and more independence but B. has a hard time letting go;
- f) B. does not feel comfortable when C.G.H. questions her about what goes on in S.T.M.'s home and for that reason she did not tell C.G.H. about her step family for a long time;
- g)  B. has difficulty describing positive things that occur in C.G.H.'s home without considerable discussion, reframing and encouragement. She does spontaneously describe positive time spent with T.C.; and
- h)  Since B. has been on OCD medication her confidence and assertiveness has improved and she has come out of her shell.

[256] Dr. Ambrose's trial evidence about B.'s anxieties included:

- a)  In guiding parents on how to deal with a child with anxiety, they should be in the middle of the continuum. They should not be at one end where they are constantly saving the child and putting the child in virtually a bubble nor at the other end of being stern and seemingly uncaring about the child's fears;
- b)  B.'s anxieties and OCD have been wrapped up in a compulsion loop where her compulsive fears are reinforced by a parent who is actually trying to help them because the parent is not approaching the situation appropriately; and
- c)  Through exposure therapy, many of B.'s anxieties and fears such as touching raw meat, public washrooms and being near homeless people were overcome but were replaced with some new ones including general sadness, freezing up in gym class and believing she was being videoed or monitored in a variety of circumstances.

## [257] Dr. Ambrose's trial evidence on B.'s ASD included:

- a)  ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is not curable. The brain is wired in a certain way and it will always be that way. Therapy is utilized to assist in having the patient understand that and find workarounds;
- b)  B.'s ASD is at a very high-level (formerly called Asperger's) and does not really interfere with her day-to-day life in many areas. She has some sensory processing issues that makes her particularly sensitive to things like loud noises and the tactile sensation of her clothing and food. She has worked with B. on some of her atypical behaviours including not eating with her hands and wearing inappropriate clothing;
- c)  Some people utilize camouflage in which they observe the behaviours of others and then try to make their behaviour respond to that if they see that the behaviour elicits a certain response;
- d)  It would be beneficial if others accommodated people with ASD so they do not have to try constantly to overcome their struggles. But people with ASD benefit from learning to overcome some of their struggles so they can improve their functioning and fit in with society;
- e)  Some people with ASD also exhibit selective mutism in certain social settings. She has not observed this in B. But there are times where B. will be quiet when she feels anxious or uncomfortable;
- f) Change is often very difficult for people with ASD. Transitions are difficult for B. but if they are repeated in a consistent fashion, it will be easier on her. Making changes more predictable and with advance knowledge, also described as preloading, is of benefit to B.;

- g)  B. has symptoms of rigid thinking where she is unable to accept and understand a different perspective from what she has formulated based on her view of a certain set of circumstances. This type of thinking is hard to overcome regardless of what alternate information is presented;
- h)  B. has difficulties understanding the cues of other people's feelings and thoughts that makes her awkward in social situations such as thinking someone is angry with her when that is not the case;
- i) Many of B.'s complaints to her about C.G.H. or being at his home were, when explored, relatively trivial and often occur in both homes. These include the fear of touching meat or having to do chores. When B. complains about C.G.H.'s actions her reactions to them are much larger than what actually occurred;
- j) It took a lot of work to get B. to be able to sit down and discuss her fears or concerns with C.G.H. but they have made some progress in that area;
- k)  B. has told her several times that she feels unsafe in C.G.H.'s home. But when she asks B. to explain what makes her feel unsafe, so that they can be addressed by C.G.H., B. has no specific examples;
- l) She does not know why B. did not tell C.G.H. about her stepfamily and things that were going on in S.T.M.'s home because B. had told her about that early on in their sessions. She was surprised when C.G.H. was unaware of the circumstance when she told him;
- m) She has not tracked any changes in B.'s anxieties in relation to the amount of time she spends with C.G.H. She did notice that B.'s anxieties seem to rise at the same time the Parties were active in the litigation;
- n)  Both Parties have expressed to her that they would like an equal parenting arrangement for B. Soon after Covid broke out in April 2020, she suggested to the Parties that they move to an equal parenting regime because B.'s stress levels were low and there was an opportunity to do so because school was cancelled;
- o)  C.G.H. has cooperated with her in B.'s therapy but he did have some questions about the diagnosis of anxiety, OCD and, subsequently ASD. C.G.H. told her that he does not believe that B. has ASD and he expressed doubts that she has OCD; and
- p)  S.T.M. researched a number of experts in the area of ASD counselling who could work with B. and C.G.H. and her. She is not prepared to take on that task because she wants to focus on B. and her needs.

[258] C.G.H. noted B.'s ASD is in the mild end of the spectrum. She is attending peer counselling in Prince George and Dr. Ambrose is qualified and knowledgeable in the treatment of people with ASD. In his view, there is no need to include further ASD experts.

[259] In his experience B. does not need a lot of preloading when opportunities arise that may change her schedule such as a trip to Kamloops to visit relatives. He agrees that B. does better with consistency and routine.

[260] S.T.M. said the following about B.'s involvement with Dr. Ambrose:

- a)  When B. starts to focus negative things, she learned from Dr. Ambrose that it is a good approach to change the subject rather than directly responding. She and Dr. Ambrose implemented a plan that B. can only talk about positive things with C.G.H. for the hour before she goes to bed. If B. cannot think of anything positive, she will describe positive things that B. has done with C.G.H. No negative experiences are permitted raised at that time;
- b)  B. reported to her that C.G.H. got angry and sent her to her room without dinner because she was tapping her foot. This is a form of strimming related to OCD and ASD where the person cannot stop the behaviour;
- c)  On the occasions when B. says that she is afraid that C.G.H. will 'kill her,' she does not take that to be a literal statement. She, and Dr. Ambrose had been working to find the right approach to that situation while recognizing B.'s feelings; and
- d)  With the assistance of Dr. Ambrose, she has completely redecorated their home to assist B. in many ways including giving her own space to decompress, spending time in her bedroom and decorating it, as B. prefers.

## Dr. Aube

[261] Dr. Aube is a Registered Psychologist privately retained by the Parties in September 2019 to prepare The Report. S.T.M. chose her from a list provided by C.G.H.

[262] S.T.M. said that she believed that a View of the Child report would be sufficient and that a full Section 211 report was unnecessary but C.G.H. requested it. C.G.H. asked her to contribute $3000 to the cost and she agreed to that in correspondence between counsel. She was aware that the preparation of a full Section 211 report might be more than $6000.

[263] C.G.H. said that throughout 2019, S.T.M. repeatedly requested a Section 211 report. He eventually agreed but S.T.M. refused to pay half the cost of The Report so he paid $15,000.

[264] In early November 2019, Dr. Aube came to Prince George and interviewed the Parties at length, performed psychometric assessments on each of them and observed their interactions with B. and other family members. She also interviewed B. on two occasions. Later in November, she had some brief telephone contact with each of the Parties. In addition, Dr. Aube interviewed nine collateral witnesses including Dr. Ambrose, and reviewed numerous documents supplied by the Parties.

[265] C.G.H. acknowledged that prior to retaining Dr. Aube there was an agreement between his and S.T.M.'s counsel that they would present mutually agreed upon documents to Dr. Aube. He acknowledged that his counsel forwarded additional documents to Dr. Aube, including draft affidavit material he prepared, without the agreement of S.T.M. or her counsel. C.G.H. believed that all the information Dr. Aube relied on in The Report concerning his and S.T.M.'s history was accurate and correct.

[266] The Report, released in November 2019, addressed the issues of parenting responsibilities and parenting time, focused on the views and needs of B., in light of her age, and the ability and willingness of each of the Parties to endorse B.'s needs in exercising their parenting responsibilities. Dr. Aube said it was prepared to assist the Court in determining B.'s best interests in the face of the Parties' disputes.

[267] In The Report Dr. Aube noted the following regarding her approach to preparing The Report and her interactions with the Parties:

- a)  She received documents from both counsel and after some further correspondence from S.T.M.'s counsel believed she could examine all documents provided to her;
- b)  S.T.M. contended that C.G.H. took advantage of her financially throughout their relationship and after the separation C.G.H. coerced her into having sex with him on several occasions;
- c)  C.G.H. denied ever forcing S.T.M. to have sex noting that as a trained police officer and a martial arts expert she could easily repel him;
- d)  S.T.M. did not report a history of anxiety but did become anxious when B.'s anxiety peaked. S.T.M. seemed anxious during the interviews;
- e)  S.T.M.'s psychometric assessment profile suggested some defensiveness consistent with motivation to deny problems in order to appear better off psychologically and to avoid presenting shortcomings. It also indicated that she may not be open to or motivated to participating in treatment;
- f) C.G.H. said initially his relationship with S.T.M. was very close but after B. was born, S.T.M. distanced herself from him in favour of B. That included breastfeeding for an excessive number of months and cosleeping with B.;
- g)  C.G.H. acknowledged that he consumed wine with T.C. at dinner three or four times a week but does not have a problem with alcohol;
- h)  C.G.H.'s psychometric assessment profile was indicative in some way of a defensive profile characterized as avoidant to present shortcomings. He also indicated as someone who does not show interest in, and has substantially lower motivation for treatment than typical individuals; and
- i) Neither S.T.M.'s nor C.G.H.'s psychometric assessment results reached any threshold of psychopathology.

[268] The Report summarized each of the Parties views about B.'s history and her parenting time with them and the other Party. Much of that information was similar to the Parties' affidavit and oral evidence. However, there were some differences between what The Report attributed to each of the Parties and their evidence.

[269] The Report summarized the following clinical impressions:

- a)  S.T.M. is a resourceful person and a bright and hard worker who thrives when she feels needed and feels safe mainly when she is in control;
- b)  Although there was not enough information to determine whether S.T.M. meets the criteria for GAD generally speaking she is a mildly to moderately anxious person;
- c)  S.T.M. is a very devoted mother and advocate for B., her number one priority. However, she has an overprotective and co-dependent relationship with B.;
- d)  S.T.M. has not shielded B. from her own anxiety when they are separated and that has exacerbated B.'s anxiety symptoms;
- e)  C.G.H. is a bright person and hard worker who is hopeful that his parenting role with B. would be recognized and endorsed. He is a caring and gentle person who is avoidant of and ill-equipped to address conflict;
- f) If C.G.H. had advocated earlier for more parental involvement with B. an assessment would have been crucially beneficial when she was younger; potentially diverting the many years of habits and practice that were the seeds for her present behaviours;
- g)  B. is a charming and effervescent child who is also sensitive and very apprehensive. She is a people pleaser with great fear of disappointing either Party;
- h)  B. meets the criteria for OCD and presented with symptoms of GAD;
- i) B. is very cognizant of the Parties' tension and feelings towards each other but especially how S.T.M. feels when B. is away from her. S.T.M. is B.'s main source of security which explains their strong alignment;
- j) B.'s ambivalence towards C.G.H. is a result of several factors including,
- I. Fear of displeasing S.T.M.,
- II. Very close bonding and identification with S.T.M.,
- III. C.G.H.'s limited time with B. over the years due to him being less present earlier which might account for some mild estrangement,
- IV. S.T.M.'s difficulty in separating from B. particularly sharing her with C.G.H.;
- k)  B. also meets the criteria in DSM-5 for 'Child Affected by Parental Relationship Distress' (CAPRD) based on the concept that the child may develop behavioural, cognitive, affective, and physical symptoms

when they experience varying degrees of parental relationship distress.

[270] The Report also discussed parental alienation noting that it is a rather new concept that does not have a consistent professional definition. Psychological manipulation of a child can prevent, disturb, injure or destroy the natural bond between a child and a parent.

[271] It set out and discussed four main factors relevant to ascertaining whether alienation is the primary cause of a child's rejection of one parent and alignment with the other. They include evidence of:

- a)  The disfavoured parent had an adequate relationship with the child prior to the current contact refusal/breach in relationship;
- b)  Absence of abuse or neglect on the part of the disfavoured parent;
- c)  The favoured parent engaged in behaviours consistent with alienation including,
- I. Limiting contact,
- II. Polarization and/or allowing/forcing the child to choose,
- III. Withholding medical, social and academic information from the disfavoured parent,
- IV. Confiding in the child,
- V. Asking the child to keep secrets from the other parent,
- VI. Interference with parenting time;
- d)  The child exhibited behaviours consistent with alienation including;
- I. Campaign of denigration,
- II. Weak, frivolous and absurd reasons for the denigration,
- III. Lack of ambivalence towards the favoured parent , and
- IV. Independent thinker phenomenon.

[272] In applying those factors to the information received and reviewed The Report concluded that there were signs of parental alienation and that even though they may

have been initially unintentional and at times subtle there was evidence that B. was harmed.

[273] The Report discussed the concept of enmeshment noting that it can result in a triangulation dynamic that involves an inter-parental dispute and the forming of an alliance with one parent against the other by the child. This may result in difficulty transitioning between each parent's home and exhibiting healthy bonding with both parents. Enmeshment is often present with parental alienation as was the case with S.T.M. and B.

[274] In discussing the topic of the child's view The Report noted that B. wanted to please both of the Parties but found the decision process extremely demanding describing it as a 10 on the scale of 1 to 10 with 10 as the worst scenario.

[275] The Report discussed B.'s needs as follows:

- a)  To witness both Parties having a cordial, kind and tension free relationship;
- b)  B. being informed that she no longer makes the decision with regard to when she will spend parenting time with C.G.H. because leaving her to do so increases her anxiety;
- c)  She needs a comprehensive educational assessment;
- d)  She should continue to take her OCD medication because it is clearly helpful;
- e)  She should continue her psychotherapy with Dr. Ambrose with both Parties participating in her therapy;
- f) She needs to know that S.T.M. is excited for her in any anticipated parenting time with C.G.H. and that S.T.M. endorses her having a loving and enjoyable relationship with him;
- g)  She needs to see C.G.H. as more involved in the therapeutic process with Dr. Ambrose;
- h)  She needs to see C.G.H. more involved with her school activities, day trips and special projects;
- i) She needs to be encouraged to set an activity schedule with C.G.H. ahead of his parenting time. Although spontaneous activity with

- children is good with her anxiety disorder it is better for B. to plan one or two activities ahead; and
- j) She needs to be encouraged to express her discontent with C.G.H. directly to him and to voice her own concerns.

[276] Despite Dr. Aube saying she had expertise and experience in dealing with ASD, The Report made no mention of it and did not recommend an assessment for B.

[277] The Report's conclusions and recommendations included:

- a)  B. Is cognizant of the Parties dissension/animosity and is very fearful of upsetting either of them. Her attachment to C.G.H. needs to be fortified because it is ambivalent at present;
- b)  Both Parties have the basic abilities to parent and provide the appropriate level of care to B. and are capable of providing great nurturing;
- c)  C.G.H. has the unmistakable hallmark of a caring, loving father and B. should not be deprived of a regular and fulfilling relationship with him. S.T.M. is a caring parent but requires some substantial changes in aspects of her parenting approach;
- d)  The Court should order that the Parties equally share guardianship of B.;
- e)  The Court should order that the Parties equally share parental responsibilities but if the present level of discord continues the Court should consider giving C.G.H. all of the parental responsibilities;
- f) The Court should order that the Parties equally share parenting time with a phased in and transitional approach with specific accommodation for various important holidays and celebratory events; and
- g)  The Court should order that the Parties use the services of a parenting coordinator.

[278] In conclusion, The Report set out two possible scenarios going forward:

## Scenario A

This scenario is definitely optimistic, if S.T.M. and C.G.H. work together as a team; while assisting B. they demonstrate a kind and respectful relationship between them and that B. is permitted to love, equally, both

parents. This scenario also implies that S.T.M. will promote C.G.H.'s parenting role and encourage B. to spend time with her dad. In this scenario which implies a major change of attitude, B. will be the winner. I am totally convinced that within these parameters, B.'s anxiety and OCD features will drastically decrease and eventually vanish.

## Scenario B

This scenario is guarded with more sombre chapters;

if B. continues to make the final decisions about going to see her dad or not;

if B. does not see her parents speaking on amicable terms;

if B. continues to worry about her mother when she goes to see her father;

if B. continues to perceive some ambivalence from her mother, when she is going to be parented by her father;

if B. is not encouraged to have a healthy distance from her mother.

I am of the opinion that under these premises, B.'s emotional stability will not be improved and will perhaps regress. She will continue to be caught within this loyalty battle.

## [279] S.T.M. had many concerns about The Report including:

- a)  Dr. Aube advised that she had received additional undisclosed, information from C.G.H.'s counsel that turned out to be in accurate or false. It was her understanding that only mutually agreed upon information would be provided. She believed that Dr. Aube would be instructed not to rely on the undisclosed information from C.G.H. but that did not prove to be correct;
- b)  During the interview, Dr. Aube heavily relied on the undisclosed information that she had highlighted and underlined. Dr. Aube said that she could rely on any information she received. Dr. Aube interrogated her without allowing her to tell her side of the story and when she tried to provide correct information to refute the undisclosed information Dr. Aube brushed her off;
- c)  Soon after meeting S.T.M., Dr. Aube told her that a Section 211 report would be difficult to prepare given B.'s age and what she described as 'the history of care';
- d)  Dr. Aube expressed a particular interest in speaking to S.T.M.'s personal counsellors even though they had no dealings with either B. or C.G.H. Those counsellors assisted her with the trauma she sees in her job. She initially agreed to that but the counsellors insisted that Dr.

Aube put questions in writing and she refused. Dr. Aube did not pursue talking to their marriage counsellor because C.G.H. would not provide his consent;

- e)  Dr. Aube accused her of audio taping their conversation when she had only raised the topic with her;
- f) Dr. Aube refused to accept information from her, such as texts and emails, which refuted some of C.G.H.'s allegations about lack of communication but contended that no communication had occurred;
- g)  Dr. Aube said that she was booking B. into activities during C.G.H.'s parenting time without his consent. That only occurred when a swimming program for B. was rescheduled by the service provider to some of C.G.H.'s parenting time;
- h)  Many of B.'s mannerisms and behaviours that Dr, Aube attributed to alienation are symptoms consistent with high functioning ASD which Dr. Aube neither recognized or took into account;
- i) Although both she and C.G.H. co-slept with B. for several years Dr, Aube was only critical of her doing it;
- j) Dr. Aube, based on C.G.H.'s contention, incorrectly concluded that she had anxiety issues that affected her parenting of B. and manifested in many of B.'s behaviours;
- k)  She told Dr. Aube that the relationship between B. and C.G.H. was not good but Dr. Aube added some additional wording that it was 'not good at all" which was not what she said;
- l) The Report inaccurately stated that B. does not suffer from insomnia or nightmares when she does. At that time, B. was suffering from migraines on almost a daily basis. She did not have any weight issues. Her weight gain began after The Report was delivered;
- m) She did not tell Dr. Aube that B. should be the final decision maker or that C.G.H.'s parenting time should only be on alternate weekends. She did tell Dr. Aube that B. has to be included in the process and accept what is happening. She did not tell Dr. Aube that B. could choose to spend time at her home or C.G.H.'s home;
- n)  Dr. Aube stated that she had discussed court with B. which was true in so far as she discussed her role as a forensics expert and the need for her to testify in court but not with regard to the litigation with C.G.H.;
- o)  She disagrees with The Report's assertion that she told B. that it would kill her to be away from B.; and
- p)  She is supportive of most of Dr. Aube's recommendations about moving forward and communicated with C.G.H. about moving toward

eventual implementation of the recommendations but received no reply from him.

[280] S.T.M. said that in her meetings with Dr. Aube they discussed the issue of a psychoeducational assessment for B. She had requested that for some time but C.G.H. was resistant. After he spoke to Dr. Aube, he became more open to the idea. That resulted in the Parties retaining Dr. Rocha.

[281] She told Dr. Aube that at Christmas of 2015 and 2016, C.G.H. insisted that she buy all the presents for B. from Santa or else he was going to tell B. Santa was not real and C.G.H. said that it was her responsibility to buy the presents because she had ruined the family. C.G.H. denied that allegation.

[282] S.T.M. said she is willing to have her parenting style questioned by any experts and she is always trying to improve by relying on the advice she gets from experts such as Dr. Ambrose. She told Dr. Aube that C.G.H. does not support B.'s academic pursuits, he was opposed to B. receiving OCD therapy including medication and that he questioned the diagnosis.

[283] S.T.M. agreed that C.G.H. was not physically violent and that she concurs with the MMPI test results for C.G.H. that he is generally stable and responsible.

[284] S.T.M. agreed with Dr. Aube that B.'s social development is somewhat delayed but according to Dr. Rocha's and Dr. Welder's later assessments her cognition and maturity is age-appropriate.

[285] She took Dr. Aube's criticisms of her to heart and has reflected on them to see if there were areas in which she could improve as a parent. She consulted with Dr. Ambrose to see how her approach to dealing with B. might be increasing B.'s anxieties and how that might change to assist B.

[286] C.G.H. said that soon after S.T.M.'s interview she expressed displeasure with Dr. Aube stating that she was 'not that highly regarded'. He agreed with The Report's

content and recommendations. He said he would take whatever steps needed to implement the recommendations. Based in part on his own observations and The Report, he is very concerned that S.T.M.'s actions are indicative of parental alienation and that those actions are having a detrimental effect on his relationship with B. and B.'s overall mental health.

[287] C.G.H. said The Report suggested he have lunch with B. once a week at school. He tried that one time and B. refused to come out so he did not try again.

[288] He acknowledged that his counsel sent The Report to MCFD and others without his knowledge and S.T.M. and her counsel were not informed.

[289] D.H. was present during the observation session at S.T.M.'s home and spoke to Dr. Aube in person and by phone. His evidence of those interactions included:

- a)  Dr. Aube came to their home for breakfast. While S.T.M. was preparing breakfast Dr. Aube observed B. doing her homework and then B. took her on a tour of the house;
- b)  After that, Dr. Aube interviewed B. for approximately an hour and then he was instructed by Dr. Aube to sit next to her while she observed B. and S.T.M. interacting. He then took B. to school;
- c)  A short time later Dr. Aube phoned him. That discussion was extremely short. Dr. Aube was not interested in anything he had to say about B. but asked him questions about his relationship with S.T.M. When asked what problems he had with S.T.M. he told Dr. Aube that they were a team and that S.T.M. was very close to his sons as he was close to B.. Given the nature of Dr. Aube's questioning of him he did not trust her; and
- d)  He and S.T.M. have an open honest relationship. As far as he knows, S.T.M. has never lied to him about anything.

[290] T.C. was present during the observation session at C.G.H.'s home and spoke to Dr. Aube by phone. Her evidence of those interactions included:

- a)  Dr. Aube came to their home on two occasions for approximately three hours each. On the first occasion, Dr. Aube asked C.G.H. if he had raped S.T.M. She found that to be a shocking question; and

- b)  On the second occasion, Dr. Aube interviewed B. privately and when B. came out of that meeting, she was extremely distraught and she cried inconsolably for a long time.

[291] S.T.M.'s sister, V.B. briefly spoke to Dr. Aube by telephone. Her evidence of that interaction included:

- a)  Their conversation was difficult because she felt she was not being heard. Dr. Aube seemed surprised and confused when told that she was S.T.M.'s sister;
- b)  Before speaking to Dr. Aube she had heard that there was an allegation that her and S.T.M.'s mother was an absentee parent and she wanted to correct that error;
- c)  She described S.T.M. as very generous and that she was impressed with her ability to work full-time but was still able to take care of B. and her many medical appointments and educational activities. She also said that S.T.M. encouraged B.'s relationship with C.G.H.;
- d)  She told Dr. Aube that B. had expressed to her that she was afraid that the doctor was coming and she would be taken away from S.T.M. She explained to B. that the person was a professional and only wanted to know what is best for B. She promised B. that this was going to be a way for people to find out what was best for her;
- e)  She understood that she was to speak about what she thought of S.T.M. as a parent and she did not comment on what she thought of C.G.H. as a parent because she has not seen him and B. together for many years. At no time did she tell Dr. Aube that S.T.M. was the only accommodating parent;
- f) She did not read the entirety of The Report; only the portion concerning her interview; and
- g)  She agrees with Dr. Aube's opinion that C.G.H. is a very calm person and that it is reasonable for him to want to have a relationship and equal parenting time with B.

[292] S.T.M.'s friend, J.B. spoke briefly to Dr. Aube by phone. He could not fully recall all of the conversation but Dr. Aube's initial tone was very ignorant, arrogant and one sided but when he confronted her she did ask about some of S.T.M.'s good qualities.

[293] S.T.M.'s friend, S.T. spoke to Dr. Aube by phone. She did not recall many of the details but was aware that Dr. Aube was conducting an assessment and the questions centred on S.T.M.'s parenting.

[294] R.M. spoke briefly to Dr. Aube in person at S.T.M.'s home. He said The Report contained false and scandalous assertions about their family including how he and his wife raised S.T.M.

## The College Complaint

[295] After reading portions of The Report, R.M. and his wife filed a complaint against Dr. Aube with the College in January 2020. S.T.M. filed a similar complaint about Dr. Aube and The Report. The College consolidated the two complaints into one for the purpose of their investigation. The College released its decision on March 8, 2022.

[296] The College categorized the nature of the M.'s allegations into five main areas:

- a)  Dr. Aube was biased against S.T.M. in favour of C.G.H.;
- b)  Dr. Aube did not adequately investigate and consider critical information;
- c)  The Report contained errors and misleading statements about S.T.M. because Dr. Aube relied on false information provided by C.G.H. and did not attempt to correct or verify that information. Further, Dr. Aube used ambiguous and demeaning language in referring to S.T.M.;
- d)  Dr. Aube's behaviour was unprofessional, unethical and aggressive; and
- e)  Dr. Aube accepted, reviewed and relied on documents containing many false accusations provided by C.G.H. in breach of the agreement between the Parties that they would provide only jointly approved material. She did not provide S.T.M. the opportunity to respond and refute the allegations against her.

[297] The College reviewed 30 correspondences provided by S.T.M., her parents and Dr. Aube. In reviewing that material, the College considered and applied their standards, bylaws and Code of Conduct provisions. They also noted that Dr. Aube, as

an author of a Section 211 report under the FLA , was not acting as a witness or advocate for either parent but assisting the Court in determining issues including the best interests of the child.

[298] The College stated that the complaint process is not a forum to address a complainants' disagreement with factual findings, conclusions or recommendations. The College does not conduct its own psychological assessment or substitute its professional opinion for those of a court appointed assessor. Its role is to focus on professional conduct and compliance with the Code of Conduct and that it is not within its investigative mandate to examine the substance of the underlying custody and access assessment or to make findings of fact.

[299] The College then summarized its evaluation of each of the enumerated allegations:

- a)  Bias - The College concluded that;
- I. Dr. Aube's overall approach in her interviews was reasonable and within professional standards. Her notes of the interviews appear to be consistent with the content of The Report and, there was no basis for regulatory criticism of the process utilized,
- II. Dr. Aube's practice record and The Report reflected her efforts to maintain parallel procedures in the assessment. A review of the file found The Report to be balanced and clear with respect to when Dr. Aube's professional opinions were being provided and when The Report described opinions or information provided by others. The assessment process and recommendations appear balanced with a clear focus on the best interests of the child;
- III. Dr. Aube's interaction with S.T.M.'s therapists did not include obtaining any clinical information and is not a basis for regulatory criticism,
- IV. It is within the professional discretion of a Section 211 report author to decide what specific information to include and although there may be disagreement with specific recommendations it does not, on its own,

indicate incompetence or misconduct. It is within Dr. Aube's discretion to ask any questions necessary to form the opinions and recommendations required for The Report,

- V. The examples of alleged bias raised by the [omitted for publication], when considered separately and cumulatively, did not support the allegation that Dr. Aube was biased against S.T.M.
- b)  Inadequate investigation - The College concluded that;
- I. S.T.M.'s allegations about C.G.H.'s physical abusiveness were not substantiated, even by her own description of their relationship, although she did allege financial abuse. The College's role is not to evaluate the veracity of any allegations about abusive behaviour. Dr. Aube's treatment of the abuse issue does not give rise to a concern about her professional conduct,
- II. The Report respectfully and appropriately included the views and experiences of B. and did so in consideration of Dr. Aube's obligation to conduct an assessment that focuses on the best interests of a child that may differ from the views of a child. It found no regulatory criticism of her on this issue,
- III. There was no basis to question Dr. Aube's entitlement to her professional judgement with regard to B.'s magical thinking and that such opinion is consistent with the professional literature,
- IV. There was no regulatory criticism of Dr. Aube's conduct on the issue of the Parties co-sleeping with B.,
- V. The weight given to certain factors in The Report is consistent with professional standards and it is not the job of the College substitute its own opinions regarding the weight given to information gathered and reviewed by Dr. Aube;
- c)  Errors, Misleading Statements and use of Demeaning Language The College concluded that:
- I. Dr. Aube acknowledged some factual errors in The Report but the College determined that the errors did not influence the recommendations made by Dr. Aube. It is not the College's role to adjudicate alleged factual errors

and they do not ordinarily support allegations of professional misconduct,

- II. S.T.M.'s contention that she did not discuss Family Court with B. differs from B.'s statement to Dr. Aube that S.T.M. told her the Courts say she can make the choice which suggests there were some discussions between them,
- III. The Report's treatment of abuse allegations in the Parties' relationship does not cause concern about her professional conduct,
- IV. The allegation of ambiguous and demeaning language overlaps with the bias allegation. Overall, The Report was balanced with a clear focus on B.'s best interests and the recommendations were consistent with the information gathered,
- d)  Unprofessional, Unethical and Aggressive Behaviour - The College concluded that:
- I. Even if S.T.M. experienced Dr. Aube's comments as upsetting or unprofessional such a reaction would not invalidate the assessment nor provide evidence of misconduct,
- II. Dr. Aube contacted two of S.T.M.'s therapists but after she withdrew her consent she had no further contact with them as part of the assessment;
- III. There was insufficient evidence to support allegations by S.T.M. that Dr. Aube was critical of her breastfeeding practices or accused her of lying about her past relationship,
- e)  Reliance on unapproved and false documents from C.G.H. - The College concluded that:
- I. Dr. Aube received correspondence from S.T.M.'s counsel about the contested documents and interpreted it to mean that S.T.M. would address her concerns during the interview process and in subsequent emails. Dr. Aube's response was consistent with her file notes and there were no regulatory criticisms.

[300] Although the College found no regulatory criticism of Dr. Aube's assessment and The Report, it felt that a review specifically about the issues of consent and a general

discussion of the M.'s allegations would benefit her in her ongoing work. Dr. Aube agreed to take those steps.

[301] Approximately two years after Dr. Aube completed The Report she testified at trial. After a review of her extensive and detailed curriculum vitae, she was qualified, without objection, as an expert in clinical and forensic psychology and in the preparation of Section 211 reports.

[302] Prior to her trial evidence, she reviewed Dr. Rocha's and Dr. Welder's reports as well as some other documents provided by counsel. Her evidence included:

- a)  She has been registered with the College since 1983. She has prepared over 400 Section 211 and similar reports. She has been qualified as an expert in the field of psychology around 70 times by the Courts in British Columbia;
- b)  She had received training in, was familiar with and performed assessments of people with ASD earlier in her career but she was not familiar with the revised testing procedures;
- c)  She concurred with Dr. Welder's conclusion that B. is high functioning on the ASD spectrum, described as Asperger's in the previous diagnostic manual. B. has some ASD features but they are extremely mild. Had B. been diagnosed at the time she was preparing and completing The Report it would not have changed her approach in gathering information from the Parties and B.;
- d)  ASD and parental alienation are two different things with different aspects and you cannot put them together. However, it may be more damaging to a child with ASD because they may be more sensitive;
- e)  It remains her opinion that parental alienation is present in the relationship between S.T.M. and B.;
- f) Given the present parenting schedule a move to an equal parenting time regime would be appropriate immediately because C.G.H. already has approximately 35% of B.'s parenting time;
- g)  In light of The Report and the additional documentation provided, it is essential that a parenting coordinator be appointed;
- h)  Parental alienation is very unhealthy because it is based on an unbalanced of the family dynamic and creates a lot of attachment

ambivalence between the child and the non-favoured parent and amounts to emotional abuse by the predominant parent;

- i) It is important that the Parties listen to and consider B.'s views and wishes. B. is very much aware of the discord between the Parties. It can be highly damaging and lead to cognitive, social and emotional damage. At her age, B. does not have the cognitive maturity and it would be harmful to her, to make decisions with regard to how much time she will spend with each Party. That decision should be made by the Parties;
- j) The College's determination regarding the M.'s complaint against her indicated that there is no finding of a violation of the Code of Conduct by her but that the matter would be resolved her having a consultation with another psychologist as directed by the College;
- k)  When she is retained to prepare a report, she expects that counsel agree on the documentation provided to her. As such, she did review the additional materials provided by C.G.H.'s counsel including C.G.H.'s draft affidavit. She did not list that affidavit as one of the documents she reviewed for The Report;
- l) She has no recollection of refusing to take all the documents S.T.M. wanted to provide to her response to C.G.H.'s draft affidavit;
- m) Although there is no specific reference to parental alienation in counsels' retainer letter it is the prerogative of the evaluator and a professional expectation to examine other appropriate topics and areas. C.G.H. raised the topic of parental alienation as one of his concerns though his main concern was that B. was not being protected from S.T.M.'s anxiety;
- n)  Her impression was that B. had been coached or prepared for the interview resulting in her reciting some things as if they were rote. B. repetitively expressed many things she did not like about C.G.H. but they were of little significance in the grand scheme of parenting. That is independent from and cannot be attributed to her ASD;
- o)  S.T.M. statements to B. that she didn't want B. to grow up were repeated by B. to her, Dr. Ambrose and C.G.H. and that was worrisome;
- p)  B.'s alienation from C.G.H. by S.T.M. was not initially intentional but when C.G.H. wished to become more involved in parenting, S.T.M.'s behaviour through her statements and subtle behaviours towards B., and her position that B. was not ready to spend more time with C.G.H., amounted to more purposeful interference. It is not B. that is not ready for equal parenting time with both Parties; it is S.T.M. that is not prepared for that to occur;

- q)  There is no doubt that S.T.M. and B. love each other very much and that S.T.M. has been a strong advocate for B. but not always in a positive way; and
- r) When B. expresses negative concerns about C.G.H. or his home it first has to be determined whether or not they are authentic and genuine as opposed to being a reflection of S.T.M.'s anxieties. A child will often raise issues to discredit the other parent to show loyalty to the favoured parent.

## Dr. Rocha

[303] Dr. Rocha is a Registered Psychologist who provides clinical psychological services to children and adolescents. The Parties had concerns around B.'s struggling to maintain focus and complete tasks and that she might be falling behind in her academic, social and emotional development. They retained Dr. Rocha to conduct a psychoeducational assessment on B. and provide a report.

[304] Dr. Rocha obtained a detailed personal and family history for B. and reviewed her educational history and performance. She noted that B. has had the benefit of tutoring assistance throughout her school career as well as support from a school assistance worker.

[305] She met with B. and had her participate in a variety of psychological assessments. She noted that B. used her best efforts in performing the various tasks assigned to her.

[306] Dr. Rocha's report detailed B.'s cognitive and academic strengths and weaknesses and recommended learning strategies to suit her specific needs at home and school. She noted that while B. was in the average range on some aspects of her neurodevelopmental profile she had several below average or impaired aspects that required immediate, concerted, and cooperative efforts by the Parties, the school system, tutors and other resource providers to enhance, as much as possible, B.'s opportunity for success.

[307] She stated that among her other mental health issues, B. has long-standing anxiety challenges. Based on her observations and other contributing factors, she suggested that B. may have a mild form of ASD and that there were overlapping symptomology challenges in working with children who may present with SAD, GAD and OCD.

[308] Dr. Rocha did not provide any recommendations concerning parenting time. She described how B.'s days should be structured to reduce her stress noting that although B. may have difficulties managing change, it did not mean that change should be avoided but rather that it should be done in a fashion to ensure consistency and predictability in her daily life.

## Ms. Paxton

[309] Ms. Paxton has a Master's degree in counselling psychology and is a Canadian Certified Counsellor. Since 2006, her practice has focussed primarily on children, families and partners of people with ASD. She was qualified as an expert in the areas of counselling individuals with ASD and counselling their family members.

[310] Ms. Paxton had no direct dealings with either of the Parties, their partners or B. She reviewed the letter of instruction provided by S.T.M.'s counsel, the reports of Dr. Rocha and Dr. Welder and The Report.

[311] Ms. Paxton described some common characteristics of persons with ASD including:

- a)  Difficulty with change and transitions typically among those more cognitively aware. Those difficulties can manifest in many ways including refusal to transition or taking a very long time to transition often with high levels of anxiety;
- b)  Anxiety which can manifest itself in trying to avoid or escape anxious situations or refusal to participate in anxious situations which can result in the person losing control of their behaviour and having either meltdowns or shutdowns;

- c)  Emotional deregulation including expressing stronger emotions, having difficulty regulating behaviour and calming themselves and becoming less able to think and less able to cope in many situations;
- d)  Difficulty in communication and socialization often resulting in having to prepare and preplan communication to the point where it almost seems scripted or rehearsed. Difficulty in social communication often results in the person appearing to be socially awkward or clumsy in their interactions with others; and
- e)  Sensory sensitivities and insensitivities including touch, sight, hearing, taste and smell that may be dysregulated or extreme.

[312] Ms. Paxton said that when she begins working with a new client or family there is no typical process but she begins by trying to get a history and to see, meet and get to know the people involved with the client to see what dynamics exist. The process is a flexible but she often investigates whether predictability and structure need to be reinforced because persons with ASD often need visual supports, such as making lists, rather than simply verbal communication or instructions.

- [313] Lack of preplanning with regard to transitions often results in an increase in anxiety if it is not well supported. The reactions of anxiety and panic result in fight, flight, freeze or fib behaviours resulting in aggressiveness, trying to escape the situation, becoming totally immobile, or providing some kind of rationalization about being unable to make a change. Unexpected changes often result in increased anxiety expressed by verbal behaviours or physical actions.
- [314] In her clinical experience, clients with ASD usually have some level of anxiety that may manifest in a variety of ways including OCD.
- [315] The hormonal changes of a child with ASD upon entering puberty tends to disregulate them and make it more difficult for them to manage their behaviour, thoughts and feelings.

[316] Many people with ASD have a key person who they gravitate towards often described as a 'point person.' For a child this tends to be one parent regardless of

whether or not the parents are separated or together. This orientation can be very hurtful to the parent who is not the point person. There is some speculation that the point person is often the mother because they tend to be more involved in the early stages and early years of the child's life. In her clinical experience up to 80% of her clients have a point person in their family.

[317] The relationship between the client and the non-point person can be enhanced to create bonds by a variety of methods including spending quality time and building positive memories around activities. It is beneficial for them to have shared experiences and interests.

[318] It would be helpful to assist a child client if the point person spoke positively about the other parent including encouraging the child think about the fun they will have with the other parent.

[319] Those at the higher end of ASD often have a very negative focus around what would otherwise seem to be a very happy activity or occasion. They may focus on one or two negative experiences that may seem unimportant to others. She spends considerable time with clients trying to alleviate the person's negative focus by providing positive CBT techniques.

[320] The parents themselves as well as the child determine the success of building a relationship between a child and the non-point person. When everyone is prepared to collaborate, success is much greater then when they are hostile towards each other.

[321] Some people with ASD focus on negative views of particular people. In those cases the person filters out all the positive experiences and focus only on the negative ones. This occurs in up to 98% of the clients she works with. What might seem insignificant or frivolous to others can be very significant to a person with ASD.

[322] She has worked with parenting coordinators regarding child clients with ASD on several occasions both as an advisor and to provide background information about ASD.

[323] In circumstances where separated parents are in conflict the chances of being able to help a child bond more closely with the non-point parent is far less likely to happen. It is a multiparty process. It is more successful when the non-point parent's time with the child is spent doing things the child really enjoys as a cornerstone of building a positive.

[324] Some people with ASD will display emotional mirroring, will reflect or adapt the emotions of someone else around them, and may on occasion magnify those emotions. If a person with ASD is around a person with high anxiety on a regular basis, they may well display anxiety themselves at an elevated level.

[325] Addressing negative focus views on the part of a person with ASD can be very complicated and a somewhat individualized process with many different strategies that can be employed.

[326] It would be of assistance in dealing with the child's negative focus for the parent having the positive experience with the child sharing photographs or videos of that experience so that the other parent can reinforce the positivity of the situation. Videos and photos help the parents to point out to the child that they were having fun though there might have been minor negative experience during the day.

[327] In general, it would be better if transitions were less frequent because the changes are often very stressful. Children with ASD are no different in some ways from neuro-typical peers. They gain and lose interest in activities from time to time but a person with ASD sometimes has a stronger response to getting involved in the activity and then similar negative response when they finish or decide they do not want to participate in the activity.

[328] Sometimes people with ASD tend to compartmentalize in the sense that what they do in one location they are not readily able to transfer to a different location.

## Dr. Gamache

[329] Dr. Gamache has a PhD in Counselling Psychology and previously practised as a clinical counsellor.

[330] Dr. Gamache was qualified to give an expert opinion on the following topics:

- a)  Children and families going through separation, divorce and remarriage;
- b)  The Reunification and Co-parenting in High Conflict and Complexity (REACH);
- c)  FST; and
- d)  Parental alienation.

[331] She reviewed The Report, Dr. Welder's assessment and the August 13, 2020 Reasons for Judgment.

[332] She has been in practice since 2001 and is a co-founder of and the Program Director for REACH, a collaborative divorce coach, child specialist mediator and media consultant. REACH was founded in collaboration a number of professionals including lawyers, therapists and psychologists and in consultation with a Supreme Court Justice to develop a therapeutic practice model in 2015.

[333] She also has experience with alienated children and parents through her practice as a marriage and family therapist specializing in separation, divorce and remarriage. She has specialized training and experience and works with groups developing literature, programs and other tools for professionals working with separated and alienated families.

[334] She and the REACH team often work with families after a Section 211 Report has been prepared. Working from the report, therapeutic interventions are developed in

consultation with the parents and the child with the goal that the child should have the best possible relationship in a family with the least amount of conflict possible. A finding in a report of alienation informs the process they undertake. Wherever possible the REACH team engages senior practitioners to work on resistance/refuse situations.

[335] C.G.H. contacted her in July 2020 and she met with him and T.C., via Zoom, concerning the family situation and B. She has never met S.T.M. or B.

[336] She described FST as the engagement and treatment of a group of people who have inter-related relationships that are all mutually influencing. There has to be a 360° view of the whole family in circumstances where alienation is an issue because one of the characteristics of alienation is that the narratives of the different parties are so different that it becomes hard to know really what is going on.

[337] FST would also take into account individual characteristics such as an ASD diagnosis. FST has the capacity to narrow in on a specific area and then to back out and see how it relates to the whole family's circumstances.

[338] FST utilizes theories, techniques and knowledge to understand in a holistic way how the whole family functions and to attempt to improve communication between the various members of the family so that it can function better to create a healthy environment for children.

[339] At its core, FST treats the family as a whole but does not deny there are individuals that bring influence and concerns forward. FST is there to help create support fundamental attachments between children and their parents so that the child can stand solidly in their own developmental trajectory without being worried about what the parents are going to say when they move from one home to the other. Those types of worries distract the child and can bring tremendous anxiety on them.

[340] In FST there is a prevalent view that there needs to be a team for the family where there are entrenched relationships so that each party can have a direct

therapeutic relationship with one person and the team can come together to work through the challenges of a damaged relationship such as alienation, also known as the resist/refuse dynamic.

[341] Some people are resistant to using FST because they do not want experts looking at what is going on inside the family, so the therapy has to begin with a court order. It could feel very vulnerable for the participants. However, a child would receive the message that there are people who care about the family, including the therapists and the Judge determining matters.

[342] FST can be expensive with the retainer required for each member of the team with a timeline of approximately one year or more.

[343] She believes that C.G.H., S.T.M. and B. could be assisted through FST. She would recommend the team led by Marianne Cottingham from Langley who has 13 different therapists involved in her practice including one who has been a behavioural interventionist with ASD children. She also uses therapy dogs.

## Dr. Welder

[344] Dr. Welder is a Registered Psychologist retained by the Parties in late 2020 to conduct an ASD assessment on B. after considering Dr. Rocha's report and Dr. Ambrose's views. She did not give evidence at trial.

[345] Dr. Welder obtained background information about B. and the Parties from a variety of sources. She administered a number of ASD diagnostic tests. Her report detailed those test results and her interpretation of them.

[346] Based on the information provided and the test results, Dr. Welder's conclusion was that B.'s circumstances supported a diagnosis of ASD, referred to as Asperger's under previous criteria. In support of that diagnosis she noted the following particular to B.'s circumstances:

- a)  Challenges and aspects of social communication and social interaction;
- b)  Focused, all-encompassing areas of interest; and
- c)  Difficulties with transition/change and some sensory issues.
- d)  Dr. Welder also provided a series of recommendations included:
- e)  An individualized education plan (IEP) with an ASD framework;
- f) Working to increase B.'s social thinking;
- g)  Working on B.'s emotional regulation using CBT;
- h)  Facilitating B.'s understanding of social interactions;
- i) Working with B. on hygiene, staying healthy, dealing with anxiety, finding and keeping friends and social media use;
- j) Obtaining community support through the Children and Youth with Special Needs (CYSN) division of MCFD;
- k)  Accessing Autism Information Services BC (AISBC) administered by MCFD as a resource available to assist persons with ASD and their families; and
- l) That the Parties continue education about ASD and supports available in the community and the province including connecting to support groups and other resources.

[347] S.T.M. said that based on Dr. Welder's report she has done a lot of reading and research about ASD and has organized her home to assist B. in her day-to-day functioning. She has also registered with Autism BC and obtained information from them and attended seminars.

[348] Some of the changes to her home to assist B. included a special room for B. to decompress when she is feeling stressed which includes bright colours, a sensory swing and a stereo to play loud music.

[349] C.G.H. said that he has also taken a number of steps to educate himself about ASD and obtain assistance from a variety of resources to assist him in better understanding B.'s situation and how he may work to enhance their relationship.

## OTHER WITNESSES

## T.C.

[350] T.C. is a [omitted for publication] familiar with the care of [omitted for publication] and practices part-time on a schedule of her choosing. She also owns and operates an [omitted for publication] in Prince George.

[351] She has no children but has been involved with children throughout her adult life. She has extended family in Prince George including her parents, her sister and her family and cousins.

[352] She described her relationship with C.G.H. as being an excellent, loving relationship and they are good friends as well as partners. He is supportive of her personal and professional goals. C.G.H. is generally a calm, easy-going person and she has only seen him angry on a couple of occasions. He has shown emotions arising from the difficulties in his relationship with B. and S.T.M. and the toll of the litigation.

## [353] Her evidence concerning B. included:

- a)  When they met she knew C.G.H. had time with B. on weekends and he was very careful on how she was introduced to B. including consulting Dr. Ambrose and then having them interact in a variety of social settings. Once his fieldwork had ended he wanted to have B. more frequently but that was not facilitated;
- b)  C.G.H. is a devoted and loving parent and his top priority is B.'s happiness and development. B. often puts up barriers to success in their relationship. They are obvious when B. shuts down in her interactions with them at their home;
- c)  She was present for several of the unsuccessful Sunday parenting time exchanges. She was also there for one successful exchange at Easter when B. came without any complaint. B. was very excited about an Easter egg hunt on that day;
- d)  In October 2019, she was asked by S.T.M. to spend some time with B. because she was having some female problems. They spent the entire day together shopping and doing other activities and she did not notice any symptoms or difficulties for B. Later that night S.T.M. complained that B. had been urinating in her clothing all day. She saw no signs of that and she is quite familiar with the smell of urine. The next day

S.T.M. told her and C.G.H. that B. did have an infection. Had she known that she would've taken B. to the doctor immediately;

- e)  S.T.M. gave her permission to treat [omitted for publication]' urinary infection. They told B. what was happening and that [omitted for publication] would be fine. Later that evening S.T.M. texted them saying that B. was hiding in the corner crying because she thought [omitted for publication] was going to die. They went downstairs to see how B. was doing and she was playing with the friends she had over and had not been in the corner crying;
- f) She has observed a few alarming interactions between C.G.H. and S.T.M. including one in S.T.M.'s driveway and another at a Sunday exchange when S.T.M. insisted that C.G.H. take B. out of her car. When he declined to do so, she left the area. Later S.T.M. advised that she had a friend videotape the incident;
- g)  After the August 2020 Order, C.G.H.'s time with B. increased and for several months. B. seemed to enjoy the new arrangements;
- h)  When B. is with them, they engage in many activities such as swimming, snowmobiling, going on hikes and other fun things. B. appears to have fun with these activities;
- i) After B. has had a good time doing one of their activities she often becomes extremely stressed and retreats to the bathroom to communicate with S.T.M. She believes that B. feels guilty about the fact she had a good time with C.G.H. and that it will somehow impact her relationship with S.T.M.;
- j) On New Year's Eve of 2020, B. was with them. When she arrived, she was very unhappy and withdrawn. Later in the evening, they were watching a movie that B. had picked out. While sitting right next to her, B. texted S.T.M. that she was in the closet crying which was not the case;
- k)  Since the summer of 2021 B. no longer smiles when her picture is taken; as if she does not want to show that she is having a good time when she is with C.G.H.;
- l) Since 2021 B. seems to have disengaged from many of her friends who used to come for sleepovers. In addition, she seems very reluctant to engage with other children in their neighbourhood;
- m) B. was involved in the YMCA program during the summer of 2021. She really enjoyed it and the children she was with really enjoyed her;
- n)  In light of B.'s challenges, she is in the impossible situation where she has to please S.T.M. and by pleasing S.T.M., she has to hate C.G.H. The crux of the problem is that B. behaves differently in each of the

two homes. When she is their home she seems relaxed and is having fun and acting in a normal fashion but then she communicates with S.T.M. saying that she's having a horrible time and she needs to be rescued;

- o)  She and C.G.H. are unable to exercise any discipline or authority, over B. when she is at their home. B. misreports to S.T.M. anything they try to do and S.T.M. raises allegations against them. In addition, S.T.M. actively tries to undermine what little boundaries they set for B. All this means they are unable to establish any healthy boundaries for B.;
- p)  She has a very good relationship with B. but she does not try to elevate that relationship to make B. feel uncomfortable. She wants to be a good role model for B. She is not a disciplinarian with B. and wants to be a resource for her;
- q)  At Dr. Ambrose's suggestion, she started texting B. regularly. B. did not respond very often and she determined that B. might be feeling pressure or stress while she is at S.T.M.'s not to communicate with C.G.H. or her. She has reduced the number of texts she sends to B.; and
- r) B. is an innately sweet, loving person who does not want to upset or hurt anyone and wants to be loved by everyone.
- [354] Her evidence about vacation trips with B. included:
- a)  Early in 2019, she, C.G.H. and B. spent several nights at a hotel in Vancouver and they took B. to a number of attractions. The hotel had an indoor-outdoor pool that B. enjoyed;
- b)  On another occasion, they took B. to the Lower Mainland for a family celebration of life. They realized that might be boring for B. so they took her to a large water attraction;
- c)  In 2019 she, C.G.H. and B. went on a brief vacation to Kelowna where they did a lot of activities that B. seemed interested in and enjoyed;
- d)  Later that fall they also took B. to Barkerville, which she appeared to enjoy. On that trip, B. forgot her medication and became quite upset about it. They checked on a couple of websites and were satisfied that missing one dose would not be a problem. When S.T.M. found out about the missed dose she was very upset;
- e)  On one of the trips in 2019, B. became very upset and began vomiting because she was fearful that S.T.M. was not okay. It took considerable reassurance by her and C.G.H. to get B. calmed down and realize that S.T.M. was fine;

- f) In 2020, she and C.G.H. became aware that there is an opportunity for B. to go on a school trip to Québec. C.G.H. supported that idea. However, B. did not go and later S.T.M. said that B. did not go because C.G.H. did not support the idea;
- g)  Instead, B. and S.T.M. went on a trip to Scotland during spring break. When they returned Covid had arrived. C.G.H. was supposed to have one week with B. during spring break but that did not occur;
- h)  She does not know what other holiday activities B. takes with S.T.M. because if she ever asked the about such things a wall is put up and B. refuses to discuss them; and
- i) In the fall of 2020, they took B. on a brief vacation to Penticton. On that trip, S.T.M. pressured them to include [omitted for publication] although that was not appropriate. The weather was very hot and there was no place for [omitted for publication] because dogs were not permitted at the campground. [omitted for publication] barked so much they had to take her out of the hotel room they rented but they were able to find a doggy day care for her.

[355] T.C. said she is aware that B. has high functioning ASD. Before B. was diagnosed she and C.G.H. met with Dr. Ambrose and discussed some of the symptoms she had noticed to be indicative of ASD. Dr. Ambrose recommended that B. get privately assessed in order to obtain a quicker diagnosis and they agreed.

[356] Some of her knowledge about ASD comes from her sister who has worked with special needs children her entire career. She and C.G.H. also gained knowledge reading a number of books and articles recommended to them by Dr. Welder. She is also a member of a stepmothers support group for children with high functioning ASD.

[357] She and C.G.H. have tried to set up their home to make it comfortable for B. including permitting her to set up her room the way she wanted, having the necessary stimulus items and making sure there is food that B. likes in the home when she is there.

[358] She and C.G.H. have also spent a great deal of time consulting with both Dr. Ambrose and Dr. Gamache about steps they can take in things they can do to make B. more comfortable in their home.

## W.C.

[359] W.C. is T.C.'s mother. She was previously employed with MCFD and as a school counsellor. She has a Master's degree in educational counselling and has extensive experience in dealing with and teaching disabled children in a variety of environments.

[360] She said C.G.H. is a wonderful person with a great sense of humour who is very good to her daughter. T.C. and C.G.H. love each other and they are supportive to each other as partners.

[361] She has known B. since December 2018. B. is a good conversationalist who likes to cuddle with C.G.H. and watch movies. C.G.H., T.C. and B. play games both inside and outside the home. C.G.H. is a doting father and very involved with B.'s activities when she is at his home; particularity taking care of the animals.

[362] B. has certain challenges but she is not aware of the diagnosis. C.G.H. and T.C. work hard to be supportive and address B.'s challenges and they have created an environment to make her feel comfortable in their home.

[363] She noticed that since B. has become a teenager she is more unwilling to comply with C.G.H.'s requests. She is not sure whether that is because B. is a teenager or acting with an awareness of the acrimony between the Parties.

[364] She believes B. is in a difficult situation because she lives in two realities, one with S.T.M. and one with C.G.H. She is trying to figure out her emotional attachments in both situations. When B. is with C.G.H., she often speaks of S.T.M. One of the things she says quite often is that her fear is that S.T.M. will die of a broken heart.

## D.T.

[365] D.T. is a friend, a former co-worker and now an employee of C.G.H.'s. He said C.G.H. was a very good paramedic with lots of experience, empathy and ability in dealing with children in stressful situations.

[366] C.G.H. took more time off during S.T.M.'s pregnancy and after B. was born to help care for her. C.G.H. was a very happy father and participated in B.'s care.

[367] Over the years, he has seen B. he has noticed her to be a generally happy child but when it is time for her to return home to S.T.M., she becomes withdrawn, distant, and stressed and would often just sit by herself. The only time he has seen B. act oddly when she is with C.G.H. is just about the time she is to return home.

[368] His family was with C.G.H. and B. in Penticton in 2019. B. was smearing a lot of sunscreen on her face. He and his wife approached B. and said that doing so is not healthy but B. said she had to do it, telling them 'this keeps me close to my mom because my mom's heart breaks when I'm not with her' and later B. said, 'My mom said this keeps me close to her'. That was not the only time B. made similar comments.

## V.B.

[369] V.B. and S.T.M. have a close relationship. She lives with her family in Prince George and her son and B. are good friends. She is B.'s piano teacher. Their families regularly share family social events; she sees S.T.M. and B. regularly and sometimes cares for B.

[370] Prior to S.T.M. and C.G.H. separating, she would socialize regularly with S.T.M. but C.G.H. was often not present. Activities for her children and B., particularly in the summer, were planned with S.T.M. with no involvement from C.G.H.

[371] C.G.H. was a good brother-in-law but after he and S.T.M. separated he was no longer part of their family and they have had limited contact since.

[372] After the separation S.T.M. was accommodating of C.G.H.'s wish to spend time with B. particularly during the summer months when he was busy working out of town. S.T.M. tried to help B. feel more comfortable in C.G.H.'s home including shopping for

clothes for her, decorating her room there and assisting B. in caring for C.G.H.'s animals when he was away.

[373] B. expressed not feeling comfortable at C.G.H.'s home soon after he bought his first home. B. had many worries that she did not feel like she could talk to C.G.H. about. B. would often speak to her about missing S.T.M. and not being able to talk to her. Since acquiring a cell phone B. carries it with her constantly and frequently calls S.T.M. When B. is at her home, she will call S.T.M. several times throughout the day about a range of topics including her many worries. When B. has worries, she likes to speak to S.T.M. and they are very interconnected.

[374] B. has related to her incidents involving C.G.H. including:

- a)  B. broke a candle in her bathroom at C.G.H.'s home. She was mumbling when trying to explain it to him. He told her to 'spit it out' and when she did not speak in a normal voice she was sent to her room which upset her;
- b)  When they have Chinese food for supper at C.G.H.'s home he insisted that B. try eating it with a fork instead of with her hands and she responded by not eating any dinner at all. Later, just before bed she was hungry and had some toast and yogurt but he told her it wasn't healthy to snack before bedtime so she was worried about that; and
- c)  When C.G.H. bought an electric piano for B., he required her to wear headphones when she played which she interpreted that to mean that he did not want to listen to her play. B. was unaware that C.G.H. and T.C. work from home and she tried to reassure B. that C.G.H. loved her playing.

## [375] Based on her experience there are certain situations that affect B. including:

- a)  If she sees information about germs, diseases or bad news she fixates on that information and needs to talk to S.T.M. about it;
- b)  She needs to watch movies geared to younger persons because many otherwise age-appropriate movies are too frightening for her;
- c)  She is very frightened of homeless people;
- d)  She needs to have a plan for activities throughout the day and any changes to the plans are very upsetting. She retreats, often into the

## D.H.

[376] D.H.'s evidence not set out elsewhere included:

- a)  On Christmas Eve 2016, he was aware that S.T.M. and B. were going to C.G.H.'s home for the evening and that B. would be staying overnight. He does not know if S.T.M. spent the night there as well;
- b)  In March 2017, after he had moved in with S.T.M. she told him that C.G.H. was communicating with her to have sex with her but he was not aware of the content of their text messaging;
- c)  When he moved in with S.T.M. in 2017, B. was in the home practically all the time. She spent infrequent, sporadic, last minute and unscheduled times with C.G.H. Later in 2017, the schedule became more regular;
- d)  From when he first moved in, he observed that B. struggled and protested about having to spend time with C.G.H. Sometimes she would run to her room and climb under the bed. In the days before she was scheduled to go to C.G.H.'s, she would have extreme anxiety including panic attacks, crying, vomiting, and being unable to sleep. B. would often say she did not wish to go to C.G.H.'s and that she did not
5. bathroom, to call S.T.M. to take her home when there has been a change in plans;
- e)  Both tone and volume are important when communicating with B. and if she detects any sense of anger or displeasure she becomes very upset;
- f) She will talk about her worries and some happy times but it is about 90% worries and 10% happy times;
- g)  she often says that she believes C.G.H. does not love her but is reassured by others telling her that her parents love her and that parents aren't perfect;
- h)  When B. comes to piano lessons after a weekend with C.G.H., she is exhausted. B. seems to have a lot of anxiety getting ready to spend time at C.G.H.'s home; and
- i) S.T.M. is very generous with her time and makes sure that B. gets to all of her appointments and activities. S.T.M. assists B. with her homework and is always available for B. including responding to her late-night communications. She encourages B.'s interests, to be herself and to be the best kind of person she can without fitting into any sort of mold.

feel safe. B. would tell S.T.M. that she hated her for making her go to C.G.H.'s home;

- e)  S.T.M. spent considerable time calming B. down and explaining to her that it was important for her to spend time with C.G.H. After spending time with C.G.H., B. would often need time to play music, spend time with [omitted for publication] and just relax. Once Dr. Ambrose started working with B. her expressed anxiety about going to C.G.H.'s home reduced;
- f) S.T.M. spent a lot of time gathering information on trying to help B. through her anxiety and other behaviours. Dr. Ambrose affirmed that S.T.M. was doing was the right thing to assist B.;
- g)  In May 2018 when B.'s time with C.G.H. was Friday after school until Saturday afternoon her anxious behaviour diminished and her stress was greatly reduced. In addition, B. seem to be more relaxed during her time with C.G.H.;
- h)  When B. was told about the FCC Order with a dramatic change in the time she was spending with C.G.H. she cried hysterically and locked herself in her room;
- i) B. adapted to the Friday night to Saturday parenting time with C.G.H. but with the additional time being added she regressed and returned to not being able to sleep. S.T.M. engaged the assistance of the school counsellor who worked with B. to get her ready for her Tuesday and Friday parenting times with C.G.H.;
- j) The Sunday parenting times were very problematic because B. would not get to sleep until late Saturday night after returning from C.G.H. When she woke up on Sunday morning she would be very reluctant to go back. He and S.T.M. put enormous effort into convincing B. to get in the car to go to the exchange location for her Sunday parenting time with C.G.H.;
- k)  On the first occasion S.T.M. went with B. to the exchange they returned shortly after in tears and B. told him that she was afraid to go because C.G.H. had been mean to S.T.M.;
- l) On the second Sunday, he surreptitiously went to the exchange location and watched what occurred. He saw C.G.H. patrolling around the car with his chest puffed out laughing at S.T.M., pointing his finger at her in a hostile manner and saying to her 'how many lawyer letters do you want' Both B. and S.T.M. were crying. Later in the day he discussed what he saw with S.T.M. and they agreed that things might go better if he took B. to the next Sunday exchange;

- m) The next Sunday there was a real struggle by S.T.M. to get B. into his car. On the way to the exchange, he told B. that it was important for her to spend time with C.G.H. and she said okay. However, by the time they got to the exchange location B. had shut down and acted very calm. When they pulled up next to C.G.H.'s vehicle, she told him that she was not going. C.G.H. replied that she had to come because of the court order but she refused and said she wanted to go home. He did not think it was his place to try to physically force B. out of the car so he took her home and it took her over an hour to calm down;
- n)  The next Sunday B. again protested going to C.G.H. By the time they got to the exchange location, B. started to exhibit extreme anxiety and when they arrived, she again told C.G.H. she was not going with him. C.G.H. became very upset. He and B. had a brief dialogue and then he and C.G.H. spoke briefly outside the car so B. would not hear. They had a cordial exchange but C.G.H. started to ask him personal questions and the conversation ended. He returned to his car and took B. home. Later that day S.T.M. sent an email to C.G.H. to try to discuss how things might be able to change because what was occurring was not working for B.;
- o)  Throughout December 2019 and January and February 2020, he continued to take B. to the exchange location on Sunday mornings. The routine each Sunday was roughly the same with B. being very uncooperative about getting into the car and her telling C.G.H. that she did not want to go is some when they arrived. On several occasions C.G.H. became upset saying words like 'it's your mother's fault, it's all your mother's fault she told you to do this. I have court ordered time you have to come with me now it's my time.'
- p)  Getting B. to feel comfortable about a situation often requires a great deal of 'preloading' as she does not adjust well to spontaneous matters. B. did go with C.G.H. on the occasional Sunday particularly on Father's Day 2020 because they had plenty of time to 'preload' her and get her used to the idea;
- q)  He took B. to all of the Sunday exchanges through until the summer of 2020. On all occasions, S.T.M. encouraged B. to spend time with C.G.H. both on the day of the exchange and the night before. At no time did he see S.T.M. tell B. that it was her choice about seeing C.G.H.;
- r) On the drive to each exchange, he encouraged B. to go with C.G.H. On each occasion, he permitted C.G.H. to speak to B. They would speak to each other through the windows of the respective vehicles. On several occasions, C.G.H. was very aggressive at the exchanges.

He did not physically force B. to get out of his car because that would have destroyed the trust he had built up with her;

- s)  The routine was the same except for on April 26, 2020, when C.G.H. was waiting outside his vehicle with T.C. She was videotaping the event. This change of routine upset B. C.G.H. was loud and insisted on getting into his car. C.G.H.'s actions intimidated him. He told B. to go with C.G.H. but B. became very upset and started screaming so they left the area;
- t) At the Sunday exchanges, C.G.H. offered no alternative ideas to try to convince B. to spend some time with him. On one occasion in July 2020, B. said that she wanted some weekends with S.T.M. as well. C.G.H. replied well how about one week with me and one week with your mom and B. yelled out 'no.'
- u)  After the August 2020 Order, B.'s adverse reactions to going to C.G.H.'s home reduced from lasting several days down to the night before with B. regularly inquiring as to what would happen at C.G.H.'s home. Since the new schedule went from three days to five days, B. would return exhausted from her time with C.G.H. B. still struggles with getting into a proper sleep pattern when she is with C.G.H.;
- v)  B. told him that she did not want to go to C.G.H.'s home because she does not feel safe there because he has no colour in his home particularly in her bedroom;
- w)  It is not correct to say that the primary issue between C.G.H. and S.T.M. is parenting time with B. because there is a lot more to the dynamics with B. including who she is and what she needs. It is very complicated;
- x)  S.T.M. spent considerable time preloading B. about the vacation in Scotland before they went in 2020;
- y)  B. is not absolutely loyal to S.T.M.'s needs and she is her own independent person; and
- z)  As far as he is aware, B. does not keep secrets. If B. was keeping information from C.G.H. about him and his sons living with them that may speak to the dynamic between her and C.G.H.

## [377] D.H.'s evidence about ASD included:

- a)  Since B.'s diagnosis he gathered a lot of information through reading books and watching videos and that has given him much better understanding of B.'s behaviours including anxieties, selective mutism, depression and sensory issues;

## R.M.

[378] For most of his life, R.M. and his wife have operated a farm in the [omitted for publication] area. After S.T.M. and C.G.H. commenced their relationship, he accepted C.G.H. as a member of their family with many benefits and privileges only given to family members. He and his wife would see S.T.M. and C.G.H. on a regular basis and travel to [omitted for publication] from time to time to help them.

[379] He and his wife assisted during S.T.M.'s pregnancy with B. Their seven grandchildren are very important to them. They met B. soon after she was born and they visited with S.T.M. and B. both at [omitted for publication] and on many occasions when S.T.M. and B. came to stay with them on the family farm. C.G.H. would occasionally come on the visits.

[380] S.T.M. is an excellent mother from B.'s birth to the present. C.G.H. was initially a little standoffish and had limited participation in B.'s parenting before the separation although he expressed strong views on the topic. C.G.H. made it clear to him that B.'s care was taking up too much time.

- [381] When S.T.M. and C.G.H. moved to Prince George, he and his wife would see them more frequently and would stay with them.

[382] After the separation, he sent an email to C.G.H. telling him to reconcile his relationship with S.T.M. or he would cease being a member of their family. Since then he has had very little contact with C.G.H. He believes that C.G.H. does not love B.

- b)  Since the diagnoses they have added lots of colour to B.'s environment including putting a special room in the basement where she can spend her time playing and listening to music, being with her stuffed animals, and relaxing; and
- c)  From the information he has obtained any of B.'s challenges relate back to ASD including such things as insuring that B. feel safe, has a solid schedule and routine that cannot be deviated from until she warms up to it over time.

[383] B. does have challenges and S.T.M. has continuously worked hard to address them as they arise including meeting with numerous professionals and using their advice to work with B.

[384] He has never seen S.T.M. discourage B. from spending time with C.G.H., or speak ill of him. After the separation, S.T.M. made numerous efforts to encourage C.G.H. to spend time with B. including offering to moving closer to C.G.H. to order to facilitate joint parenting time but he did not appear to be very interested.

[385] B. is an amazing girl with many interesting and definite skills in interacting with others. She has views on a number of topics and she is succinct and to the point in expressing those views. She does have difficulty adjusting to changes in routine when she expresses anxiety and disappointment and when unexpected changes occur she becomes very silent and subdued.

## S.T.

[386] S.T. is a retired member of the [omitted for publication]. She has known S.T.M. since S.T.M. transferred to Prince George. They are good friends and see each other regularly. She described S.T.M. as a very loving, compassionate caring parent and a truthful and honest person. She has never seen S.T.M. discouraging B. from, or doing anything that would be harmful to B. having a relationship with C.G.H.

[387] Her eldest son is the same age as B. Her children are good friends with B. and they once attended the same school and in some cases, the same class. She regularly saw S.T.M. and B. at school functions and concerts but C.G.H. did not attend nearly as often.

[388] She is an acquaintance of C.G.H.'s because B. and her children are friends and see each other at each other's homes including having sleepovers; almost exclusively when C.G.H. has his parenting time with B. She has limited opportunity to witness a

relationship between B. and C.G.H. Her daughter told her that C.G.H. asks many questions when she visits there which she finds quite invasive.

[389] B. has told her that she feels more comfortable sleeping at her home then at C.G.H.'s where she spends a lot of time by herself. She has not seen B. exhibit any anxieties in her home but has seen those anxieties in B. at school. Her anxieties lessened after she started taking prescription medication.

[390] During the Shotgun Incident, she spoke to her daughter and later to C.G.H. who assured her all was well and the shotgun would be properly stored. She did not report the matter and was not aware of any investigations undertaken by the RCMP. Her daughter continues to have sleepovers with B. at C.G.H.'s home and she has no ongoing safety concerns.

## J.B.

[391] J.B. has been S.T.M.'s friend for over 20 years. He said S.T.M. is like a sister to him and B. is like his niece. S.T.M. is a protective, caring and loving mother and goes out of her way to ensure that B. gets all of the resources she needs to be successful. He sees them intermittently sometimes up to four times per month and less in other months.

[392] He does many activities with B. when he visits including games, hanging out and spending time with [omitted for publication]. When B. visits his home, they enjoy each other's company and she does not appear to be anxious. He is aware that B. has some challenges with anxiety, which she exhibited during some conversations where she talks about going to C.G.H.'s home. B. has told him that C.G.H. does not like her calling S.T.M. when she is with him and that the rules in each household are different. From his observations, B. appears very mature for her age. She is smart, methodical and a good joker.

## B.'s PARTICIPATION

[393] On March 22, 2022, B. filed an Information Form for Appointment of a Lawyer for Child that was brought to the Court's attention when the Parties appeared on March 23, 2022.

[394] On April 26, 2022, B. filed an Application for Case Management Order seeking the appointment of a lawyer for her through the Child and Youth Legal Centre (CYLC).

[395] On May 5, 2022, I granted an order appointing a lawyer to present her Application to have a lawyer appointed for her in the litigation.

[396] On August 25, 2022, I heard B.'s Application to have a lawyer appointed through the CYLC. C.G.H. opposed and S.T.M. endorsed the Application.

[397] On September 8, 2022, I appointed a lawyer through the CYLC to represent B.'s interests in the litigation. That lawyer was Mr. Gregory Petrisor, KC. Those Reasons for Judgement are reported at 2022 BCPC 302.

[398] The order appointing Mr. Petrisor as counsel for B. permitted him to review the contents of the file including:

- a)  The pleadings;
- b)  The evidence presented by the Parties including the numerous volumes of documents, affidavits and the transcripts of the trial; and
- c)  The various Reasons for Judgement and Orders.

[399] Mr. Petrisor met with B. on several occasions to obtain information and her instructions including background information, the present parenting time schedule, B.'s present relationship with and time spent with the Parties, B.'s relationship with extended family members and her views on future parenting time.

[400] Based on the information available to him from the Court file and his meetings with B., Mr. Petrisor determined that the best way to present B.'s views was through a

written summary on various topics and B.'s position concerning her parenting time with each of the Parties. That summary included that B.:

- a)  Is in Grade 9 and is doing well in most of her school subjects. She would like to become a teacher of young students;
- b)  Is interested in music and plays the piano. She also enjoys dancing, playing video games and activities with her friends. She has three close friends;
- c)  Enjoys chores including caring for pets and farm animals. She earns money by selling eggs, dog walking and babysitting;
- d)  Finds comfort in the company of animals because they do not judge her, like a good friend;
- e)  Sees herself as a sensitive person who likes to help others;
- f) Is a high functioning person with ASD. She tries to avoid overstimulation particularly too much noise or very loud sounds and struggles with sudden or unexpected changes. She functions better with routine and predictability. She needs to know what is happening and what she has to deal with in advance;
- g)  Has regular parenting time with C.G.H. on alternate weeks from Thursday after school until the immediate following Tuesday at the beginning of school and on alternate Thursdays from after school until 7 PM;
- h)  Had summer parenting time with C.G.H. from August 13 - 22, 2022. She did not have enough notice of that trip to mentally prepare and it was a source of significant stress that made her unhappy. She contemplated suicide during that trip including trying to determine the least painful way to end her life. Those thoughts ended after the trip and she has not contemplated suicide since;
- i) Can relax, keep busy, have fun and be herself at S.T.M.'s home. She has activities at S.T.M.'s home including chores, dog walking, babysitting, outdoor activities, visiting with friends, going to church, relaxing, and talking with S.T.M. Her chores include caring for animals, maintaining her room, household duties and shovelling snow. She appreciates the structure in S.T.M.'s home and knowing what she can expect in her day-to-day routine because S.T.M.'s expectations of her are clear;
- j) Spends her time at C.G.H.'s home trying not to be alone with him. She does chores including maintaining her room, doing dishes and her own laundry. She does not sleep well at C.G.H.'s home because she feels

constant stress while there and about having to go there. The stress interferes with her concentration and the grades she receives in school on days she is with C.G.H. or about to go to his home. She does not often have homework but on those occasions S.T.M. helps her but at C.G.H.'s home she does the assignments alone in her room;

- k)  Plays the piano at both S.T.M. and C.G.H.'s home. She believes that C.G.H. requires her to wear headphones when practising or playing the piano in his home which she does not like;
- l) Has home cooked meal at S.T.M.'s home but eats out, has takeout or frozen prepared meals at C.G.H.'s home;
- m) When in S.T.M.'s car they talk frequently. When in C.G.H.'s car the radio is usually playing and she avoids conversations that will upset him such as when she does not get as high a grade in a class as he expects;
- n)  Likes attending doctor's appointment with S.T.M. because she permits her speaking to the doctor alone. She feels that if C.G.H. takes her to an appointment he will be angry if she asked to speak to the doctor privately;
- o)  Loves S.T.M. and believes S.T.M. loves her unconditionally. S.T.M. is patient when she does not understand something or has difficulty knowing what a person is thinking or feeling by remaining calm and reassuring. She can talk to S.T.M. comfortably about both good and bad things that happen. If S.T.M. is not available she would approach aunt or her grandmother M. S.T.M. knows how to have fun, respects her and really knows her. On occasion when they do have disagreements they are able to deal with them easily;
- p)  Feels stressed when she asks C.G.H. if he is mad at her and he gets pushy and upset and tells her she has to push through whatever is troubling her. She cannot say that she loves C.G.H. or that she believes he loves her. During a recent argument, C.G.H. asked her if she hated him and she replied 'yes'. She would not say that without prompting but did not want to lie to him;
- q)  Identified several examples of where C.G.H. has been either unsupportive or angry with her including the wearing of headphones in school, preparing for a costumed theme day at summer camp and forcing her to cancel prearranged babysitting or dog sitting appointments such that some of her existing clients have stopped using her. C.G.H. will not permit her to book dog walking or babysitting appointments for people he does not know when she is at his home;
- r) Gets lectured by C.G.H. about ASD and he tells her she needs to 'get rid of it' and 'overcome it';

- s)  Has a highly conflicted relationship with C.G.H. When he presses her to do something, her initial impulse is to be resistant or reluctant to his demands. He often gets angry with her in circumstances where it is not called for or where she voices objection to something she has been subjected to by others. C.G.H. often uses threats that she will not be able to return to S.T.M. if she does not comply with his demands;
- t) Believes C.G.H. is mean to her, does not understand her and often makes comments about her poor health and her weight which hurt her feelings. She does not feel safe telling C.G.H. about any problems because when she does he often becomes angry acts irrationally and swears. Their interactions are generally much better when C.G.H.'s spouse, T.C., is present and if they are drinking alcohol and are more relaxed. C.G.H.'s spouse, T.C. is often away from Prince George;
- u)  Believes that after she and her friend found the shotgun in C.G.H.'s bedroom he forbade her friend from coming to his home ever since;
- v)  Views C.G.H. as having negative views about S.T.M. and blaming her for the problems they had in their relationship. He does not specifically speak negatively about S.T.M. but implies that she encourages B. to have a negative relationship with him which frustrates her;
- w)  Has generally positive relationships with members of both sides of her extended family. A recent example was time she spent with C.G.H.'s parents who took an active interest in everything she was doing during a recent visit;
- x)  Is unsure whether or not it is realistic but she would like to build a better relationship with C.G.H. but she has long given up trying to win his approval. She feels that his pursuit of more parenting time with her is more about having hours then doing things together; and
- y)  Is very worried that C.G.H. will be upset with her submissions to the Court.
- [401] B.'s request of the Court with regard to parenting arrangements included:
- a)  That she spend more time at S.T.M.'s and less time at C.G.H.'s then is in the present Court Order; and
- b)  That her time with C.G.H. not include overnights but be a number of shorter periods with activities which would allow her to organize and schedule her own activities as she sees fit.

## S.T.M.'s Response

[402] S.T.M.'s response to B.'s views included:

- a)  Practically everything that B. has told her counsel has been expressed to her on numerous occasions and that B. has also expressed similar views to Dr. Ambrose, counsellors and support workers at her school and other friends and family members;
- b)  Although C.G.H. has a number of animals at his home, B. does not feel like she has any say over them but is only told to do chores for the animals which she does alone. In addition, C.G.H. does not keep horses at his home. In contrast the animals at her home are owned by B. and she is responsible for not only their care but other activities which provides her with a lot of joy;
- c)  During B.'s trip to Kelowna with C.G.H. in August 2022, she sent a number of disturbing communications and said she was sad. She did not express any suicidal thoughts at that time but she has expressed similar feelings in the past surrounding time spent with C.G.H. that leaves her emotionally and physically exhausted. She has spoken to Dr. Ambrose about B.'s thoughts of self-harm or suicide. When B. has expressed those thoughts in the past C.G.H. has not taken them seriously but she is very concerned when it happens;
- d)  She does not agree with C.G.H.'s suggestion that B. should consult with a nutritionist because some of her weight issues relate to her medication and her over eating and lack of exercise. She does not believe having yet another specialist would be in B.'s best interests because it will make her feel even more different. She has taken many steps to have B. participate in physical activity but B. does not seem to have the same regime in C.G.H.'s home. In addition, B. reports that at C.G.H.'s home they dine out a lot or eat pre-packaged or prepared foods;
- e)  Although C.G.H. maintains that Dr. Gamache and Dr. Ambrose thought it best for B. not to have sleepovers they occur every time C.G.H. has a parenting time with her. B. spends one night at C.G.H.'s home with a friend and then the next night at the friend's home. C.G.H. has no longer welcomed one of B.'s friends to have sleepovers after that friend's mother testified at the trial;
- f) B. has been dog walking and babysitting for several years and she is very familiar with her clients. She is uncomfortable with strangers and new situations and needs to know the dog or the family before agreeing to take on that work. B. makes her own arrangements for

those activities and then seeks permission for them to occur. They only occur when she is not with C.G.H.;

- g)  B. tells her that C.G.H. is often dismissive of her ASD, telling her that she can overcome it, that she does not need an educational assistant or extra supports. This has resulted in B. being afraid to talk to C.G.H. about her school work; and
- h)  C.G.H. continues to accuse B. of lying, something he has been doing for years. She has encouraged C.G.H. by suggesting ways he could improve his relationship with B. so she does not feel that way but he refuses to make any meaningful changes to his behaviour. After receiving B.'s summary of her views C.G.H. has again tried to prove that those views are not valid.

[403] S.T.M. does not agree with B.'s views regarding a flexible parenting time arrangement with C.G.H. because she requires a clear and consistent planned schedule. Eliminating overnight parenting time would undo much of the progress that is already been made and that B. would simply choose not to have any parenting time with C.G.H. which is not in her best interests.

[404] The present parenting time schedule has been very difficult for B. and should be modified such that C.G.H. would have parenting time and alternate weeks from Thursday until Sunday evening so that B. can return home and be well rested for school on Monday.

## C.G.H.'s Response

[405] C.G.H. filed an affidavit, on which he was cross-examined, attaching 255 pages of photographs of B., texts messages between him and B. and recent correspondence about B.'s weight issues.

[406] His responses to B.'s views included:

- a)  B. was aware months in advance that the summer 2022 vacation would be in Kelowna. The specific dates could not be arranged until the June 2022 Order on parenting time was pronounced. B. has always enjoyed her trips to Kelowna and has asked to go there again

for her birthday. The planning of the Kelowna trip was centred on B.'s wishes and she is often asked if she wants to bring a friend;

- b)  The first he heard of B.'s suicidal thoughts on the vacation was when he read B.'s views. S.T.M. did not bring that concern to his attention. During the holiday B. appeared to enjoy her time with her grandparents and her uncle Tom and was engaged with everyone during the vacation;
- c)  In March 2022, B. requested a birthday trip to Jasper on very short notice. That could not be accommodated but planning, in conjunction with B., allowed for another trip to Kelowna. The trip was organized well in advance but the change of location was made at B.'s request. Another last-minute trip to Kelowna was planned in October 2022 when B. had a Pro - D day and she invited a friend;
- d)  B. made no mention of the circumstances surrounding the departure of D.H. and his children other than to say that only she and S.T.M. lived in that home. B. kept secret the fact that D.H. and his sons had moved out and recently specifically misled her grandfather about the living circumstances in S.T.M.'s home;
- e)  B. also made no mention of a new friend she has recently made who, along with her family, is a refugee from Ukraine living in a renovated area of the [omitted for publication] Office;
- f) Since June 2022, B. has repeatedly watched a movie called 'Hamilton' both alone and with others. There is a scene in the movie where an actor engages in adultery. At that point B. stops watching the movie, become sad and has even said, 'I hate this part of the movie.' She then focuses on watching others in the room for their feedback;
- g)  T.C.'s veterinary practice has routinely taken her away from Prince George since 2018 and that was not raised as an issue for B. until her views were presented to the Court. T.C. works in Kelowna on a halftime basis but she is able to arrange her work schedule there based on the time B. is scheduled to be with them;
- h)  B.'s stress while at his home was discussed in depth in The Report and captured in the opinion that B. absorbs S.T.M.'s anxiety and concerns about him and that she is afraid to be nice to him;
- i) B.'s assertions that he and T.C. do not like listening to her play the piano is grossly incorrect. B. is a good piano player but she has stopped playing the piano in his home because she erroneously believes that she must wear headphones when she is playing. In fact, B. and her friends all play the piano and the only time he has ever asked B. to use headphones was when T.C. was working from home;

- j) B. is only permitted to choose meals like pizza on the two Fridays per month she is in his home. The other dinners are either home-cooked or Costco meal packages and there is always fresh fruit and other healthy snacks for B. to choose from;
- k)  He has never been critical of B.'s school grades. He encourages her in person and in text messages, some of which were attached to the affidavit. B.'s grades have greatly improved in high school in part because she has left the French immersion program and because she now has the necessary resources to address her ASD diagnoses;
- l) When B. is with him, the only organized things she must do are her chores. B. enjoys the various animals that are kept at his residence. After that, she decides what activities she wants to participate in and he tries to accommodate those requests. For the most part B. does her homework at school because she has a block of time each day to work with her IEP assistant. She often tells him, when he asks, that she has no homework but on the occasion when she does have homework he assists her;
- m) B. has separate iPads at S.T.M.'s and his home and, in general, he can identify where B. is based on the iPad address on a text. B. spends a lot of time in her room at his home. She often texts him even though she is in the same house because he is deaf in one ear and the house is large so he might not hear her. In addition, it is her preferred method of communicating with him. When B. Is at his home she still spends considerable time electronically communicating with S.T.M.;
- n)  B. was bullied in gym class so it was arranged that she be excused from that class on the basis that she would participate in her own fitness program. S.T.M. arranged a Zoom workout program for B. three times a week and he tries to encourage her to continue that regime at his home where there is a workout room;
- o)  He has always been supportive of B.'s ASD diagnosis and therapy. He takes B. to her ASD support group regularly and has been educating himself about ASD. He has never told B. that she needs to 'get rid of it' or 'overcome it,' but he does try to teach her skills to manage. B. has many mental health challenges that could be addressed by FST but S.T.M. does not agree to that approach;
- p)  He knows that 'preloading' is of assistance to B. but his understanding from Dr. Ambrose is that it should happen shortly before an event is going to occur rather than months in advance. He offers options to B. to see what she wants to do and she chooses from those options;

- q)  His ability to institute a regime for B. is curtailed by the short periods of time he has with her under the present Court order and longer periods with less frequent exchanges would assist in instituting routine;
- r) He is not unnecessarily mean to B. nor is he ever harsh or critical of her. He has never expressed specific comments about B.'s weight but has spoken to her about her health and diet. He is also communicated with S.T.M. about getting assistance for B's obesity by consulting a nutritionist but S.T.M. did not reply. In consultation with Dr. Ambrose and Dr. Gamache he has presented healthy food choices to B. and how such choices might make her feel;
- s)  B. does dog walking and babysitting at S.T.M.'s home. He has only refused to permit B. to dog sit on one occasion when, without advance notice, B. wanted to have a strange dog in their home where they already have six dogs, two of which are health compromised. Not knowing that dog's health status or temperament he did not permit it. On one occasion, B. wanted to babysit at a home but she could not provide him with the persons' names, their address or telephone number. Without that basic information, he did not feel it was safe for B. He does not think it reasonable that he should have to drive B. from his home to the area of the city where S.T.M. lives to babysit for S.T.M.'s friends;
- t) He and T.C. have made many attempts to encourage B. to become involved in babysitting or dog walking in his neighbourhood. They have also approached a dog kennel close by who would have part time work for B. but she declined. She has become less engaged in any activity she enjoyed since the trial started in April 2021;
- u)  B. gets along with other people who she knows, such as extended family and her friend group, but she is shy when it comes to meeting new people;
- v)  He does not speak negatively about S.T.M. because he does not speak of how he feels about S.T.M. at all but he does tell her the truth and complies with the August 2020 Order about such matters;
- w)  T.C. contacted S.T.M.'s former spouse's family because S.T.M. had told him that her previous spouse had mistreated her and she was now making similar accusations against him. He wanted to see what that family's side of the story was. T.C. prepared and sent the email without any input from him;
- x)  He and T.C. are considering writing a book how parental alienation hurts both the alienated parent and the child once B. becomes an adult; and

- y)  He has never missed a time or date to return B. and does not threaten her about that. On some occasions, he reminds B. that she has chores to do before she leaves his home and she complies.

## SUBMISSIONS

[407] C.G.H.'s counsel provided 184 pages of written submissions, subsequent written submissions on issues raised after the trial and oral submissions.

- [409] B.'s counsel made oral submissions in support of her views.
- [410] The many sections of the FLA and CSG and numerous case authorities referred to by counsel and the Court are set out in Appendix B.
- [411] I reviewed and considered all the written and oral submissions but have greatly condensed and summarized them here.

- [412] Faryna, Bradshaw, Franklin and Re: Novac discuss the tests the Court must apply in assessing the credibility of a witness. The Court should find that C.G.H. was a credible witness and S.T.M. was not.
- [413] S.T.M. acknowledged that [omitted for publication] are impressed with the public's trust with higher standards of truthfulness in both affidavits and oral evidence and that she must not exaggerate, embellish or give evidence that is in any way misleading. Despite that, she either overstated or understated facts. She exaggerated, speculated and was vague, inconsistent, a careless historian and, at times, a dishonest and campaigning witness.

[414] S.T.M.'s evidence should be viewed with caution unless other reliable evidence corroborates it. She failed to provide documents or records to prove or disprove her claims, mostly relying on her own account, and the hearsay evidence of B., which must be considered in the context of parental alienation.

[415] Some examples of S.T.M.'s unbelievable evidence are:

- a)  She always wanted to move to an equal parenting schedule, but B. was just not ready;
- b)  Disclosing her relationship with D.H. and why B. was comfortable with him but not her own father;
- c)  Being 'extorted' to sign the Agreement by C.G.H. even though she sent an email to family members describing him as a kind man who was not a threat to anyone and acknowledging that she was aware of community resources assistance if she felt threatened;
- d)  She was a 'single parent' during early years of B.'s life;
- e)  Her timeline about the day of the Shotgun Incident;
- f) The change of transitions, and not the imposition of a police enforcement clause, after the August 2020 Order resulted in zero missed parenting time;
- g)  That B.'s high-functioning ASD is causing her to not want to have parenting time with C.G.H.;
- h)  The details of her telephone call with, and complaint about SW Wiebe at the time of B.'s complaint to the MCFD and RCMP which was contradicted by Ms. Wiebe;
- i) Her insistence that she does not let B. choose but she supports B.'s mental and emotional well-being and does not disregard when B. makes a 'choice' whether she should go to C.G.H.'s home for scheduled parenting time; and
- j) Her allegations of his aggressive demeanour.

[416] S.T.M.'s credibility must also be considered in relation to her complaint about Dr. Aube. Dr. Aube was a fair and impartial expert witness. She had no motive to be biased in The Report. S.T.M. disagreed with Dr. Aube's conclusions and she and her parents filed false complaints with the College solely for the purpose of discrediting The Report so the Court had no independent expert evidence about alienation.

[417] As a [omitted for publication] S.T.M., was well aware of her duty to strictly obey court orders and promote respect for the judicial system. She breached numerous court orders and has displayed no remorse for breaching her obligations as a litigant, and as a peace officer, who is obligated to uphold the rule of law and to encourage respect for the court system. S.T.M.'s behaviour raises serious credibility issues regarding her past and future actions and testimony as a [omitted for publication].

## S.T.M.

[418] The law places a higher standard on [omitted for publication] in their private lives and in Court. S.T.M.'s evidence conformed to her oath but her role as a mother is very different from her role as an [omitted for publication] and her evidence should be considered like other mothers giving evidence in a family proceeding.

[419] S.T.M. gave honest, sincere testimony to the best of her ability and was not untruthful, or inconsistent in her evidence. She had good recall and gave context and detail when asked. C.G.H. mischaracterized and ignored her evidence on several points in order to paint her as inconsistent.

[420] She did the lion's share of B.'s caregiving. C.G.H.'s evidence showed him caring for B. but instances were rare. She did not say that C.G.H. never participated in any of these activities.

[421] S.T.M. only hears negative things from B. about B.'s time with C.G.H. Dr. Ambrose and Ms. Paxton said that it is not unusual for people with ASD to fixate on the negative. C.G.H. disagrees that B. only has negative experiences with him, but that is B.'s reality.

[422] Without evidence, C.G.H. blames many things on her including the CPIC entry and various appointment mix-ups.

[423] C.G.H.'s testimony was evasive and non-responsive. He often avoided the questions asked and repeated answers, to suit his narrative, even when presented with electronic communications that contradicted his testimony. In the event of a conflict in the evidence, S.T.M.'s evidence should be preferred.

## The Chicken Coop Incident

## C.G.H.

[424] In the summer of 2016, B. seemed to be anxious. The Chicken Coop Incident occurred after C.G.H. warned B. that the chickens and the dogs must be separated or the dogs would attack the chickens. B. left a door open that allowed the dogs access to the chicken coop but he intervened just in time. That was the only time he yelled at B. It was not, and is not his practice to yell at her. He immediately regretted the incident and attempted to resolve it with her.

[425] B's anxiety manifested and amplified around the same time that D.H. moved into S.T.M.'s home. He was unaware of the move until two and a half years later when Dr. Ambrose inadvertently mentioned it. B. never mentioned that D.H.'s two boys spent every other week living there after spring of 2018. S.T.M. said that she had told him about D.H. and his sons living with her since 2016 but at trial admitted that she 'never even thought about it' as to why it was left to B. to bring up. S.T.M. told B. not to tell and told him not to question B. about her home.

## S.T.M.

[426] Prior to the Chicken Coop incident C.G.H. discounted her concerns about B.'s anxieties, often making fun of her. He also refused to cooperate with her to try to address them. C.G.H. did not speak to B. about the incident.

[427] She denies being untruthful or concealing her relationship with D.H. from C.G.H. because she corresponded with him numerous times on that topic. C.G.H. had no

reaction when Dr. Ambrose told him about D.H. and it was not until several days later that he feigned surprise in support of his false narrative of B.'s alienation from him.

## Parental Alienation

## C.G.H.

[428] C.G.H. was troubled with S.T.M.'s co-sleeping with B. because it was both dangerous and inappropriate for an adult to sleep with an infant. S.T.M. disagreed and continued the practice for many years. She also continued to assist B. with her toileting until she was 9 or 10 years old. He objected to that practice and said that B. was old enough to maintain herself.

- [429] S.T.M. breastfed B. until she was almost two years old and would hold B. for extended periods and not put her down. He thought it both excessive and unhealthy for B.'s development.
- [430] In Williamson , the Court described parental alienation, at paragraphs 39 to 41, as a term used in the context of divorce and separation cases to describe a breakdown in the relationship between a child and one of the separated parents:
- [39] … Some courts have said that alienation can occur as an unfortunate side-effect of the breakdown of a relationship, but can also occur because of deliberate actions, both direct and indirect, on the part of the parent: GL v GR , 2012 BCSC 1365 at paras 1-2.
- [40] In WDS v WDA , 2012 BCSC 1522, Mr. Justice Barrow thoroughly discussed some of the concepts relating to parental alienation. At para 64, Barrow J stated that at the core of parental alienation is:
5. … the notion that the child's decision to refuse to have a relationship with the targeted parent without justification or without convincing reason. If there is a reason given by the child for taking the extreme step of refusing to have a relationship with a parent, it will often be out of all proportion to

the decision taken. The reasons for such decisions need to be assess with the particular personality and experience of the child involved. What may seem a thin or unconvincing rationale for one child may have a much more convincing force in the context of the personality and experience of another child.

[41] If a court finds a parent 'guilty' of alienation, that finding does not pre-determine one particular remedy: GL at para 220. Determining an appropriate response once a finding of alienation is made is an extremely important process since it can have an impact on both the short and long-term well-being of the children involved. GN, at para 287.

[431] In The Report Dr. Aube concluded, 'there are signs of parental alienation, even though it may have been initially unintentional and at times subtle, there is evidence that B. was harmed in the process.' At trial, Dr. Aube said that initially the alienation may have not been purposeful, but as soon as it became apparent that C.G.H. wanted more involvement in B.'s life, the alienation became intentional.

[432] S.T.M. relies on Dr. Ambrose not finding there was alienation. Dr. Ambrose is not an expert on alienation and unlike Dr. Aube, she is a clinical psychologist not a forensic psychologist and it is not her job to verify what she was told by S.T.M. Dr. Ambrose's response at trial that there was not alienation does not preclude the Court from finding that there was alienating behaviours exhibited by S.T.M. and B.

[433] Dr. Aube became aware of B.'s ASD diagnosis after The Report was delivered. She is familiar with ASD and Asperger's Syndrome and said that B. might have ASD, but she also suffers from alienation. They are not mutually exclusive and she would not change the parenting recommendations expressed in The Report.

[434] There was no independent expert evidence linking B.'s repetitive behaviours to ASD, other than S.T.M.'s own subjective opinion evidence and some hearsay anecdotal

evidence from Ms. Paxton, who was not qualified as an expert in ASD, and has never met or assessed B.

[435] L.G. outlined 11 characteristics of Parental Alienation Syndrome (PAS) focused on the alienating parent's behaviour. Most of these characteristics are present in B. A PAS diagnosis is based on the level of symptoms in the child, not the alienating parent. B.'s behaviours and not S.T.M.'s are important for a finding of alienation.

[436] A child's PAS characteristics and parental alienation are powerful psychosocial forces that lead the child to develop comorbid emotional problems, troublesome and often deviant behaviours, and impaired interpersonal relationships.

[437] The Report set out the criteria used to make a finding of alienation including four major factors that are relevant to ascertain whether alienation is the primary cause of a child's rejection of one parent and alignment with the other. The Report did not indicate any evidence that C.G.H. and B. had an inadequate relationship prior to B. refusing to have parenting time with him, consistent with other evidence.

[438] S.T.M.'s position is that C.G.H. was an absentee parent, and she was a single parent and he had little early involvement in parenting B. Dr. Aube said that estrangement is when a parent and a child see less and less of one another, and the child realizes that they do not have much in common. In this case, alienation and not estrangement is present. B. was especially susceptible to S.T.M.'s alienation from C.G.H. because of the early days of enmeshment between them and B.'s ASD diagnosis.

[439] In N.R.G. the Court discussed the distinct differences between the concepts of estrangement and alienation in paragraphs 276 -278:

[276] In  high-conflict  separations,  both  parents  commonly attempt to undermine the children's relationship with the other parent.  Occasionally,  children  reject  one  of  the  parents, resisting or even refusing contact. It is in such contexts that

the  concepts  of  'estrangement'  and  'alienation'  are  often invoked.

[277] The  difference  between  an  estranged  child  and  an alienated  child  lies  in  the  cause;  estrangement,  sometimes referred  to  as  'realistic  estrangement',  is  the  label  applied when the child understandably refuses contact with a parent because the of the latter's behaviour whether it be physical or emotional abuse, rigid or restrictive parenting, immature and self-centered behaviour, and/or dysfunctional conduct arising from the parent's own psychological or psychiatric issues. In such circumstances, the child's rejection of the parent may well be a reasonable and adaptive response to the estranged parent's behaviour.

[278] An  alienated  child,  on  the  other  hand,  is  the  label frequently  applied  when  there  is  little or no  objectively reasonable cause for the child's rejection of the parent and particularly when it is the product of the other parent's hostility and antipathy towards his/her former spouse and the intentional undermining by the former of the child's relationship  with  the  latter.  While  the  undermining  of  the relationship can arise from direct or indirect behaviour, in its worst  form  the  parental  conduct  is  expressly  designed  to alienate  the  child  from  the  other  parent.  Such  conduct  is pernicious and unpardonable.

[Emphasis Added]

[440] Applying the legal concept of alienation versus estrangement from N.R.G. , B. is clearly alienated rather than estranged. Her responses to C.G.H. are not reasonable or adaptive. In The Report, Dr. Aube wrote that, 'the rationale, used by B. for rejecting her dad, is rather meek.'

[441] Dr. Ambrose commented on B.'s rejection of C.G.H. saying she did not know the reasons behind it but gave examples of B. reporting things that were quite trivial. S.T.M. said 'the things [B.] comes up with are just so ludicrous'. S.T.M. also said that on some occasions, the things that B. says might not be based on a reality other than her own. She described it as possibly being 'bridge burning' related to B.'s ASD.

[442] There is no rational or understandable reason for B. to reject C.G.H. The RCMP and MCFD investigations revealed no inappropriate behaviour by him. The Report said there is no evidence that he has been abusive to B. S.T.M. did not allege any form of verbal, emotional, physical and/or sexual abuse by him towards B.

[443] The Report discussed the Favoured Parent (S.T.M.) engaging in behaviours consistent with alienation including;

- a)  Limiting contact: S.T.M. 'stonewalling' C.G.H.'s requests for more parenting time, and S.T.M.'s response that she tried to accommodate his work schedule;
- b)  Polarization: B. expressed how demanding it was for her to make the decision to choose if she is going to C.G.H.'s home or not;
- c)  Withholding information: This happens when one parent deprives the other parent of opportunities to function as a parent and creating the impression that he or she does not care enough. An example was B. being prescribed OCD medication and events surrounding that doctor's visit;
- d)  Confiding in child: B. reported that S.T.M. talks about court with her, and told her that the Court would let her decide where she wanted to live;
- e)  Asking to keep secrets: B.'s not telling C.G.H. about her stepfamily; and
- f) Interference with parenting time: the main message to B. has to be that her time must be seen as a priority.

[444] In G.N.R. , the Court noted that in alienation there is 'intentional undermining by the former of the child's relationship with the latter … undermining of the relationship can arise from direct or indirect behaviour'. Dr. Aube testified that alienation starts very subtly, by wondering if the child is safe, asking questions, giving the child subtle messages, telling them they will be missed. An example was B. being afraid that her mom would die of a broken heart or telling her mom that she was afraid. S.T.M. used subtle manipulation of B., for many years masking her actions in B.'s various health syndromes in a successful campaign of alienation.

[445] In C.L.M., the Court held that Dr. Aube's opinion, in that case, was fully supported by the evidence adduced that 'clearly establishes that … the claimant consistently engaged in behaviours that slowly alienated the children from the respondent … I am satisfied that lay and expert evidence prove that'. The Court then discussed behaviours similar to the Favoured Parent described by Dr. Aube. Further, in paragraphs 388 and 398, the Court stated:

[388] In light of the foregoing, it is no surprise that the Child gradually became more confused and anxious about parenting time with the respondent … the evidence fully supports Dr. Aube's opinion that the claimant has given the child explicit and implicit messages that have undermined the child's relationship with the father. This polarization created a high level of stress and anxiety for the Child. The Child's conduct around transition times, including leaving school grounds to avoid his father's pick-up times and his extreme emotional behaviours, speak volumes as to the forces at play.

[389] I find that the claimant's conduct as outlined above constitutes emotional or psychological abuse of the respondent and the child. It is a pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour directed at the respondent, the child … which has harmed the Child's psychological and emotional safety, security, and well-being.' [Emphasis Added].

[446] There has been considerable PAS of B. by S.T.M. and her actions amount to family violence.

[447] In N.R.G., the Court described some of the legal responses to alienation including court-ordered therapeutic intervention, supervised parenting and transferring guardianship from the alienating parent. C.G.H. was seeking an order that the Parties and B. attend FST and move to an immediate equal parenting regime. That was amended to seek orders granting him full parental responsibilities and for the Court to consider remedies similar to M.S.R .

[448] S.T.M. denied interfering with C.G.H.'s time or discouraging B. from seeing him but she made it evident to B. that it was 'up to her' to decide. S.T.M. expressed that view in several emails in 2019. It became clear that S.T.M. groomed B. and B. embraced the idea that she should be reluctant to spend time with him even though she obviously enjoyed her time with him and T.C. once she was at their home. Her resistance was the direct result of S.T.M.'s influence. That is supported by the findings in The Report. S.T.M. had authority over B. as almost no parenting time was missed after the imposition of the police enforcement clause.

[449] S.T.M.'s conduct also undermined C.G.H.'s time with B. by stressing how much she missed B. when she was at his home, and by sending a barrage of electronic communications when she was there.

[450] There was also no evidence that B's high-functioning ASD is the root cause for her behaviour towards C.G.H., and only him. Dr. Aube did not attribute this behaviour to ASD, and there is no other expert evidence that does.

[451] C.G.H. should receive compensatory parenting time. This will allow him to have the time he should have had with B., but also to improve the strong bond that already exists between them. Given B.'s age, there is very little time to repair the harm that has been caused by S.T.M.'s alienating conduct. B. must be given the message that both of her parents are important, and that message to her must be conveyed immediately.

## S.T.M.

[452] S.T.M. denies she attempted to alienate B. from C.G.H. B.'s reluctance comes from a combination of many factors including:

- a)  Her ASD and other disorders;
- b)  C.G.H.'s refusal to fully accept B.'s OCD and ASD diagnoses and his interactions with her that ignore or minimize her circumstances; and
- c)  Her estrangement from C.G.H. due to his absences for many years.

[453] B.'s ASD diagnosis was a light bulb moment for S.T.M. because it provided answers for many of B.'s different struggles. She is now better equipped with the knowledge and resources available to help B. Viewing B.'s struggles through the ASD lens has helped her better understand B.'s specific challenges.

## Section 37 Analysis

## (a) the child's health and emotional well-being;

## C.G.H.

[454] C.G.H.'s focus is the best interests of B. He continues to participate in Dr. Ambrose's therapy with B. He actively endorsed The Report and its recommendations. He organized B.'s psychoeducational assessment as recommended by The Report.

[455] He is concerned about the emotional and psychological damage done to B. by the enmeshment and parental alienation diagnosed by Dr. Aube but denied by S.T.M. Despite years of therapy B.'s trivial complaints about him persist.

[456] He has followed the objectives and recommendations of the Court, and the medical professionals to improve his relationship with B. while S.T.M. remains resistant to any suggestion that would bolster his relationship with B.

[457] Dr. Gamache has seen significant improvement with him and T.C. in their parenting of B. He is making efforts to be the best parent for B. but S.T.M. does not recognize those efforts and continues to prohibit him from exercising these improvements through continued parental alienation.

[458] He has requested a parenting coordinator multiple times but S.T.M. has refused this request.

## S.T.M.

[459] B.'s unique health and emotional needs make it particularly important to take into account her diagnoses when assessing what is in her best interests.  It is also important to assess how to best support B.in dealing with, and overcoming, those challenges . B.'s mental and physical health and emotional well-being are connected.  B.'s anxieties often manifest in physical symptoms.  She becomes ill, cannot sleep, and has migraines.

[460] C.G.H. has completely ignored, or discounted, B.'s health and emotional wellbeing.  He blames S.T.M. for every one of B.'s struggles.  He has not participated in obtaining any additional supports for B.  He has not supported B.'s therapies or her medications that are both clearly beneficial, and has denied that she has OCD, or ASD.

[461] C.G.H. says that B.'s anxieties are a reflection of S.T.M.'s anxieties  despite the fact that she has never been diagnosed with any anxiety issues.  C.G.H.'s denials makes him completely incapable of assisting B. When S.T.M. tries to communicate with him about B.'s issues, he ignores her.

[462] The professionals' evidence substantiates that it would be completely detrimental to B.'s health and emotional well-being to uproot her from S.T.M.'s home and implement the dramatic change that C.G.H. seeks.  C.G.H. has consistently insisted on implementation of an equal parenting regime, and later sole parenting time to him, without considering the impact that such a schedule would have on B.

[463] In order to protect B.'s health and emotional well-being, the Court should order a schedule that increases parenting time only when doing so will not result in further harm to B.'s mental and physical health.

## (b) the child's views, unless it would be inappropriate to consider them; C.G.H.

[464] B.'s views should be heard, but not considered because they are not her own. They result from parental alienation and the enmeshed relationship between her and S.T.M.

[465] B. does not have the cognitive maturity to make the decision to which Party she should go to for parenting time. S.T.M. first said that B. was six months to one year behind others of her age, while later maintaining that B. has recently matured. The Report says B. does not want to make the decision and S.T.M. is harming B. by assigning such a daunting and serious task to her.

[466] S.T.M. maintains that B. 'is not ready' for a shared parenting regime. B. mirrors S.T.M.'s views and it is not B. but rather S.T.M. who is not ready for shared parenting.

[467] In C.J.J. , the Court found that the parties' 16-year-old son had been alienated from his mother. It was in his best interests to order him, and family members, to attend a reunification program. At paragraph 409, the Court held:

[409]   By reason of s. 37(2)(b) of the FLA , I am duty-bound to consider X's views, 'unless it would be inappropriate to do so'. I have no hesitation in saying that in the ordinary case of a recalcitrant teenager the views of the child might well carry considerable weight. This is not the situation here. While I do not consider it 'inappropriate' to consider X's views, it will be apparent from my reasons that I consider his views to be, in large part, the product of alienation and the associated enmeshment with his father and his father's views. I am satisfied that X's views are based on a distorted view of past events.

## S.T.M.

[468] B. is almost 15 years old and has clearly expressed her views in her diary and to other people.  There is no shortage of other evidence of her views, including from the Parties', Dr. Ambrose, who has worked with B. for several years, The Report and Dr. Aube, the evidence of other witnesses, and her interview with Sgt. Collins. Most important are the views that she has expressed through Mr. Petrisor. Given her age, it is imperative that her views receive consideration.

[469] The undeniable theme is B.'s very strong preference is to spend less time with C.G.H. where she feels unsafe, is not allowed to be herself, is not listened to or believed and suffers greater anxiety. B. wants to spend more time with S.T.M. where she feels safe, supported and loved.

[470] B. has also demonstrated what she wants.  She has taken the bus to S.T.M.'s home on more than one occasion during C.G.H.'s parenting time.  She has threatened to run away.  She has threatened to harm herself, and has acted on that on one occasion (although the incident did not cause Dr. Ambrose concern). She has expressed suicidal thoughts.  She has fought, kicked and screamed to try to keep from having to go to C.G.H.'s home.  She also has physical symptoms including vomiting when she has to spend time with C.G.H.

[471] The Court in T.T. noted that it was a well-established principle that the Court should give considerable weight to the views of an older child, proportionate to their age and level of maturity and that for custody orders relating to children in their teens to be practical they must reasonably conform to the wishes of the child. As B. gets older, her views become even more important to consider.

[472] T.T. noted that Section 37 (3) of the FLA directs that an order is not in the best interests of a child unless it protects, to the greatest extent possible, the child's physical, psychological and emotional safety, security and well-being.

## (c) the nature and strength of the relationships between the child and significant persons in the child's life;

## C.G.H.

[473] C.G.H. disputes that prior to the separation S.T.M. assumed almost all the work and responsibility for B. He helped S.T.M. during her pregnancy and was involved in B.'s early care as a happy and engaged father. This included reducing his work schedule after B. was born.

[474] C.G.H. was, and is, a loving and caring father, who made a significant contribution to the family, both emotionally and financially. He is involved in all aspects of B.'s medical care and education. He formed a strong early bond with B. S.T.M. undermined that relationship by her post separation conduct.

[475] C.G.H. continues to endorse visits between B. and both sides of her extended family and he encourages her to speak freely about her family and feelings.

## S.T.M.

[476] S.T.M. is B.'s primary attachment. Dr. Ambrose and B. have indicated that her secondary attachment, or 'safe place', is her maternal grandparents in Burns Lake. She had a strong relationship with her stepfather, and her two step- siblings. She also has a strong bond with her maternal aunt, and her family.

[477] Dr. Aube said that it would be 'devastating' for B. if C.G.H. received sole custody and guardianship. The most important person in B.'s life is S.T.M. and even small changes to the care arrangements that affect B.'s time with her would have a significant impact on B.'s mental health.

[478] The amount of electronic communication S.T.M. and B. have when B. is with C.G.H. highlights the importance of the bond between them. There are many examples of B. sending numerous communications to S.T.M. in a short period of time and if there

was no response, B. would spiral and continue to communicate until S.T.M. answers. This often happened in the middle of the night when B. cannot sleep.

[479] S.T.M. has worked closely with Dr. Ambrose to limit the communications in a way that is healthy for B. There has been significant progress but B. has a strong need to have regular contact with her.

[480] C.G.H. is unable to communicate with B. He does not ask her why she is feeling the way she is feeling towards him, address the fears and anxieties she has or speak to her about her historical complaints. B. does not feel comfortable enough to share these things with him.

[481] C.G.H. must stop blaming S.T.M. and actually start implementing the things that the professionals and S.T.M. have proven to be beneficial for B. C.G.H. needs to work to improve the nature and strength of his relationship with B. Until that happens and B. is comfortable with him, there should be no changes to increase his parenting time.

## (d) the history of the child's care;

## C.G.H.

[482] C.G.H. had a solid relationship with B. and was heavily involved in her childhood prior to separation. Dr. Gamache said that previous history does not always determine the relationship between a parent and child. Relationships may be mended or improved through positive encouragement by the mother.

## S.T.M.

[483] S.T.M. has been B.'s primary caregiver for her entire life. B.'s primary residence has been with S.T.M. since the separation. B. attends high school within the catchment area of S.T.M.'s home. A change to B.'s primary residence to C.G.H.'s home would require a change of schools.

[484] On almost all of C.G.H.'s parenting times B. has a friend come to sleep over one night and then goes to the friend's home for another night. When C.G.H. has B. in his care for several nights, his actual time with her is limited. B. only insists on sleepovers when she is in C.G.H.'s care, finding ways to entertain herself and avoid spending time with C.G.H. B. struggles significantly whenever she has long blocks of time with C.G.H. That favours not increasing his the parenting time at this point.

## (e) the child's need for stability, given the child's age and stage of development; C.G.H.

[485] Dr. Aube wrote, 'C.G.H. is unmistakably the hallmark of a caring loving father and it is her opinion that B. should not be deprived of having a regular, fulfilling relationship with C.G.H.' He and T.C. have accessed therapies that will be helpful to B. including the Unicorn Club, Dr. Gamache and FST.

## S.T.M.

[486] As a child with anxieties; OCD and ASD, B.'s particular needs and her stage of development makes this factor very important. The evidence is clear she needs stability, consistency and routine.

[487] Ms. Paxton, Dr. Ambrose and Dr. Aube highlighted the importance of 'preloading' B. with information beforehand on what she is going to be doing or expect to occur in her day. B. does not do well with surprises and S.T.M. has asked C.G.H. on several occasions to explain to B. what she can expect during his parenting time. C.G.H. refuses to provide this information to B. and does not see the need to pre-load her.

[488] B.'s most stable and consistent environment is with S.T.M. Any change, even small ones, can have a serious negative impact on her. Dramatic changes to the parenting arrangements will an equally dramatic negative impact.

- (f)  the ability of each person who is a guardian or seeks guardianship of the child, or who has or seeks parental responsibilities, parenting time or contact with the child, to exercise his or her responsibilities;

## C.G.H.

[489] C.G.H. has consistently exercised his parental responsibilities to B. He has researched numerous sources for support on children with ASD and worked to apply these skills to his relationship with her. He has learned about the issues of parental alienation and ways to improve his relationship with B.

## S.T.M.

[490] C.G.H. did not reliably exercise his parenting time in the past as shown by the numerous times that he changed the schedule in the early years after separation.

[491] The Court should have no confidence that he is able to exercise parental responsibilities. C.G.H. missed most of B.'s school functions for the majority of her elementary school. He did not attend parent teacher interviews. He did not assist with retaining professionals to help B. He did not register her in any extra-curricular activities, aside from horseback riding. He does not help her arrange for babysitting, dog walking or fundraising. He is virtually unaware of what is going on in B.'s life. The only thing that C.G.H. has shown he is willing to do with respect to B. is have her in his home.

[492] There is nothing preventing C.G.H. from getting any information about B. that he would like directly from the school. He has the same access to the information as S.T.M. does but blames her whenever he is unaware of something that is within his responsibility as a parent to know.

[493] If C.G.H. is given the decision making power over B. there is no evidence that he will be able to properly exercise his responsibilities. S.T.M. on the other hand, has proven that she is an actively involved parent and regularly advocates for B.'s needs.

[494] After B.'s disclosure to her school counsellor, C.G.H. amended his Reply claiming sole guardianship and sole parenting time despite all the evidence that such a change would be devastating for B.

[495] C.G.H.'s and T.C.'s actions in presenting false evidence about S.T.M.'s relationship with J.L. and attempting to obtain information about S.T.M.'s past history from her previous deceased spouse's family is nothing more than an attempt to dig up dirt to gain an advantage and demonstrates a lack of ability to appropriately exercise parental responsibilities.

- (g) the impact of any family violence on the child's safety, security or well-being, whether  the  family  violence  is  directed  toward  the  child  or  another  family member;

## C.G.H.

[496] The Court must consider the impact of family violence on B. The definition of 'family violence' is broad and includes 'psychological and emotional abuse'. Dr. Aube said that alienation is a form of emotional abuse and has long-term consequences.

[497] In C.J.J., the Court found that alienation is a form of psychological abuse and was family violence. Whether inadvertently or not, S.T.M. has engaged in family violence against B. In C.J.J., the Court ordered that the family attend reunification therapy.

## S.T.M.

[498] S.T.M. is not alleging any family violence by C.G.H. She denies that she has committed family violence against B.

[499] B. repeated dated allegations of inappropriate actions by C.G.H. That is not family violence but is a concern for B. that has festered for years.

[500] C.G.H. has reported S.T.M. to the MCFD. He did that soon after S.T.M. filed an Application in order to gain an advantage in the litigation.

- (h) whether the actions of a person responsible for family violence indicate that the person may be impaired in his or her ability to care for the child and meet the child's needs;

C.G.H.

[501] No submission

## S.T.M.

[502] This only applies as it relates to B.'s perception that C.G.H. wronged her in the past. By failing to deal with these issues, his inability to see B.'s perspective and address those concerns C.G.H. is impaired in his ability to care for her and meet her needs.

- (i)  the appropriateness of an arrangement that would require the child's guardians to  cooperate  on  issues  affecting  the  child,  including  whether  requiring cooperation would increase any risks to the safety, security or well-being of the child or other family members;

## C.G.H.

[503] Both Parties said they wish for equal parenting time with B. but only C.G.H. has shown a true intention and action to reach this target. Despite the recommendations of medical professionals and The Report, S.T.M. has continuously failed to provide him with equal parenting time further fracturing his relationship with B.

[504] S.T.M. maintains that B.'s ASD has been a primary component for her delaying equal parenting time but that the current parenting schedule is 'close to 50/50 actually.'

She wants to speak to an ASD specialist and get their help to get them 'to that point' and the transition to equal parenting time needs to be slow.

[505] S.T.M. maintained that B. needs pre-loading and consistency in her day to day life but it is clear 'preloading' only applies to scenario's that S.T.M. sees fit and convenient. She has exploited B.'s ASD diagnosis to suit a narrative that prevents C.G.H. from having equal parenting time.

## S.T.M.

[506] S.T.M. repeatedly tried to communicate with C.G.H. about concerns and issues that have arisen regarding B. C.G.H., for the most part, has ignored her communications.

[507] It is in B.'s best interest that the Parties communicate. That has not occurred in the past and is not currently happening. The Parties should be required to communicate on matters affecting B. but be prohibited from blaming, criticizing, or disparaging each other either to B. or to each other.

- (j) any civil or criminal proceeding relevant to the child's safety, security or wellbeing .

## C.G.H.

[508] No submissions

## S.T.M.

[509] There are no ongoing civil or criminal proceedings relevant to B.'s safety, security or well-being.  Although the Shotgun Incident showed C.G.H.'s illegal and unsafe firearm storage, it was S.T.M.'s view that no further action was needed and she did not report the incident to the RCMP.  C.G.H. now keeps guns safely locked away in accordance with the law.

## Parenting Time

## C.G.H.

[510] C.G.H.'s position on parenting time changed between the end of the trial and the final submissions after B. became involved in the litigation.

## Initial Position

[511] The most important issue is the prospective parenting regime of B. S.T.M. has for years stated that she is in favour of an equal parenting regime, but she has resisted its implementation saying B. is still not ready. This, notwithstanding the fact that B. is 15 years old and that when she is able to spend time with C.G.H. and T.C. at their home, she is happy, enjoys her visits and loves the animals there.

- [512] S.T.M. submits that equal parenting time should be implemented only if and when recommended by Ms. Paxton. There is no evidence that Ms. Paxton is qualified or willing to make final parenting decision-making, or is able to ascertain B.'s best interests.
- [513] The Court should order an equal time parenting regime and that B.'s primary residence be with C.G.H. The Parties should share all parenting decisions respecting B.'s education, health, and other related issues and in the event of a disagreement on any issue, C.G.H. should have final decision-making power as recommended by Dr. Aube. B. deserves closure and a loving relationship with C.G.H.
- [514] In Young, the significance of the maximum contact principle in the under the Divorce Act was emphasised in the statements:

'the court shall give effect 'to the principle that a child of the marriage should have as much contact with each spouse as is consistent with the best interests of the child.' and later 'The modifying phrase 'as is consistent with the best interests of the child' means that the goal of maximum contact of each parent with the child is not absolute. To the

extent that contact conflicts with the best interests of the child, it may be restricted. But only to that extent.'

[515] Although maximum contact is not absolute, it is in B.'s best interests to have maximum contact with C.G.H. to facilitate a stronger relationship to counter the parental alienation of S.T.M. Several professionals have advocated for an increase in his parenting time with B. and S.T.M. has provided no compelling evidence to dispel the notion that he is not fit to have equal parenting time.

[516] His limited parenting time until now should not be considered to be the status quo nor should it continue moving forward. As described in H , the current parenting schedule should not remain the status quo because it does not reflect B.'s best interests.

[517] In J.A.M.P. , the Court ruled that equal parenting time is not necessarily in the best interests of the child if the circumstances do not call for it. There needs to be a focus on the Parties' right or entitlement to parenting time as well but there are no presumptions in the proper allocation of parenting time.

[518] C.G.H.'s primary goal is B.'s best interests. He has acted on the extensive evaluations in The Report and other medical guidance to improve his relationship with B. and to ensure that increasing his parenting time is the appropriate measure for her. S.T.M. position that the present circumstances do not call for a change in parenting time is contrary to the advice of medical professionals that should take precedence.

[519] It is critical to B.'s well-being that she move easily between the Parties respective homes. The history of stress she has experienced has caused her emotional and psychological harm and resulted in poor progress in school. The stable, structured, and calm atmosphere of C.G.H.'s home will be of considerable assistance to B., will assist to reduce her stress and psychological issues, will, improve her school performance and offer her a haven. Through an equal parenting regime, C.G.H. can apply the maximum

contact principle and continue to be a strong role model in B.'s life. Such a change in the parenting schedule will require S.T.M.'s compliance and police enforcement.

[520] It is imperative that each of the Parties be able to set standards, expectations and instil core values in B. There are big parenting approaches between the two households. S.T.M. said that she and C.G.H. have polar opposite views on how to raise B. He is unable to set any limits on B.'s behaviour based on her complaints to S.T.M. and her false disclosures.

[521] B. could benefit from more discipline, and the evidence shows that B. has not been getting enough discipline from S.T.M. Some parents comfort a child too much, or not enough. S.T.M. legitimizes B.'s unrealistic concerns about her safety but says that B.'s concerns are not rooted in anyone else's reality but her own.

[522] B. should spend more time in C.G.H.'s home to get a better grasp on reality. She is 15 years old, and there is very little time to assist her and reshape her views to understand authority and to be able to function within the structure of society. S.T.M.'s constant shielding of B. is contrary to her best interests.

[523] It is essential that the Court appoint a parenting coordinator to assist the Parties in resolving any issues that may arise while exercising their parenting responsibilities. The Court should order the Parties and B., to engage and participate in FST to assist them in smoothing out any remaining issues and to assist in making the transitions from one home to the other comfortable and stress-free for B.

## Later Position

[524] The Court should grant C.G.H. all of the parental responsibilities and final decision-making authority over B. until she reaches 19. The Court should also grant him all of the parenting time for a period determined by the Court and the reunification experts, as ordered in M.S.R .; with alternate weekends to S.T.M.

[525] In M.S.R., the Court found that parental alienation constituted psychological abuse and is a form of family violence. The Court should grant a Protection Order against S.T.M. in favour of C.G.H. and B.

## S.T.M.

[526] Since separation, S.T.M. has maintained that she would like to arrive at an equal shared parenting time arrangement. However, any transition to such a regime, must take into account B.'s unique needs and be done in a way with which B. is comfortable. The focus must be on what parenting arrangement is best for B., and not what the Parties want.

[527] Section 40(4) of the FLA specifies that, 'no particular arrangement is presumed to be in the best interest of the child' and specifically set out that there is no presumption of equal parenting time between guardians.

[528] If parental alienation is proven, which is strongly disputed, in C.H.T. , at paragraph 80, the Court determined that 'an order requiring the child, the alienated parent, or both the child and the parent, to see a family counsellor, is the more appropriate step towards reconciliation', rather than a change in physical custody.

[529] There is no presumption that parental responsibilities should be allocated equally. Since B.'s birth, she has exercised virtually all of the parental responsibilities, although both Parties were able to do so. C.G.H. was not proactive about decisions for B. He relied on, and continues to rely on, S.T.M.

[530] When C.G.H. is involved in making decisions for B., he makes them contrary to her best interests. Examples include his inability to ensure B. properly took her medications and his insistence that B. remain in gym class in the face of her serious struggles and being bullied, and her anxiety increased dramatically.

[531] S.T.M. seeks a Joyce model parental responsibilities order. Such an order would require that C.G.H. actually respond and communicate with her with respect to decisions that must be made for B.'s, but allow S.T.M. to be the final decision maker while allowing C.G.H. to apply for directions if he disagrees.

## Police Enforcement Clause

## C.G.H.

[532] S.T.M. was well aware of her requirement to follow the FCC Order. The Court should not accept that she did everything she could to encourage B. B.'s refusal to go to C.G.H.'s home stopped and his scheduled parenting time occurred immediately after the August 2020 Order containing the police enforcement clause.

[533] The Court should reject S.T.M.'s contention that the previous denial of parenting time and the present compliance is due to the change in the transitions and exchanges in the August 2020 Order.

[534] S.T.M. knew that if she did not provide support for B. to go to C.G.H.'s for their scheduled parenting time, an RCMP colleague would enforce the order.

[535] The police enforcement clause should remain in effect because after it became part of the August 2020 Order, C.G.H.'s parenting time with B. was no longer prevented by S.T.M. and virtually no parenting time was missed.

## S.T.M.

[536] S.T.M. opposes a police enforcement clause.  The courts have been clear that a police enforcement clause is an extraordinary remedy that should be used only sparingly and only in the most egregious circumstances. The Court in D.A.B. stated paragraph 162:

[162] Police enforcement orders are not granted unless there are extraordinary circumstances  and no other

remedy is sufficient to enforce compliance . Not only are enforcement clauses harmful to children, the police have important work to do and should not be diverted from their usual law enforcement responsibilities unless absolutely necessary.

[537] The biggest issue with the FCC Order was that there were far too many transitions. They were very difficult for B. because she needs consistency and routine. S.T.M. strongly advocated for months that the transitions change so that they were not anxiety inducing for B. but C.G.H. refused and posed no alternatives.  The August 2020 Order reduced the transitions and, as a result, there has not been any missed parenting time since because there are fewer transitions and not because of the police enforcement clause.

[538] Since June 2020 that there is no need for a police enforcement clause and having one just increases the risk of harm to B. A police enforcement clause is a tool of last resort and should only be utilized if there is no other order which would be sufficient to secure compliance.  There is no longer justification for such an extraordinary and extreme remedy.

## Parenting Coordinator

## C.G.H.

## [539] S.T.M. agreed that:

- a)  She and C.G.H. do not communicate effectively;
- b)  There is conflict between them that impacts B.;
- c)  It would be beneficial to B. if conflict between her and C.G.H. was reduced;
- d)  B. has some unique developmental needs; and
- e)  She and C.G.H. should be coming to a mutually agreeable parenting goals in B.'s best interests.

[540] S.T.M. actually gave reasons why a Parenting Coordinator would be beneficial. BC Parenting Coordinators Roster Society website states 'Parenting coordination is a process that gives parents … access to a neutral decision-maker who can resolve dayto-day parenting conflicts as they arise, with the goal of minimizing further conflict and additional appearances in court.'

[541] In R.M., the Court appointed a parenting coordinator noting that the parents were unable to achieve rational compromise to important questions involving their children and that that 'court applications are expensive, cumbersome, and at times unhelpful in solving the real problems concerning the care or parenting of children.'

[542] British Columbia Courts have appointed a parenting coordinator in other circumstances to reduce expensive court applications and to provide timely resolution to parenting disputes, including Silverman, L.G. and McClaughry.

[543] The Court should appoint a parenting coordinator in order to avoid future litigation and to make better use of the Parties' and the Court's time and resources.

## S.T.M.

[544] S.T.M. would rather not have a Parenting Coordinator appointed because the decision-making would come from a Parenting Coordinator and she would lose her rights as a mother. She would like to have things sorted out with C.G.H. with the help of an ASD specialist.

[545] S.T.M. maintains that a parenting coordinator is not necessary.  However, if the Court appoints a parenting coordinator, S.T.M. proposes one who has experience working with children with ASD, or a local parenting coordinator in Prince George.

## Family Systems Therapy

## C.G.H.

[546] Dr. Gamache recommended that the Parties and B. participate in a FST program. She said some people are resistant to using FST so a court order is required. FST is in B.'s best interests in the following ways:

- a)  Working with families and family dynamics instead of with each member individually;
- b)  Getting a 360-degree view on each individual family member instead of getting individualistic narratives;
- c)  Assisting with creating healthier relational environments;
- d)  Looking at the family as a 'whole;
- e)  Working on the 'resist/refuse' dynamic; and
- f) Child-focused intervention.

[547] British Columbia Courts have ordered FST and/or reunification in other circumstances including L.D.K., J.C.W and N.B .

[548] Dr. Gamache suggested that Dr. Cottingham be appointed. She has a clinic in Langley with thirteen (13) therapists, who work with high-conflict families including a member who is a behavioural therapist with ASD children. She conducts many sessions remotely.

## S.T.M.

[549] FST and the REACH program have benefits but they are both too expensive and too inconvenient for the Parties to be a realistic option. The REACH program requires approximately 40 - 50 hours at a rate of $300 per hour, lasts for at least a year and requires travel to Vancouver on a regular basis. This is not something that S.T.M. can afford.

[550] She proposes that the Parties retain Ms. Paxton to work with B. and the Parties to better understand a child with ASD with the goal of improving their relationship with B. Ms. Paxton has extensive experience resolving these types of issues.  Any schedule for B. must take into account her unique needs.  Ms. Paxton will be able to help the Parties communicate better with B. to understand why she is resisting spending time with C.G.H.

[551] Ms. Paxton clearly explained that many of the symptoms and behaviours B. exhibits are common among ASD children.  She has devoted her entire practice to helping ASD children and their families resolve the very issues that are hurting this family. She offers her program through video calls and has had success with that method throughout the pandemic. She also charges significantly less at $100 per hour.

## Post Trial Events

## B.

[552] B.'s counsel submitted:

- a)  The environment in S.T.M.'s home is one where there are clear expectations of B. and she has a routine but is allowed some independence;
- b)  The environment in C.G.H.'s home is almost a constant state of stress for B. to the point where she tries to avoid spending time with him and instead isolates herself in her room;
- c)  C.G.H.'s dealings with B., particularly as it applies to her ASD, are often abrupt or belittling and are needlessly cruel. He makes negative comments about her health and weight and does not make her feel good about herself. B. is afraid to discuss matters with C.G.H. because he often becomes angry at or disparaging of her;
- d)  In light of B.'s thoughtfully expressed views, her relationship with C.G.H. is more consistent with estrangement than alienation. B. wishes a better relationship with C.G.H. but in the face of his unwarranted criticism she has largely given up trying to win his approval; and

- e)  B. is not seeking to sever or eliminate the relationship with C.G.H. but she wants to improve it in circumstances where she is able to feel good about herself.

## C.G.H.

[553] S.T.M.'s position throughout this proceeding has been that that consistency, stability and preloading is very important for B. but that she uses those reasons to deny parenting time to C.G.H.

[554] S.T.M.'s description of the ending of her relationship with D.H. and the circumstances surrounding her relationship, romantic or not, with J.L. are unbelievable and her behaviour has posed a danger to B.'s well-being and psychological stability.

[555] The evidence from third parties who provided information to T.C. prior to her filing her affidavit about the secretive nature of S.T.M.'s relationship with J.L. leave a compelling suggestion that S.T.M.'s evidence about the nature of that relationship is untrue. Those third parties are good friends, and in one case a workmate, of J.L.

[556] S.T.M. denied that she told J.L. that C.G.H. had abused her. J.L. told that information to the third parties who disclosed it to T.C.

[557] D.H. was unaware of the nature of S.T.M.'s relationship with J.L. Not long after the April 27, 2022 court appearance, D.H. was asked to move out of S.T.M.'s home. D.H. and his sons were a significant and strong presence in B.'s life. S.T.M. did not present any evidence as to whether that change in circumstances had any effect on B.

[558] After S.T.M.'s separation from D.H., B. did not resume counselling with Dr. Ambrose until November 2022.

[559] S.T.M. has taken the position, without any evidence to support it, that C.G.H. and T.C. are raising false and malicious allegations against her and she blames them for the end of her relationship with D.H. when in fact it was her own actions that caused that separation.

[560] S.T.M. has remained an unreliable witness throughout this proceeding relying on many incredible statements about her actions, particularly as it applies to the nature of her relationship with J.L., and her disclosure about that relationship to both D.H. and the Court.

[561] D.H.'s explanation about why he sent various communications to C.G.H. on two different occasions and then disavowed the authenticity of his allegations against S.T.M. in his oral evidence are simply unbelievable.

## S.T.M.

[562] S.T.M. has not alienated B. from C.G.H. and that is not the cause of his poor relationship with B. S.T.M. has been trying for almost a decade to get C.G.H. to participate more fully in B. life and to communicate cooperatively with both B. and her.

[563] C.G.H. resorts to blaming S.T.M. for the circumstances that B. finds herself in at his home including being bored and spending time alone, not sleeping well, stress and anxiety.

[564] C.G.H. refuses to listen or make any meaningful adjustments to benefit his relationship with B. He has consistently ignored various strategies that have proven to benefit her. He now resorts to saying that B. is lying in her statements to the Court through her counsel.

[565] B. has now had the opportunity to tell the Court her views about C.G.H.'s lack of communication with her, lack of support for her interests, lack of participation in what she wishes to do and his criticism of her school grades, her weight and her ASD. B. is at her wits end to the point where she has contemplated suicide.

[566] C.G.H. refuses to provide B. with consistency and routine, refuses to preload her with information and a schedule, refuses to meet her at her level and communicate with her or to take an interest in her activities. This has resulted in estrangement, not

alienation, largely due to C.G.H.'s actions or inactions in addressing B.'s unique ASD circumstances.

[567] C.G.H. relies on the recommendations in The Report but he has not acted on even the most basic recommendation for him, to contact B. regularly and participate in her school activities.

[568] It is clear from B.'s views that time spent with C.G.H. is time where she feels more stressed, more lonely, more unhappy and that impacts her mood, her anxiety her school work, her friendships her self-esteem in virtually every aspect of her life.

[569] Any increase in C.G.H.'s parenting time with B. prior to their relationship improving will result in a young woman who is drastically more sad and stressed. Until C.G.H. makes some meaningful changes to his approach in dealing with B., their relationship will never succeed. On the other hand, the evidence is clear that B. is happy, content and well-adjusted at S.T.M.'s home.

[570] B. is a mature, intelligent, capable person who gets good grades, has skills in caring for animals and is a responsible babysitter who organizes her activities largely independent of S.T.M. The Court cannot ignore that B.'s views are her own; they are real and valid and must be carefully considered. Ignoring her views will not fix the relationship difficulties with C.G.H.; he must take steps to do that.

## Legal Expenses and Penalties

## C.G.H.

[571] Unreasonable withholding of parenting time is described in Sections 61, 62 and 63 of the FLA allowing the Court to make a variety of enforcement orders.

[572] Early in the litigation C.G.H. applied for orders that S.T.M.:

- a)  Pay the legal expenses incurred by him to obtain the court-ordered parenting time and to post a bond of $5,000 against further denials; and
- b)  Pay to him $5,000 as compensation for the breaches of the FCC Order pursuant to Sections 227, 228 and 230 of the FLA .

[573] These payments are necessary because if orders are ignored without consequence respect for the Court will be undermined resulting in further breaches of orders and enforcement applications.

[574] C.G.H. should be reimbursed, in whole or in part, for the $30,078 in the legal fees incurred to enforce the FCC Order for his denied parenting time as was done in J.C.P. and discussed in A.N .

[575] C.G.H. sees no need for a $5,000 bond to secure the parenting time terms in the final order if a police enforcement clause is included. However, due to her breaches of previous conduct orders a bond is necessary to ensure that S.T.M. complies with any conduct orders made.

[576] It is imperative that C.G.H. be granted 39 days make-up parenting time for the days wrongfully denied by S.T.M. The Report confirmed that compensatory parenting time is important to show B. that both Parties are equal, that they love her and care for her.

[577] The facts here are very similar to A.N. with a high conflict history of breaches of parenting time and conduct orders regarding a 14-year-old son and a 16-year-old daughter who had ASD and anxiety. The father claimed that, despite his best efforts, the children, primarily the 16-year-old daughter, refused to go to their mother's home for parenting time and he could not force them to go. The Court held that the father had breached the parenting time order and thus denied the mother her court-ordered parenting time. The Court referred to K.R. , at paragraphs 57 - 59 and said:

[57] Parenting time that has been included in an agreement or that has been ordered must be respected. If not appealed or varied, compliance  cannot  be  viewed  as  optional.  The  time constraint  in  s.  61(1)(b)  ensures  some  contemporaneity between the alleged denial and the remedy, thus serving as well to focus on the best interests of the children. Section 62 ensures reasonable  denials  are  permitted,  again  consistent the best interests of the children being the only consideration.

[58] In my view, the objective of the provisions is to give the court a broad discretion that can be adapted to each unique situation. It would be inconsistent with the broad objectives to limit the remedies to only discrete events of an express denial.

[59] A pattern of wrongful conduct that frustrates an agreement or order such that parenting time is not fully available is a wrongful denial. A parent need not say the word 'no' to scheduled parenting time for them to communicate a denial nor must they physically prevent the parenting time from occurring for it to be a wrongful denial. The cumulative effect of less definitive words and actions may suffice.

[Emphasis added.]

[578] S.T.M.'s conduct is similar and undermined C.G.H.'s time with B. by;

- a)  Stressing how much she missed B. when she was at C.G.H.'s home, and by sending a barrage of electronic communications when she was there;
- b)  Allowing B. to decide whether she would go for parenting time with C.G.H. and telling C.G.H. it was up to B. whether she went or not; and
- c)  Not exercising her authority to ensure B. went with C.G.H. until the imposition of the police enforcement clause after which no parenting time was missed.

[579] In Waters , the Court held that a parent should be doing anything in their power to encourage court-ordered parenting time. As demonstrated by the numerous missed Sunday parenting times neither S.T.M.'s nor D.H.'s attempts to facilitate parenting time between B. and C.G.H. were adequate.

## S.T.M.

[580] Relying on Sections 228, 230 and 61 of the FLA , C.G.H. claims for reimbursement of legal expenses from and payment of penalties by S.T.M. in relation to missed parenting time.

[581] He relies on A.N . but in that case, the Court dismissed the application seeking reimbursement for legal fees, stating at paragraph 27 that, "there is insufficient evidence before me to entertain such a remedy". He also relies on J.C.P . but in that case, the order for reimbursement of legal fees was based on the Hague Convention. C.G.H. presented no cases in which the Court allowed the reimbursement of legal fees for a denial of parenting time.

[582] There was no evidence presented about the legal expenses. The bills were not tendered and counsel was not cross examined on the necessity of the work, as was the case in J.C.P. As discussed in L.S ., there is no evidence of what the expenses were, what they were incurred for, given the many heads of relief claimed at the time, or whether they were reasonably and necessarily incurred. The Court should dismiss the application.

[583] The Parties' testimony and the electronic communications demonstrate that until the summer of 2019, C.G.H.'s parenting time was sporadic, and at all times facilitated and encouraged by S.T.M. She facilitated parenting time between B. and him whenever he requested, and even offered time when it was not.

[584] C.G.H. mischaracterized the missed parenting time that occurred between September 2019 and June 2020. He ignores that many of B.'s actions occurred without S.T.M.'s knowledge or encouragement, such as B. going directly from school to S.T.M.'s home. He also erroneously assumed that S.T.M. and D.H. were actively encouraging, or "coaching" B. to resist spending time with him.

[585] S.T.M. and D.H. spoke about the efforts made by them to improve the transitions and to encourage B. to go with C.G.H. S.T.M. tried multiple strategies and made numerous suggestions to improve things while C.G.H. made no suggestions and did not respond to S.T.M.'s attempts to improve the situation.

[586] C.G.H.'s spreadsheet supporting his allegation that S.T.M. wrongfully withheld B. from him during his scheduled parenting time contrary to the FCC Order and Section 61 of the FLA shows that his missed parenting times were almost exclusively on Sundays when the transitions were especially difficult for B. There were almost no issues during the Friday night or Tuesday evening exchanges and parenting time.

[587] S.T.M. did not wrongfully withhold B. from C.G.H. The opposite is true, she did everything she could to follow the Court's orders, while trying to minimize the harm to B. in a very difficult situation. S.T.M. never encouraged B.'s resistance.  She literally fought with her each Sunday to get into the vehicle.  She tried a variety of strategies, without any support from C.G.H., but they were unsuccessful.

[588] At paragraphs 60-63 of K.R., the Court analysed Section 61 of the FLA :

- [60] When a child is resisting the parenting time accorded a parent by the order or agreement, it is appropriate to view the origins of that resistance. A parent who encourages that resistance by words and/or actions can, in my view, be said to be denying parenting time and, depending on the circumstances, it may be a wrongful denial.
- [61] In circumstances such as this case, an assessment of the parent's response to that resistance can be critical. If the response is situationally appropriate but ultimately unsuccessful in overcoming the resistance, the parent should not be found to have wrongfully denied parenting time…
- [63] Where, however, a parent agrees to forgo scheduled parenting time because of the resistance of the child, it may preclude a finding that the other parent has denied parenting time but the circumstances of such agreement must be reviewed carefully. The genesis of the resistance is again critical, as is the other parent's response to that resistance.

Acquiescence or even agreement alone should not end the analysis. The underlying circumstances must be examined to prevent defeating the utility of these sections in ensuring the best interests of children are served.

[589] This was an impossible situation for S.T.M.  She was doing what she could to follow an order that was clearly harming B.  Short of physically removing B. from the vehicle, which neither Party was prepared to do, there is nothing further that could have been done.

[590] Dr. Ambrose explained that B. struggles with transitions and changes to her routine. Ms. Paxton said that these issues are especially difficult for children with ASD. B. cannot be treated the same way as other children. S.T.M. acted in a way that was situationally appropriate, but ultimately unsuccessful. The Court should find that S.T.M. did not wrongfully withhold B. from C.G.H.

[591] If the Court concludes there has been a wrongful denial of parenting time, there is discretion, like in K.R ., not to impose a penalty. It is not necessary to fine S.T.M. for the missed parenting time. She has proven that she will comply with the Court's orders and a fine would not affect the goal of ensuring compliance. A solution has already been found. Application of Section 61 of the FLA should be retrospective only as decided in D.R., S.G. and D.M.F .

[592] Similarly, an order for make-up parenting time would not benefit B. An increase of parenting time with C.G.H. for 39 days, would only introduce further changes and instability into her routine. B. does best with consistency and routine and a schedule which is not consistent and dramatically increases the amount of time that she spends away from S.T.M. would be detrimental to B.'s health and well-being.

## CPIC Entry

## C.G.H.

[593] As a result of an order disclosing documents from the RCMP investigation, it was discovered that a Canadian Police Information Centre ('CPIC') entry had been made that showed C.G.H. 'May be of concern to Firearms Officers.' There was no explanation or documentation as to why C.G.H. might be of concern to anyone. Sgt. Collins professed to know nothing about CPIC entries in general and the one related to C.G.H. in particular.

[594] C.G.H.'s renewal application of a Possession and Acquisition License (PAL) required for his fieldwork was initially denied because of the CPIC entry. After he filed a complaint with the RCMP, he received within a very short time, confirmation that the CPIC entry had been removed and his license was being 'fast-tracked'.

[595] C.G.H. believes S.T.M. had something to do with the CPIC entry.

## S.T.M.

[596] S.T.M. denies any knowledge of or involvement in the CPIC entry made about C.G.H.

## DISCUSSION

## Credibility and Reliability

[624] In any family law case, the proof of facts at issue is determined on a balance of probabilities, what version of events is more likely than not. The Court's determination of what has been proven is based on the totality of the evidence presented by the Parties taking into account the source, consistencies and inconsistencies, reliance on recollection alone or documentary support, and the interest of the person giving the

evidence in the outcome of the case. The Court is permitted to accept and rely on all, some or none of a witness' evidence.

[625] In Younesi , Kent J. discussed recollection and evidence in paragraphs [55] through [58] as follows:

[55] A human being's perception and memory of events are fallible. Memories are fragmentary, suggestible, and malleable. They often contain amnesic gaps, information out of order, guesses, and incorrect details. They are subject to decay, interference, distortion, and constructive error. Witnesses in a trial usually do their best to provide detailed evidence about a sequence of events or the content of conversations, but there is a great deal of room for error and reconstruction, and conflicting testimony is commonplace.

[56] The primary role of a trial judge is to make findings of fact, i.e. to determine what happened in any given case and to apply the law to those facts in order to generate the appropriate legal result. Findings of fact are based on admissible evidence presented to the court. As in this case, that evidence can include testimony under oath from witnesses respecting their actions and observations, as well as documents or other material marked as exhibits. The role of the trial judge is to appropriately weigh all of this evidence and to determine whether any alleged fact has been proved in accordance with the applicable standard of proof - in civil cases, on a balance of probabilities.

[57] The assessment of a witness's oral testimony necessarily entails an assessment of credibility. The role of the court is not usually reduced to simply choosing between two or more versions of events, and it is not an all-or-nothing process. In determining facts, i.e. making findings as to what actually occurred in any given case, the court is free to reject some aspects of a witness's evidence while accepting others and, indeed, to assign different weight to different parts of the witness's evidence.

[58] Accepting all or part of the testimony of any witness involves an assessment of credibility (truthfulness/honesty) and reliability (accuracy) of both the witness and the evidence. That in turn involves consideration of many different factors including:

-  consistency of the witness's account of events;
-  consistency with other evidence brought forward by witnesses, documents, or physical evidence;
-  whether the evidence is reliably corroborated or contradicted by other evidence;
-  the witness's ability to reliably recall and communicate details;
-  the demeanour of the witness and whether the questions are answered in a frank and forthright fashion without evasion, speculation, or exaggeration; and
-  the inherent plausibility of the evidence and its consistency with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole.

[626] In S.R.M. the Court described credibility in paragraph 114:

[114] Credibility is an assessment of the trustworthiness of a their testimony changes during direct and cross-examination.

witness' testimony. This assessment involves the examination of various factors including the demeanour of the witness, their ability to resist the temptation to modify their recollection of events to suit their needs, and whether The validity of the evidence depends on whether it is consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole. The Court must determine which version of the events is most consistent with the 'preponderance of probabilities which a practical and informed person would really recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions' (citations omitted)

[627] These approaches are consistent with previous decisions concerning credibility and reliability including Faryna and Bradshaw.

[628] It is necessary to be careful in relying too heavily on a witnesses' demeanour to determine credibility as there is a risk of misinterpreting the testimony of a better actor as truthful or the poor presentation of an honest witness as deceptive.

[629] The evidence of both Parties had weaknesses and shortcomings that undermined both their credibility and reliability. Neither Party was a 'balanced' witness. The same assessment applies to some of the other witnesses. A witness is 'balanced' when they shy away from minimization or exaggeration, acknowledge memory gaps and honestly address difficult facts or weaknesses in their evidence. They answer questions in a responsive and thoughtful manner and do not attempt to respond strategically, offer negative editorial comments about the other Party, attempt to control the narrative or have an agenda.

[630] Both Parties' evidence included examples of nonresponsive monologues, condescending comments, and obtuse or evasive argumentative responses.

[631] S.T.M. was prone to using expansive examples of her good efforts and C.G.H.'s lack of effort. She often fell back on the mantra that things would be better for B. by retaining an ASD expert while rejecting other avenues that could assist in resolving the difficult circumstances B. and the Parties face.

[632] In response to C.G.H.'s allegation that she suffers from anxiety S.T.M. said several times that she was never diagnosed with anxiety. What she did not say was whether any medical professional, family member or friends ever suggested that she be assessed for anxiety or that she had been assessed and reassured that she does not have anxiety. That information would have been helpful in considering the evidence and may have assisted Dr. Aube in her work.

[633] At times, S.T.M. was a nervous, animated and anxious witness. She was also animated and demonstrative when listening to some of the other witnesses. In light of her ASD, if B. observed similar behaviour by S.T.M., especially surrounding parenting time with C.G.H., it could have increased her anxiety symptoms.

[634] C.G.H. often slipped in references to S.T.M.'s relationship-ending infidelity in circumstances where it had no relation to the question asked or the relevant answer. He

continues to harbour resentment towards S.T.M. and that has tainted his view of her since the separation and throughout his evidence.

[635] C.G.H. either condoned or encouraged T.C. to allege further infidelity by S.T.M. and to make inquiries of her personal history after all of the trial evidence concluded, depriving S.T.M. of any realistic opportunity to refute it. T.C.'s other evidence was generally fair and balanced.

[636] C.G.H. vehemently denied almost all negative statements B. made about or attributed to him. During his evidence, he responded to some questions with aggression or indignation verging on anger. Those reactions give credence to S.T.M.'s allegations that he was condescending and superior during their relationship. It provides a possible explanation for some of B.'s complaints about the nature of their relationship and her fear of him.

[637] C.G.H., through his counsel, provided unsolicited information to Dr. Aube without S.T.M. and her counsel's knowledge and consent. Much of that information was unsubstantiated and shown at trial to be incorrect or misleading. Dr. Aube relied on that information and S.T.M. did not have the opportunity to gather and present information to refute C.G.H.'s information.

[638] C.G.H. also provided The Report to several third parties without S.T.M.'s knowledge or consent violating her and B.'s privacy. Those actions indicate a lack of fair mindedness and commitment to the process by C.G.H. which, in turn, undermines his credibility.

[639] Dr. Welder's report was comprehensive and I accept her opinions and recommendations about B.'s ASD. Both Parties said that they were informing themselves about ASD to understand better B.'s circumstances and to be able to assist her.

[640] The evidence of Dr. Rocha, Dr. Ambrose, Dr. Gamache and Ms. Paxton was clear and helpful and their opinions, within their area of expertise, assisted me in my deliberations. Sgt. Collins and SW Weibe gave their evidence in a professional and straightforward manner.

[641] I give little weight to what Ms. Butler may have told either of the Parties about B.'s challenges except to note that I agree with S.T.M.'s statement that Ms. Butler's comment that there was nothing wrong with B. was incorrect.

[642] The family and friends evidence was, in general, honest and unbiased recollections of what they observed and, in some instances, what B. told them. That was helpful to me in obtaining better insights about B.

[643] R.M.'s evidence made clear that he holds continuing animus toward C.G.H. That carried over to a threatening gesture he allegedly made to C.G.H. when leaving the courtroom.

[644] D.H.'s evidence was very problematic. His actions in misleading C.G.H. after he and S.T.M. separated caused considerable expense and stress to the Parties and so undermined the rest of his evidence I cannot give it any weight unless other evidence corroborates it.

[645] Although she did not give evidence under oath, B. presented her views and wishes in hope of a particular outcome, separate from the Parties' positions. I must consider them in determining her best interests. My deliberations were complicated by B.'s ASD and a lack of evidence about how it specifically affects her in a number of areas.

[646] There are clear examples in the evidence where B. misled S.T.M. while she was at C.G.H.'s home causing S.T.M. unnecessary concern. There is also the circumstances of her disclosure to the school social worker. Almost all of her allegations

were restatements of complaints Dr. Ambrose dealt with years before. B. showed no regret or remorse for her actions even though they caused great difficulty for C.G.H.

[647] It was also difficult to determine whether some of her recent complaints about C.G.H.'s behaviour in calling her a liar and denigrating her ASD symptoms were reports of new concerns or repetition of earlier incidents.

[648] In addition, I also have to remember that even S.T.M. has difficulty, from time to time, in determining whether B.'s reports to her of C.G.H.'s actions are based on perceptions influenced by her ASD or objectively plausible.

[649] After considering all the evidence, I conclude that at times C.G.H. has expressed to B. his rigid views about her diagnoses, accused her of being untruthful and, spoken to her sternly or harshly with little regard for B's perception and response.

## Communication

[650] In highly acrimonious proceedings such as this is important to keep in mind B.'s best interests when considering the conduct of the Parties. A useful observation in that regard can be found in K.D.P. , where Justice Goepel said:

- [1] No parents are perfect. All have flaws of one kind or another. If families stay together, except in those rare circumstances in which a child is found to be in need of protection, the state and the courts allow imperfect parents to raise their children as best they can. The children, in most cases, are no worse for wear for the experience.
- [2] If families separate, however, and issues of custody and access arise, in the guise of determining the best interests of the child, a parent's flaws of character and conduct are put under a microscope ….

[651] The adversarial nature of litigation can exacerbate underlying acrimonious feelings of the Parties. In N.R.G., Justice Kent commented at paragraph 293:

[293] In high-conflict matrimonial litigation, such as the case at bar, the adversarial system often serves to only increase the acrimony between the parties. People who once loved each other exchange vile insults and attach nasty labels to perceived deficiencies in character. Friends, family, police, teachers and ministry officials are summoned to denigrate one parent and advocate on behalf of the other. The interests of the children, best served by the positive involvement of both parents, are sacrificed on the altar of self-centered animosity.

[652] The Parties' voluminous electronic communication history clearly shows that sometimes they were cordial and cooperative while in many other circumstances they were argumentative, accusatorial, uncivil and disrespectful. There were many occasions where S.T.M. relayed relevant information to and sought a response from C.G.H. where he simply ignored her and did not respond. There were other occasions when C.G.H. sought information from S.T.M. about B. She replied that it was none of his business or gave him incorrect information.

[653] S.T.M. said that there were many times she tried to inform and explain to C.G.H. that B.'s many anxiety influenced behaviours impacted on B.'s wish to spend time with him and that he should respect and act on those concerns but he refused. C.G.H. replied that S.T.M. was often exaggerating or simply making up issues to interfere with his time with B. and that S.T.M.'s actions negatively affected B. When B. was with him, their time together was generally positive and enjoyable for both of them.

[654] The Parties have a history of significant disagreements about the nature, severity of and the appropriate treatment for B.'s interrelated health and behavioural challenges. C.G.H. raised 'concerns' about B.'s diagnoses and treatment but did not present any medical evidence or learned literature to disprove her diagnoses of OCD and ASD.

[655] Dr. Ambrose raised a valid concern about C.G.H.'s perception and acceptance of the approach taken in assisting B. saying that he told her that he does not accept B's OCD diagnosis and questions the ASD diagnosis.

[656] C.G.H. was very critical of S.T.M. not getting assistance for B. when Dr. Ambrose closed her practice for several months. But, he did nothing to seek out alternative therapists or ascertain when Dr. Ambrose returned to practise. That indicates a lack of attention by him to an important component of ensuring B.'s best interests.

[657] C.G.H. did not demonstrate that Dr. Ambrose's approach was inappropriate or that it has not shown positive results. There is nothing to suggest that Dr. Ambrose's work with B. is lacking in any way. She has built a trusting bond with B. and has made significant progress in addressing B.'s many challenges.

[658] Dr. Ambrose's approach benefits B. Given the high level of animosity between the Parties, I will not leave her in the middle of competing treatment perspectives. That will be resolved by granting all the duties and responsibilities under Section 41 (f) of the FLA to S.T.M.

[659] Dr. Ambrose may no longer require joint sessions with S.T.M. and B. but they may need to continue with C.G.H. and B. If that is the case, S.T.M. must ensure that appointments with Dr. Ambrose, although scheduled by her, are arranged on C.G.H.'s schedule and occur as much as possible during his parenting time so he can take B. to and participate in the appointments.

[660] S.T.M. will be required to inform C.G.H. of B.'s all other planned appointments and sessions with all other health care professionals, in case he wishes to attend. She will be required to instruct all health professionals who have contact with B. to supply C.G.H. with all information he may request as provided for in Section 41(j) of the FLA . The Parties will comply with and follow all recommendations for B.'s treatment made by her medical and counselling professionals.

[661] C.G.H. raised the valid concern of not knowing about B.'s general health or the prescription and over-the-counter medications she takes. S.T.M. must advise him about all medications B. is taking or has available to her. The Parties will supervise the proper administration of medications prescribed for or consumed by B. The Parties must

promptly inform the other of any injuries, illness, mental health concerns, or other significant events regarding B. that take place during their respective parenting time.

## Dr. Aube and The Report

[662] C.G.H. submits that S.T.M. should pay an equal portion of Dr. Aube's fees for The Report. Both the exchange of correspondence between counsel and the joint retainer letter to Dr. Aube clearly indicate that C.G.H. was prepared to pay the entire cost of Dr. Aube's work subject to a $3000 contribution from S.T.M. I will not disturb that arrangement.

[663] Counsel did not provide any case law to support their positions. Unlike the circumstances in Brennan and Sandhu where the Section 211 report was Court ordered and the Court determined that there should be an equal sharing of the expense here there was a specific agreement on who would pay what amount for The Report.

[664] The same arrangement was not in place with regard to Dr. Aube's attendance at trial. Brennan provides direction on that matter. Unless I determine that the attendance of Dr. Aube was unhelpful or unnecessary, the cost of her attendance should be borne equally by the Parties. Despite my reservations about The Report and Dr. Aube's evidence, it is appropriate for the Parties to share the cost of her trial attendance. That will require a contribution of $5000 from S.T.M. to C.G.H.

[665] In the exchange of correspondence C.G.H. claimed that S.T.M. was 'purposefully alienating' B. from him and that there was no one in Prince George capable of conducting a Section 211 report that encompassed that topic. S.T.M. counsel's reply denied any alienation by her so she knew the subject was an issue.

[666] The retainer letter asks Dr. Aube to complete her investigations and prepare The Report referring to the language of Section 211. That wording is broad enough to encompass practically everything that might affect B.'s best interests including such

topics as estrangement, enmeshment and parental alienation. There was nothing wrong with Dr. Aube investigating all of those issues.

## Estrangement

[667] C.G.H.'s absences from B.'s early life because of his employment, schooling and professional obligations contributed to the estrangement that developed between them. B.'s routine in S.T.M.'s home compared to C.G.H.'s changing availability due to his schedule combined with her undiagnosed ASD also contributed to that situation.

[668] C.G.H. drew erroneous conclusions about S.T.M.'s breastfeeding routine. He felt excluded from B. and blames S.T.M. for that. He acknowledged to Dr. Aube that he was not a full time participating parent. His well-founded disagreement with S.T.M. about B.'s toileting practices as she grew older further distanced him from B. The Parties also disagreed on how to address many of B.'s ASD driven behaviours. Those disagreements further distressed B. because of different expectations of her in each home.

[669] The Chicken Coop Incident further solidified B.'s estrangement from C.G.H. Although, at the time, the reasons were unknown to C.G.H., his angry reaction to the situation, as interpreted by B. though her ASD lens, had a profound effect on her that persists to today. After that, B. developed even more difficulty in transitioning between the homes and exhibiting healthy bonding with C.G.H.

[670] I do not accept that any major stress on B.'s relationship with C.G.H. arose because she did not tell him about D.H. and his sons living in S.T.M.'s home or that S.T.M. specifically told B. to conceal that information.

[671] I do accept that S.T.M. told B. not to discuss with C.G.H. what went on in her home nor to answer his questions about that topic. B. took that directive to apply to D.H. and his sons. Although it did not cause B. additional stress, it did add to further estrangement in their relationship.

[672] I also conclude that although C.G.H. was aware of S.T.M.'s relationship with D.H. through their electronic communications, he was unaware of the particular circumstances of who was residing in her home.

[673] Although the Parties are entitled to their privacy, S.T.M.'s position that C.G.H. should not be aware of who resides in her home or that she did not think it was necessary to tell C.G.H. is not in B.'s best interests. Each of the Parties should have some specific knowledge of who B. is residing with and in what circumstances. That will be a requirement of each of them going forward.

## Enmeshment

[674] Healthy child development requires a child to explore safely the world while being able to develop their independence and enhance their life skills. Healthy boundaries are necessary from physical, psychological and behavioural perspectives both between the each of Parties and B., and between the Parties and their two homes.

[675] Even before separation, the Parties relationship was foundering. C.G.H. felt excluded and S.T.M. felt ignored. S.T.M. spent much more time with B. and displayed some insecurities and anxiousness surrounding B.'s separation from her although she did take positive steps to ensure contact between B. and C.G.H., based on his availability, for many months after the separation. Despite those efforts, B. became more aligned with S.T.M. and more distanced from C.G.H. S.T.M. unintentionally reinforced B.'s closeness to her. However, she went further than that in several areas.

[676] To determine whether enmeshment developed I must consider:

- a)  S.T.M.'s parenting fostered an environment amenable to enmeshment. Examples of this are B.'s constant worries about S.T.M., her repeated statements that S.T.M. would 'die from a broken heart' and her numerous communications with S.T.M. at all hours when she is with C.G.H.;
- b)  S.T.M. did not disclose information about B. to C.G.H. in a variety of circumstances and on a variety of topics including [omitted for

publication]' health, B.'s medication for minor health issues, B. feeling unsafe and seeing devils in his home and B. expressing self-harm and suicidal thoughts;

- c)  S.T.M.'s adoption and endorsement many of B.'s refusals to have parenting time with C.G.H.;
- d)  Several examples in The Report and other evidence of B. making statements similar to S.T.M. as if they were speaking with one voice;
- e)  Many, but not all, of B.'s complaints about C.G.H. appear scripted, without objective substantiation and designed to cast him in a negative light; and
- f) The lack of evidence whether B.'s ASD affected or influenced the development of enmeshment.

[677] I conclude that there is enmeshment in B.'s relationship with S.T.M. but I do not know if B.'s ASD contributed to or reinforced that situation. Expert assistance will be required to address and diminish the enmeshment.

## Alienation

[678] In Williamson, the Court of Appeal adopted the description of alienation given in D.S.W. at para. 64:

[64]… the notion that the child's decision to refuse to have a relationship with the targeted parent is without justification or without convincing reason. If there is a reason given by the child for taking the extreme step of refusing to have a relationship with a parent, it will often be out of all proportion to the decision taken. The reasons for such decisions need to be assessed with the particular personality and experience of the child involved. What may seem a thin or unconvincing rationale for one child may have a much more convincing force in the context of the personality and experience of another child.

[679] The differences between the concepts of alienation and estrangement was discussed in N.R.G. at paragraphs 276-278 referred to in C.G.H.'s submissions.

[680] Williamson directs that the serious nature of an allegation of alienation requires proof through expert evidence after the Court considers the threshold requirements of admissibility, its gatekeeper function and the balance of potential risks and benefits of admitting the evidence. That requires careful consideration of The Report.

[681] Immediately after The Report was released, S.T.M. and her parents filed a formal complaint with the College about Dr. Aube. The College conducted an investigation based on its numerous correspondences with S.T.M. and Dr. Aube. The College's report on its investigation made it clear that it was not investigating the evidence reviewed by, the opinions and recommendations in The Report or the methodology employed by Dr. Aube.

[682] Their task, as mandated by the legislation was to determine if Dr. Aube acted in a fashion that was in breach of her professional duties or the College's Code of Conduct. In the end, the College concluded that, with one small exception, she had not done so. The College's report does not address all the same factual issues faced by the Court and its findings do not have any bearing on my duty to make decisions only in B.'s best interests.

[683] The Courts in British Columbia have qualified Dr. Aube as an expert in areas similar to the services she provided to the Parties in preparing The Report and testifying at trial. The Court brought several examples of that case law to the attention of counsel. In some cases, like P.G., J.M.C., B.C.B. and K.M.H., her recommendations were noted, favourably commented on, or implemented by the Court. In other cases, like K.W., N.J., and S.R.M ., her reports and recommendations were rejected and in some cases, criticized as biased or advocating for one party.

[684] M.F.W. provides guidance on how the Court should receive and consider expert opinions presented in a Section 211 report:

[22] There are several decisions of the Supreme Court of British Columbia that demonstrate that the Court is not

required to follow the recommendations of the appointed 'expert' and indeed, that the Court should not 'abdicate' its role in favour of an assessor's recommendations: see King v. Borserio 2018 BCCA 308 at para. 76. As observed in A.P. v. J.C. 2018 BCSC 1381:

The context under s. 211 is not comparable to that of an expert retained by a party in a non-family case. As observed by Parrett J. in Goudie v. Goudie , 1993 CanLII 1073 (BC SC), [1993] B.C.J. No. 1049 (S.C.), at para. 33:

[33] …The procedure anticipated by s. 15 is one in which the investigator interviews the people involved, observes the relationship and interaction between the spouses and the children and reports those observations, facts and impressions to the court. In the truest sense these individuals act as the courts eyes and ears in what are all too frequently highly emotional areas of conflict. The safeguards built into the process include the early delivery of the investigation reports, the opportunity to call the investigator to the witness stand and the opportunity to respond to the report generally by other evidence.

FRA s. 15 reports were not governed completely by the evidentiary rules which would be in effect when dealing with reports requisitioned by one of the parties from an expert: Wu v. Sun et al , 2006 BCSC 1891, at para. 3. Similar legal principles can be applied to both s. 15 FRA and s. 211 FLA assessments or reports: K.B. v. J.B. , 2015 BCSC 704, at para. 6.

The s. 211 author may provide an opinion, but it is for the court to decide the matters at issue: Johnson v. Skillen , 2009 BCSC 209, at para. 8 ; I.J.G.P.G. v. K.M., 2016 BCSC 1072, at para. 100; A.L. v. L.W., 2017 BCSC 964, at para. 8 . The court must not abdicate its role in favour of the recommendations made: King v. Borserio , 2018 BCCA 308, at para. 76. Regardless of the information that goes to the report writer, the court ultimately has the discretion to review the background information presented in the report, carry out an independent assessment based on the evidence at trial, and come to a different conclusion as to the best interests of the child: K.B. v. J.B . …

[685] D.L.M. , described the purpose and function of Section 211 in paragraphs [37] and [39] as:

[37] The purpose and function of s. 211 reports were described in K.M.W. v. L.J.W., 2010 BCCA 572. Madam Justice Huddart said:

[48] …custody cases are not an ordinary civil contest. Whether held under the Divorce Act, the Family Relations Act, or child protection legislation , a custody hearing is intended to be a respectful enquiry by a court into the best interests of the children whose parents cannot agree on appropriate child care arrangements or whose child care capacity has been questioned. While a custody dispute that ends in court is often, as in this case, a heated adversarial contest in which the parents have become locked, supported in their perspective by family and close friends, and especially by the children's grandparents, the task of the court in every such dispute is always to keep the focus on the children's best interests, as it has been since the court's parens patriae jurisdiction was first invoked to protect children centuries ago.

[49] The task is among the most difficult trial judges face, as it is among the toughest work lawyers are asked to do. No trial is perfect; resources of time and money are always limited. An endless fight between two parents is the best guarantee of a poor outcome for a child, as ordinary experience and common sense tell us, and as every child care expert repeats to every parent and every court in every case, including this one. Guided by relevant statutory guidelines, counsel must put before the trial judge a sufficient picture of the children's circumstances to permit a fair decision as to a care regime that would be in the best interests among those available at the time of the trial: Bain v. Bain, 2008 BCCA 49.

[50] To aid the court and counsel in their respective tasks, in British Columbia, counsel and the court are permitted to seek the assistance of

an independent and impartial investigator and to call on that investigator to make recommendations based on the results of that investigation: Family Relations Act , s. 15. The facts stated in the investigator's report are prima facie evidence of their truth: B. v. B ., 2004 BCSC 72 …

[39] These reports, of course, are not binding on the Court. As was so aptly stated by Mr. Justice Voith when a judge of this Court, in K.B. v. J.B. , 2015 BCSC 704:

[10] ... Regardless of the information that goes to the report writer, the court ultimately has the discretion to review the background information presented in the report, carry out an independent assessment based on the evidence at trial, and come to a different conclusion as to the best interests of the child; T.C. v. S.C. , 2013 BCPC 217; Plant v. Kempton , 2011 BCCA 171.

I further note that more recently, in M.F.W. v. M.A.H ., 2020 BCCA 284 at para. 22, Madam Justice Newbury, in a unanimous decision, endorsed the view that the trial court should not abdicate its role in determining the best interests of a child in favour of the recommendations made by the s. 211 report writer.

[686] C.G.H.'s allegations of parental alienation through S.T.M.'s unintentional or intentional actions received support in The Report. The College's response to the M.s' complaint determined there was no unprofessional conduct by Dr. Aube but did not comment on the validity of her opinions or recommendations.

[687] Some of the M.s' complaints about The Report do raise concerns about the validity of some of the opinions and recommendations. Dr. Aube was entitled to take all investigatory steps she felt were necessary in acting as the 'eyes and ears' of the Court. However, that cloak of authority carries with it the responsibility that she ensured that both Parties were treated equitably.

[688] C.G.H. provided additional materials to Dr. Aube at the start of the process. She relied on them, at least in part, when she went through the interview process with

S.T.M. and the subsequent writing of The Report. S.T.M. was caught off guard by the additional material and informed Dr. Aube immediately about some of the inaccurate information.

[689] What should have occurred at that point, but did not, was for Dr. Aube to ensure that both Parties had an equal opportunity to present any additional material before she proceeded further. That equitable arrangement was the foundation of the jointly submitted documentation provided to her as part of her retainer. The trial evidence revealed that C.G.H.'s late-delivered materials contained incorrect, inaccurate and misleading information. At this point in time there is no way for the me to determine how much that additional material affected Dr. Aube's evidence gathering process and factfinding and how that may have influenced The Report's opinions and recommendations in favour of C.G.H.

[690] Dr. Aube acknowledged considerable expertise in the area of ASD. When she interviewed B. there was no formal diagnosis that B. had ASD. But, there was considerable documentation and information provided to Dr. Aube by the Parties indicating that many of B.'s behaviours were not neuro-typical. The Report makes no mention of any consideration given to other possible reasons why B. had issues with building a stronger bond relationship with C.G.H. based on the available information and Dr. Aube's experience.

[691] At trial, Dr. Aube agreed with B.'s ASD diagnosis by Dr. Welder but that she was not familiar with present ASD assessment procedures. She emphatically stated that B.'s ASD diagnosis would not have affected how she interacted with B. and that it would not change The Report's opinions and recommendations. That unwavering view concerned me because it suggests that Dr. Aube gave little consideration to other possible causes for B.'s behaviour during their interview and in general.

[692] Dr. Aube's experience and expertise in the preparation of Section 211 reports requires that I afford a level of deference to her opinions and recommendations.

However, in addition to the concerns raised above, The Report and Dr. Aube's subsequent testimony must be considered and weighed against all of the trial evidence.

[693] Dr. Aube only interviewed and observed the Parties and B. for a few hours. I had the opportunity to observe the Parties and their witnesses for many days. In addition, I had the benefit of the submissions of experienced counsel retained on B.'s behalf who had the opportunity to review all of the pleadings, transcripts and evidence and spent several hours receiving her instructions.

[694] Dr. Aube had access to the jointly disclosed documents plus C.G.H.'s additional documents. That was only a small proportion of the many thousands of pages I examined which included communication between the Parties, communication between B. and each of the Parties and communication with third parties.

[695] The Report was delivered in November 2019, and the final submissions in the litigation were not made until January 2023. As such, Dr. Aube's information is dated and she had limited opportunity to examine all of the circumstances that have occurred in the intervening years.

[696] In the final analysis, there are parts of The Report that align with the other evidence presented at trial that suggest 'alienation' between B. and C.G.H. However, I do not agree with The Report's opinion that it is 'parental alienation' caused intentionally or unintentionally by S.T.M. I do conclude that any alienation is the result of B.'s estrangement from C.G.H., her enmeshment with S.T.M., the different interpersonal challenges that have evolved from the Parties actions or inactions and B.'s responses to them arising from her observations through the lens of her many diagnosed conditions.

[697] This finding does not mean that S.T.M. can continue her present approach in her parenting of B. She and B. are a very close team but every team requires a leader. S.T.M. must assume that role and re-establish her parental authority. There must be some dramatic changes in how each of the Parties interact with B. I am directing some new services to assist in that regard.

## Section 37

[698] Section 37 of the FLA sets out the best interests of children in making parenting arrangements. Determining what is in a child's best interests, including the child's needs and circumstances, requires consideration of:

- a)  the factors in subsection (2);
- b)  ensuring the direction in subsection (3) that an order is not in the best interests of a child unless it protects, to the greatest extent possible, the child's physical, psychological and emotional safety, security and well-being; and
- c)  subsection (4) that, in making an order under this Part, a court may consider a person's conduct only if it substantially affects a factor set out in subsection (2), and only to the extent that it affects that factor.

## (a) the child's health and emotional well-being;

[699] B.'s wide spectrum of mental health disorders are being addressed by Dr. Ambrose. In addition, B.'s ASD diagnosis poses lifelong challenges for which she may have to receive continuing assistance.

[700] B. has an extremely close relationship with S.T.M. that, over time, became enmeshment. That has negatively influenced her relationship with C.G.H., despite Dr. Ambrose's efforts. At the same time, she is estranged from C.G.H. Those two circumstances have adversely affected B.'s emotional wellbeing. C.G.H.'s response was to become more demanding of what he considered 'his time', in part, because he has been and remains skeptical of B.'s OCD and ASD diagnoses.

[701] B.'s modest attempt at self-harm and her recent assertions of suicidal ideations are additional concerns that may require immediate psychiatric intervention if they are genuine and if they persist or increase.

## (b) the child's views, unless it would be inappropriate to consider them;

[702] B. has had the opportunity to provide her views to the Court and the Parties through her counsel. Those views, and the reasons behind them, deserve consideration in arriving at the decisions affecting her future.

[703] I do not agree with C.G.H.'s view that the Court should categorically disregard B.'s views simply because S.T.M. may have influenced her. However, the weight given to B.'s views must be tempered in light of her close relationship with S.T.M. and the impact of ASD on how those views may be formed and expressed.

## (c) the nature and strength of the relationships between the child and significant persons in the child's life;

[704] The evidence is clear that B.'s strongest bond is with S.T.M. B. has a close relationship with S.T.M.'s sister and her family and S.T.M.'s parents. She also has a cordial relationship with C.G.H.'s parents. B. has expressed a positive relationship with T.C. but that relationship is limited by the amount of time B. spends at C.G.H.'s home and T.C.'s absences for professional reasons.

[705] It is clear from B.'s views that she considers her relationship with C.G.H. to be very distant, if not completely shattered. She has repeatedly expressed a number of negative views about C.G.H. and their relationship. Dr. Ambrose has had limited success in addressing those issues with B. because she either cannot or will not explain her reasons for the negativity. B. has given some specific examples of C.G.H. treating her in a negative fashion by criticizing or minimizing her ASD and by calling her a liar.

[706] C.G.H. has denied those allegations but even if he is correct, I am satisfied that the manner in which he speaks to B. is often without sensitivity to how she might receive and respond to that communication. Given C.G.H.'s earlier statements to Dr. Ambrose about not accepting, or questioning, B.'s diagnoses I am concerned that he has not, and perhaps will not, adapt his approach in dealing with B. That accords with

The Reports concerns that C.G.H. is not motivated to changing his attitudes or accepting treatment.

## (d) the history of the child's care;

[707] From the time of B.'s birth until the Parties' separation the relationship between her and S.T.M. was much stronger than her relationship with C.G.H. For the first year of B.'s life S.T.M. was with her full time while C.G.H. worked. Once S.T.M. returned to work, she was the one primarily responsible for transporting B. to and from childcare and she worked during the day while C.G.H. worked shifts as a paramedic.

[708] C.G.H. did participate in caring for B. when he was available but it was not close to an equal division of parenting duties with S.T.M. because he was occupied with his work, union activities and later, his university studies and fieldwork. The fact that S.T.M. and B. formed a very close bond concerned C.G.H. In his meetings with Dr. Aube, he acknowledged that he was frequently unavailable to care for B. in her early years.

[709] After signing the Agreement, S.T.M. maintained her role as the primary caregiver as C.G.H. continued his education and the necessary fieldwork to pursue his professional goals. His assertion that the Parties be considered to have implemented an equal parenting regime is countered by the fact that it did not occur and when it did not occur he did nothing formally to assert his interpretation of the Agreement until S.T.M. commenced litigation over four years later.

## (e) the child's need for stability, given the child's age and stage of development;

[710] All children have a better chance for success if they have stability in their lives. That applies at all times in a child's life and is affected by each child's resilience to the circumstances they encounter. I am satisfied that despite her chronological age, B. often acts and responds like a younger child. I cannot discern whether that is an effect of her enmeshment with S.T.M., her estrangement from C.G.H., her ASD or some combination of some or all of those circumstances.

[711] Overall, I am satisfied that B. presents as someone less mature than some teenagers do. I also conclude, as the experts have all suggested, that she needs a routine that is, as much as possible, consistent, planned and without a lot of spontaneity unless initiated by her.

- (f) the ability of each person who is a guardian or seeks guardianship of the child, or who has or seeks parental responsibilities, parenting time or contact with the child, to exercise his or her responsibilities;

[712] C.G.H.'s request that the Court grant him sole guardianship all parental responsibilities and parenting time in a manner similar to what occurred in M.S.R. cannot prevail. It is not in B.'s best interests. In addition, C.G.H. did not present any witnesses who might have provided a reunification strategy as was done in M.S.R. so there is no evidentiary foundation to grant such an order.

[713] I echo Dr. Aube's observation that both Parties are capable of exercising their guardianship, parental responsibilities and parenting time in B.'s best interests but they both have to abandon their pursuit of proving that they are 'right'. They will receive some Court directed assistance to enhance their capability to move away from those rigid positions to meet B.'s best interests.

- (g) the impact of any family violence on the child's safety, security or well-being, whether the family violence is directed toward the child or another family member;

[714] C.G.H. relies on a finding of parental alienation by S.T.M. as the foundation to his submission that family violence has occurred. Alienation constitutes 'psychological and emotional abuse', falling within the FLA definition of 'family violence' described in C.J.J. and L.D.K. Where family violence is present, Section 38 directs the Court to consider a number of factors.

[715] Alienation is not the same threat as a physical assault on a child. However, its impact can be permanent by undermining the very important child/parent bond. It is a serious harm and represents a pattern of controlling behaviour.

- [716] I do not agree with The Report's conclusion that S.T.M. induced or was responsible for parental alienation. Therefore, there is no family violence to assess and C.G.H.'s request for a protection order is dismissed.
2. (h) whether the actions of a person responsible for family violence indicate that the person may be impaired in his or her ability to care for the child and meet the child's needs;

[717] Not applicable.

- (i) the appropriateness of an arrangement that would require the child's guardians to cooperate on issues affecting the child, including whether requiring cooperation would increase any risks to the safety, security or well-being of the child or other family members;

[718] Both Parties profess a wish for a cooperative relationship in B.'s best interests. Whatever cooperation there may have been in the past has long disappeared. The protracted and acrimonious struggles between the Parties have negatively affected B.'s well-being to the point where restoring that aspect of her life may not be achievable. But, if it is, it will require outside intervention and the Parties cooperation going forward.

- [719] There will orders for third-party assistance and intervention in an attempt to restore cooperation or at least ameliorate the present acrimonious circumstances.
2. (j)  any civil or criminal proceeding relevant to the child's safety, security or wellbeing.

[720] There are no criminal proceedings relevant to B.'s safety, security or well-being. This litigation is very relevant to those issues.

## Parenting Arrangements

[721] The Parties and B. presented the Court with several parenting time proposals over the course of the trial including:

- a)  C.G.H.'s original proposal for equal parenting time;
- b)  C.G.H.'s revised proposal that he be granted all the parenting time with S.T.M. having limited weekend contact for a lengthy period;
- c)  S.T.M.'s proposal, in the course of her evidence, that C.G.H. have three nights parenting time on alternate weekends;
- d)  S.T.M.'s proposal, in the course of counsel submissions, that C.G.H. have five nights of parenting time on alternate weekends with some additional time during vacation periods; and
- e)  B.'s proposal that she only have parenting time with C.G.H. on occasions when they have special activities planned and no, or very limited overnights.

[722] B.'s counsel, in the summary document and in his subsequent submissions, presented her views and her position on a variety of matters. Those representations clearly indicate that B. has great love for and devotion to S.T.M. and a loathing, bordering on hatred, for C.G.H.

[723] I carefully considered B.'s views in determining her best interests, which are my only consideration in decisions of this kind. It is important for B. to understand while she has a voice in what happens in this litigation, she does not have a veto. It is particularly important to note that even S.T.M. does not agree with B.'s parenting time proposal, with C.G.H. describing it as a step backward in the face of progress made to date.

[724] In A.A., the Court of Appeal determined that in assessing the best interests test in Section 37 (2) if the long-term best interests of the child involve a change to the status quo , even where that change could have short-term difficulties, then those changes should be made and failure to do so could amount to an error of law.

[725] Given B.'s ASD and her general resistance to spend even as much time with C.G.H. as she does now, a change in parenting arrangements of the magnitude now sought by C.G.H. would be a negative and catastrophic result for B. Regardless of how circumstances led to her deeply held thoughts about C.G.H., his proposal could cause a dramatic response by B. of monumental proportions. In all the circumstances, C.G.H.'s final parenting arrangements submission is not in B.'s best interests.

[726] During the trial there was a statement attributed to B. that she did not like it when people did not follow the rules. That is a good attitude to have for a successful personal and social life. This litigation requires me to make many decisions to assist or direct the behaviour of the Parties and B. into the future. Those decisions are the rules the Court expects everyone to respect going forward even if they do not agree with them.

[727] Some dated evidence indicates that B.'s maturity may not be completely in line with her chronological age. It is also clear that B. suffers great emotional distress in wrestling with what her decisions should be in the face of her erroneous perceptions that one Party or the other will be angered or upset by the result. She must be relieved of that burden. A parenting schedule is necessary to provide for the preplanning, consistency and routine that all the experts agree will benefit B.

[728] B. must have a voice into the decisions made about her time and activities with each Party. The Parties should listen, and give careful consideration, to her wishes on what will occur during her parenting time with them if they are reasonable and rational.

[729] C.G.H. raised a concern about B.'s unavailability for his parenting time due to her other commitments. This must cease. B. should not be accepting invitations for specific activities during either Parties' parenting time without first conferring with that Party and obtaining permission. Where appropriate, the Parties should encourage and accommodate those events.

[730] B. should be encouraged to participate in organized and on-going activities that both Parties endorse. If there is an agreement that B. should participate in a particular

activity both Parties will share the cost of those activities proportionately in the same fashion as special or extraordinary expenses, and each will be required to take B. to those activities if they occur on their parenting time.

[731] If the Parties cannot agree on B.'s activities each may choose, in consultation with B., one organized activity at a time. They will be fully responsible for the costs of that activity. Both Parties will make best efforts to ensure that B. gets to that activity if it occurs during their parenting time.

[732] The evidence and submissions make it clear that B.'s best interests regarding her parenting time with C.G.H. must include the following:

- a)  It must be predictable, with allowances for special events and occasions;
- b)  It must be consistent with as few last minute changes as possible;
- c)  It must be of sufficient length to foster a real child/parent daily living routine;
- d)  It must take into account B.'s interests and activities;
- e)  It must be designed to eliminate, or greatly reduce, B.'s concurrent interactions with both Parties or their delegates;
- f) It must strengthening her relationship with C.G.H. with the enthusiastic encouragement of S.T.M.;
- g)  It should foster a strengthening of her relationship with T.C.; and
- h)  It must include [omitted for publication] whenever possible.

[733] S.T.M. must address, or at least mask, any anxieties she may have about B.'s parenting time with C.G.H. Based on the strategies she has been working on with Dr. Ambrose she must make herself less available to B. when B. is with C.G.H. She must redouble any efforts she has made in the past to encourage B. to improve her relationship with C.G.H. More joint sessions between B. and C.G.H. with Dr. Ambrose may be beneficial.

[734] S.T.M. must carefully consider B.'s many complaints about C.G.H. with an objective eye and give C.G.H. an opportunity to respond before becoming accusatorial. There were several examples given during the trial where B.'s information to S.T.M. were exaggerations of circumstances or simply not correct. There was insufficient evidence to determine that those occasions were a result of B. being simply untruthful or having misperceptions of events due to her ASD, some combination of those two circumstances or perhaps other reasons but they must be addressed. If they are not, the animosity between the Parties may never diminish, to B.'s detriment.

[735] At present, C.G.H. is not able to communicate effectively with B.  He has not addressed the fears and anxieties that she has around him.  He does not speak to B. about her historical complaints against him.  B. does not feel comfortable enough to share these things with him either.  C.G.H. needs to do a great deal of work to improve the nature and strength of his relationship with B.

[736] He must stop blaming S.T.M. for every negative thing from the past or present between B. and him and actually start implementing the things that the professionals and S.T.M. have shown to be beneficial for B. He says he supports The Report's findings and recommendations but he has put practically no effort into acting on the steps he was advised to take.

[737] Until that happens and B. is comfortable with C.G.H., there should be no changes to increase his parenting time.  Again, the focus must be on what is best for B., not on what C.G.H. would like.

[738] B.'s position of flexible, unscheduled parenting time flies in the face of all the evidence, and both Parties' positions, that a scheduled consistent routine, with as much advance notice as possible about what will occur during the parenting time with each Party, is in her best interests.

[739] In the final analysis B.'s wishes, although firmly held at this point, are not in her best interests. Until the Parties avail themselves, and B, of the further assistance I will

require they participate in, the present parenting time regime will generally remain in place.

[740] S.T.M.'s assertion that B. would function better by being back in her home on Sunday evenings is reasonable. That will allow B. to prepare for the upcoming school week even though she appears to be excelling in school under the present schedule. However, her proposed schedule for C.G.H.'s parenting time going forward is a retrenchment from the present schedule and runs contrary to her repeated assertions that an equal parenting regime is her end goal.

[741] Taking into account B.'s views, the evidence of the Parties and their witnesses, The Report, the experts' evidence, the voluminous case law provided and the extensive submissions the final result is that at this time B's best interests are met by parenting time with C.G.H. remaining much the same as it is now; about five nights in alternate weeks.

[742] There are some genuine issues surrounding B.'s views about the unfortunate and distressing circumstances surrounding her past and present relationship with C.G.H. In light of the Court's rejection of the recommendations of The Report and Dr. Aube's trial evidence, an immediate move to equal parenting time is not now, and depending on the steps taken in the immediate future, may never be in B.'s best interests.

[743] There will be several changes to the present schedule as set out in Appendix A to the Decision. They will commence in the summer of 2023 and continue until early 2025 and include:

- a)  C.G.H. will receive compensatory parenting time in both 2023 and 2024 during the summer school breaks;
- b)  C.G.H.'s regular parenting time will commence on alternate Tuesdays after school until Sunday evening (or Monday evening if there is no school on Monday);

- c)  Christmas school break will be divided such that S.T.M. has parenting time on Christmas Eve, as is her family's tradition and C.G.H. will have parenting time on Christmas Day and New Year's Eve;
- d)  The Parties will share the school spring break;
- e)  S.T.M. will have parenting time with B. on Mother's Day and C.G.H. will have parenting time on Father's Day; and
- f) The Parties must confirm any changes to the parenting time that they agree to in a Consent Order.

## Police Enforcement

[744] In contrast to the history of S.T.M.'s noncompliance with the FCC Order B.'s refusals ceased almost completely after the August 2020 Order, which included a police enforcement clause. C.G.H. seeks to have that clause continue while S.T.M. says it is not necessary.

[745] It is not clear, on the totality of the evidence, whether the end of B.'s refusals was due to the police enforcement clause, a change to the parenting time schedule so that there were fewer exchanges or some combination of the two. The evidence suggests that B. had the misunderstanding that she could simply refuse to spend time with C.G.H. without consequences.

[746] In D.J.S. the Court stated at paragraphs [35] to [38]:

[35] In a new application the mother seeks an order for a police officer assist clause pursuant to s. 231 of the Family Law Act. In his cross-application the father also seeks a police officer assist clause. In her Affidavit #6, the mother deposes at para. 47 [as read in]:

To dispel any uncertainty, especially in the mind of [T.], who is now completely enmeshed in this conflict, I need to be able to tell him that there is an ongoing police enforcement clause in place, and that I will not hesitate to invoke it if necessary. I expect that with [T.] having that knowledge, it is unlikely that police involvement will actually be required.

[36] Considering the provision in the Family Law Act, as with s. 62 of the Family Law Act, I am of the view that the

ordinary meaning of s. 231 forecloses an ongoing police enforcement clause. The section only applies where a person has failed to comply and the court is satisfied that no other order is sufficient to secure their compliance. If the person is not currently failing to comply but may only prospectively fail to comply, it is difficult to see how the court could be satisfied that no other order under the act would be sufficient to secure compliance. There is no compliance to secure, as currently the father is currently compliant.

[37] Second, all of the evidence is that s. 231 is meant to be used only in limited circumstances which is not consistent with a continuous order. The Ministry of Justice in its comments on s. 231 in the Family Law Act Explained says that it allows for the limited use of two extraordinary remedies. These two remedies may only be used when there is no other less severe remedy under the act sufficient to secure compliance. The Ministry notes that where the issue involves wrongfully withholding a child from a guardian, i.e. the situation addressed by s. 231(5), the court can only order police enforcement where the court determines that no other remedy under s. 61 will be sufficient to force compliance. The comments conclude as follows:

Although these extraordinary remedies should not be regularly used, because they have such a negative impact on children, there are rare cases where a court may require them.

[38] In my view, there are good policy reasons why the court should be reluctant to make a continuous police officer assist type of order as is sought by each party. As I have noted, the clause should be limited to extraordinary circumstances such as occurred in the aftermath of the Mexico trip and not routinely. In addition to the harm to children that ongoing police involvement can have, police should not be diverted from their primary responsibilities in law enforcement. For all of these reasons I decline to make a police officer assist order in respect of either party.

[747] There are no present allegations of noncompliance with the Court's order regarding parenting time. Keeping in mind that police enforcement clauses should not become a long-standing court response when lesser penalties for future infractions are

available C.G.H. has not demonstrated that a police enforcement clause in perpetuity is the only available remedy for future allegations of noncompliance. It is not appropriate to extend the police enforcement clause at this time.

[748] There remains the issue of whether or not Section 61 could provide for an imposition of penalties on a prospective basis if future breaches of the Court's orders occur. The decisions in K.R ., D.R., S.G., and D.M.F. clearly determined that such a perspective order is not appropriate.

## Conduct Issues

[749] There are troubling allegations concerning B. receiving information from, being requested to provide to, or in some instances supress information from, the Parties. That must cease immediately. They must be diligent in not involving B. in matters that would cause her distress or engage her in discussions and decisions best left to the adults. However, if B. continues her involvement in future litigation she will be able to obtain information as required by her counsel.

[750] There is evidence from each Party that the other has been 'badmouthing' them to, or undermining their relationship with, B. Aside from alleging some examples, S.T.M. did not seek any sanctions against C.G.H. C.G.H. seeks an order that S.T.M. compensate him, and post a bond for, what he describes as her bad behaviour. However, his evidence did not demonstrate to me that any past actions by S.T.M. were serious enough to attract a Section 228 penalty.

## Parenting Coordinator

[751] Both Parties agreed that they do not communicate effectively and that has a negative impact on B. S.T.M. noted that she and C.G.H. have polar opposite views on many aspects of B.'s parenting. They also agreed that it would benefit B. if there was less conflict in their relationship and where a conflict arises, arrive at a resolution without the protracted time and expense of court proceedings.

[752] There were many examples in the evidence, where the Parties directly contradicted each other concerning:

- a)  Particular events;
- b)  The arrangements concerning their parenting time with B. and lack of adherence to those arrangements;
- c)  Their parenting approaches and styles;
- d)  Their attempts at cooperation in the face of uncooperative behaviours from the other Party; and
- e)  B.'s health issues and how to address them.

[753] In Dr. Aube's opinion, it is essential that the Parties use a parenting coordinator because going back to court is a long, time-consuming process that is hard financially. For a child with special needs, like B., decisions must be made quickly.

[754] C.G.H. said that it would be beneficial to the Parties and to B. to have a parenting coordinator appointed in order to facilitate more rapid and less expensive resolution of future disputes between the Parties.

[755] S.T.M. said that she would rather not have a Parenting Coordinator appointed because she would lose her rights as a mother because the decision-making would come from a Parenting Coordinator and not her. What she ignores is that, due to her differences with C.G.H., her rights as a mother are being interfered with by the Court at this time.

[756] In determining whether a parenting coordinator is appropriate, I must consider the provisions of Sections 14-18 of the FLA. Those considerations were discussed in Fleetwood, where Justice Groberman said at paragraph 48:

[48] The statute does not set out criteria that must be satisfied before a court will order that a parenting coordinator be engaged to 'build consensus' or make determinations. It seems to me that such an order will typically be made only where a judge is convinced that a parenting coordinator will enjoy significant advantages over the court in achieving a

resolution that will benefit the parties and their children. As well, because a parenting coordinator will be paid for by the parties, the court must consider the parents' ability to pay, and the economic costs or savings that the appointment of a parenting coordinator will entail.

[757] This is a highly conflicted case. The underlying animosity the Parties have for each other is evident despite their expressions that they wish to move forward. Future conflict is inevitable if the Parties do not take some substantive steps to be reasonable and cooperative. Rather than resorting to more court proceedings to determine future conflicts a more effective, expeditious and less expensive means, in the short term, is to appoint a parenting coordinator. A parenting coordinator may also be able to assist the Parties to develop healthier communication skills that may allow them to resolve disputes on their own.

[758] A parenting coordinator is privately retained and such costs cannot be ignored. However, those costs would be less than the enormous expense the Parties have incurred in this litigation to date.

[759] Both Parties actions have contributed to the tenor and length of this litigation and they should each bear some costs for the parenting coordinator. Sharing of the costs will be in the same proportion as for the Section 7 CSG expenses, subject to the parenting coordinator's authority to reapportion expenses as set out in the parenting coordination agreement the Parties will be required to sign.

[760] In an effort to give the Parties some control over the appointment of a parenting coordinator including considering their qualifications, experience in dealing with ASD children and the relevant costs, I will permit them a brief period of time to see if they can agree on who should be appointed. If the Parties can agree they can enter into a consent order and have that filed with the Court.

[761] If the Parties are unable to agree they can apply for directions, each can submit a maximum of three proposed names and one will be appointed as determined by the Court.

[762] Any proposed parenting coordinator must be selected from the British Columbia Parenting Coordinators' Roster Society and such appointment will be for a two-year period and in the most current form of generally accepted precedent for a parenting coordination agreement endorsed by the Society.

[763] The parenting coordinator may assist the Parties as described in Sections17 and 18, subject to the provisions of Section 19, of the FLA.

## Family Systems Therapy

[764] Dr. Gamache provided information about FST that she coordinates through the REACH program and how that might assist the Parties. Dr. Ambrose suggested the Parties engage in FST to work on their communication but that was not within her area of practice.

[765] Both of the Parties recognize the value of FST and I agree that such a program would be of great benefit to B. and to them. The holistic and encompassing approach described by Dr. Gamache may be the last and best approach to establish a positive relationship between B. and C.G.H. FST is a truly 'Cadillac' approach and comes with a similar price tag. However, in my view it is a small price to pay in the present circumstances to address B.'s best interests. There is a limited window of time to attempt to improve the interpersonal dynamics of this family.

[766] I have determined that this is the best course of action despite Dr. Aube's concern that neither Party may be amenable to treatment.

[767] C.G.H. is prepared to fund the FST initially. In light of several other orders in this decision that would place an unfair burden on him. Sharing the FST costs will be in the same proportion as the Section 7 CSG expenses.

[768] Like in the case of the parenting coordinator's appointment, the Parties will have the opportunity to cooperate in the appointment a FST team including consideration of their qualifications, experience in dealing with ASD children and the relevant costs. If the Parties can agree they can enter into a consent order and have that filed with the Court.

[769] If the Parties are unable to agree on an FST team they can apply for directions, each can submit a maximum of three proposed names and one will be appointed as determined by the Court.

[770] C.G.H. sought an order that S.T.M. pay for a proportion of Dr. Gamache's fees including her attendance at trial. Although Dr. Gamache was qualified as an expert, she was C.G.H.'s witness and provided him with therapeutic services. It is not appropriate to require S.T.M. to contribute to those expenses.

## Ms. Paxton

[771] Ms. Paxton's evidence provided me with an extremely helpful education in how people with ASD function and respond to situations and circumstances they encounter in their daily lives. She also had some very practical advice on how to assist a person with ASD in navigating in the community and improving interpersonal relationships.

[772] Although there will not be an order directing that B. or the Parties receive counselling with Ms. Paxton, it is open to S.T.M., utilizing her authority to make decisions about B.'s health, to put Dr. Ambrose and Ms. Paxton in contact with each other to see if there are further or different therapeutic approaches that might assist B.

## CPIC Entry

[773] C.G.H. suffered considerable inconvenience, embarrassment and expense arising from the unwarranted inclusion of his name on CPIC regarding firearms. However, despite C.G.H.'s suspicions that S.T.M. was somehow involved, there was insufficient evidence presented to permit any conclusions about who was responsible for that entry.

## Section 61 FLA Issues

[774] S.T.M. and D.H. said that they made real efforts to get B. into the car for the Sunday exchanges. However, it is apparent from the evidence that on many of those occasions:

- a)  They either did not make it clear to B. that they were exercising parental authority by encouraging or even insisting she accompany C.G.H. for his parenting time when they were at the exchange location;
- b)  They did not insist that B. be properly attired for parenting time with C.G.H.; and
- c)  They did not park their vehicle long enough to permit C.G.H. a proper opportunity to engage with and encourage B. to come with him.

[775] Although the Sunday exchanges were uncomfortable for everyone and some of C.G.H.'s behaviours may have been assertive or bordering on aggressive at times, out of his frustration with the situation, the result was he missed many Sunday parenting times.

[776] S.T.M. did make some suggestions to alleviate the refused Sunday parenting time. C.G.H. rejected them but offered no alternatives so he cannot fully attribute all the difficult circumstances to her.

[777] After considering the evidence on this topic, the case law and the provisions of Sections 61 and 62 of the FLA it is clear to me that on many, but not all occasions,

S.T.M.'s actions or inactions denied C.G.H. his parenting time. The denials were unreasonable and meet the Section 61 test.

[778] Not imposing a penalty, as described in R. (K.), is available but that would not be the appropriate judicial response here. C.G.H. wants both 39 days of compensatory parenting time and a $5000 fine against S.T.M. In order to bring home to S.T.M., and perhaps B., that noncompliance with Court orders has consequences, and to provide additional opportunities for C.G.H. to work on improving his relationship with B. I make the following Orders; under Section 61(2):

- a)  S.T.M. will pay to C.G.H. $5000, for the benefit of B., by payment into the Registered Education Savings Plan C.G.H. maintains for B.; and
- b)  C.G.H. will have compensatory parenting time with B. during the 2023 and 2024 summer school breaks as scheduled in Appendix A .

## Legal Fees

[779] It is not sufficient, or appropriate, for a party to present an account for services rendered after the evidence and expect the Court to make findings of fact about it. I agree with S.T.M.'s counsel that C.G.H. did not present the necessary evidentiary foundation to allow me to determine how much, if any, of the claimed legal expenses he should be compensated for under Sections 61, 228 or 230 of the FLA. That claim is dismissed.

## CHILD SUPPORT

## INCOME DETERMINATION

[780] S.T.M.'s Notices of Assessment or tax returns for various years indicate the following Line 15000 incomes including employment and, in some years, rent:

- a)  2016 - $109,373
- b)  2017- $111,198;
- c)  2018 - $113,968;

- d)  2019 - $106,259;
- e)  2020 - $97,306; and
- f) 2021 - $108,798 less union dues of $1579 = $107,219.

[781] S.T.M. received retroactive pay in 2022 for the years 2017 to 2021 in the following gross amounts:

- a)  2017 - $2,648.72;
- b)  2018 - $5,951.84;

- d)  2020 - $13,904.59;
- e)  2021 - $12,736.98;

Total - $45,346.57

[782] In January 2021, S.T.M. began receiving a Veterans Affairs pension (the Pension) of $1,825 per month arising from a workplace related injury. No further information about the Pension was provided. She did not claim the Pension as income on her 2021 tax return.

[783] C.G.H.'s Notices of Assessment or tax returns for various years indicate the following Line 15000 incomes:

- a)  2016 - $106,854 with expenses of $8,827;
- b)  2017 - $88,228 with expenses of $1,589 and including $1,540 in RRSPs;
- c)  2018- $120,015 including $4,868 in RRSPs;
- d)  2019 - $145,051 including $39,000 in RRSPs;
- e)  2020 - $150,835; and
6. f)
7. 2021 - $166,565.

[784] C.G.H. is the sole director and shareholder of [omitted for publication], which he started in 2014 and incorporated on February 3, 2017. Its offices are in Prince George

and it focuses on [omitted for publication] consulting and [omitted for publication] management.

[785] T.C. has no financial interest in [omitted for publication] or [omitted for publication] but she loaned [omitted for publication] operational funds in 2019 and gives advice to C.G.H. from time to time about business related topics. C.G.H., [omitted for publication] and [omitted for publication] have no financial interest in T.C.'s business ventures.

[786] C.G.H. takes a draw from [omitted for publication] every month throughout the year and, at the end of the year, he determines his total income based on [omitted for publication]'s financial circumstances.

[787] [omitted for publication]'s corporate income and retained earnings at its year-end of January 31 in various years was:

- a)  2019 - gross sales $401,114, net income $186,378; retained earnings $49,645;
- b)  2020 - gross sales $923,754, net income $487,462; retained earnings $336,546;
- c)  2021 - gross sales $1,486,070 net income $592,132, retained earnings $721,513; and
- d)  2022 - gross sales of $1, 605,499, net income $183,438, retained earnings $686,339.

[788] In early 2019, C.G.H.'s accountant advised him that [omitted for publication] owed him $134,727, which he could withdraw on a non-taxable basis.

[789] In [omitted for publication]'s Financial Statements, professional fees increased from $17,527 in 2020 to $74,829 in 2021 and to $152,665 in 2022. No explanation was provided for those increases.

[790] C.G.H. said [omitted for publication]'s gross income had been increasing 50% year-over-year for the past several years as his work for his various clients increased. He hopes to expand to different regions of the province to keep the business growing.

[791] Each year [omitted for publication] purchased more trucks and equipment and hired more crews to do the work during the six-month field season when there is no snow on the ground. The other six months are spent preparing reports, invoicing for the work done the previous field season and preparing for the upcoming season. Over the past few years, his crew has grown from 8 to 12 to over 20 during the field season. In 2021, [omitted for publication] purchased two new trucks, both completely financed.

[792] In the year ending January 31, 2021, [omitted for publication] purchased a 2020 Porsche Carrera for C.G.H. because it was a very busy year with a 50% growth in income so he decided to give himself a bonus. He claims a $30,000 vehicle allowance through [omitted for publication].

[793] On August 16, 2019, C.G.H. incorporated [omitted for publication]. He is the sole director and shareholder. [omitted for publication] owns two properties purchased in 2021, one an office for [omitted for publication] which is located at 646 [omitted for publication] Road, Prince George, BC (the '[omitted for publication] Office') a short distance from his home and the other is a townhouse in a resort oriented strata community located at 15-2479 [omitted for publication], BC (the 'Crew House')

[794] The [omitted for publication] Office was purchased for $870,000. [omitted for publication] provided $200,000.00 to [omitted for publication] for the purchase as [omitted for publication]'s main office. A down payment of $192,124.39 was made from 2020 funds. The current mortgage on the [omitted for publication] Office is $692,000 with annual mortgage payments of $37,364.76, utilities of $10,426.68 and property tax and insurance of $13,876.12 for a total of $61,667.56 in 2021. In addition, the [omitted for publication] Office was a renovated to retrofit the property for offices and [omitted for publication] equipment storage at a cost of $125,686.

[795] [omitted for publication] previously used C.G.H.'s home and property for all operations. With [omitted for publication]'s growth, his home no longer had the capacity to hold equipment and staff and C.G.H. determined it was necessary to provide a proper office and storage space for [omitted for publication] to operate efficiently. The [omitted for publication] Office has significant space for employees to finalize reports and store equipment.

[796] The [omitted for publication] Office was originally a home with three bedrooms and five bathrooms. The entirety of the basement was converted into an [omitted for publication] facility in conjunction with UNBC, a local museum and some local First Nations.

[797] The Crew House was purchased in 2021 for $445,000. A down payment of $139,711.67 was made with funds from [omitted for publication]. The current mortgage on the Crew House property is $295,000 with annual mortgage payments of $18,768.00, utilities of $3697.00 and property tax and insurance of $6900 for a total of $29,365 in 2021.

[798] C.G.H. said that the Crew House was for housing employees while completing projects in the area and would save on hotel and restaurant costs. When [omitted for publication] is not using the Crew House, it is available as a rental revenue stream for [omitted for publication].

[799] C.G.H. said that his accountant explained a little bit to him about how assets can be depreciated through [omitted for publication]. When it came to how he set up [omitted for publication] and [omitted for publication] and how he operates them, he has relied on information from other people in the [omitted for publication] field as well as his accountant.

## Submissions

## S.T.M.

## Income

[800] S.T.M. submits that the Court should determine the following under the FLA and CSG regarding child support:

- a)  The income of the Parties;
- b)  The proper amount of retroactive and on going child support;
- c)  Determination of Section 7 of the CSG expenses; and
- d)  The possible impact of Section 9 of the CSG in determining child support.

## [801] She asks the Court to consider the following:

- a)  She filed an Application to Obtain an Order on January 29, 2019, in which she claimed an order for child support retroactive to July 1, 2014. Since the Parties separated, she has had primary care of B;
- b)  Despite the retroactivity claimed in her Application the Court should make retroactive orders back to January 1, 2016;
- c)  C.G.H.'s first child support payment was on June 1, 2019, and since then he has paid $1,113 per month in child support with no further adjustments; and
- d)  The Parties each paid a portion of some of the Section 7 expenses.

## [802] She submits that:

- a)  Her income should be determined on the basis of her [omitted for publication] income which increased due to a recently negotiated retroactive and going forward salary agreement;
- b)  The Pension should not be considered income for the purposes of the CSG as determined by A.L.P.;
- c)  C.G.H.'s income is complicated by the fact that he is the owner and sole shareholder of [omitted for publication] and [omitted for publication] and controls how much he draws as income, takes as benefits and has [omitted for publication] pay for some of his personal expenses so Sections 18 and 19 of the CSG must be considered in determining his income;

- d)  An analysis of those sections by the Courts, particularly as described in Hausman, provides guidelines in determining income for the purposes of the CSG ;
- e)  The Court is permitted to 'lift the corporate veil' to ensure the income received by the paying parent fairly reflects the money available for child support ;
- f) The Court should presume that the corporation's pre-tax income will be available to the shareholder payor for the payment of child support unless compelling evidence is led by the payor to support the conclusion that reinvestment is necessary to sustain the company as a viable enterprise;
- g)  The onus is on the payor to provide the necessary evidence that the corporation's pre-tax income is not available to the payor;
- h)  The Court should not have to ferret out the necessary information from inadequate or incomplete financial disclosure; and
- i) The evidence of the payor must be clear and compelling and must demonstrate that the expenses of the business must be allocated 'honestly and transparently and must be reasonable and for legitimate business purposes, considering all the circumstances.' (see Jadavji)

[803] Based on the factors described in the case law all of [omitted for publication]'s income should all be available for the payment of child support for the following reasons:

- a)  [omitted for publication] has doubled its profits every year since it has been in operation;
- b)  It purchased two properties;
- I. The Crew House for $445,000 in [omitted for publication], a lakeside community near [omitted for publication], even though most of it's work is in northern British Columbia, and
- II. The [omitted for publication] Office for $870,000 with additional expensive renovations;

when all of those funds could have been used for child support;

- c)  In addition to the purchase of the two properties, many of the expenses of [omitted for publication] were not for legitimate business purposes but a personal benefit to C.G.H. including but not limited to:
- I. Large television and washer and dryer located at C.G.H.'s residence;

- II. A sound system;
- III. A 2020 Porsche Carrera;
- IV. Personal use of a business vehicle for him and T.C.;
- V. Use of [omitted for publication] assets for personal purposes including snowmobiles and ATVs;
- d)  While there is no set formula for determining reasonable imputation of additional income, in this case the Court should attribute $15,000 per year to C.G.H. for personal benefit of those expenses.

## Retroactive Support

[804] S.T.M. submits that in determining the issue of retroactivity the principles enunciated in D.B.S. should guide the Court including:

- a)  She shouldered the financial burden for B. with virtually no support from C.G.H. until June 2019;
- b)  B. has unique needs and requires additional expenses for therapies and programs. She paid for more than her share of these Section 7 expenses;
- c)  C.G.H. has always known about his obligation to support B. Support as contemplated in the Agreement. As soon as it was clear that there was no equal parenting arrangement, he had an obligation to provide support for B;
- d)  Once she applied for child support, C.G.H. still significantly underpaid based on his available income;
- e)  C.G.H. has the ability to pay, and has chosen not to. A retroactive award would not cause him any undue hardship and any additional funds would benefit B. which should be the focus of a retroactive award; and
- f) The Court should make an order that C.G.H. pay child support, commensurate with his income, retroactive to January 1, 2016.

## C.G.H.

## Income

[805] C.G.H. submits:

- a)  The Court must resolve some financial issues respecting past and future support for B. as it pertains to S.T.M.'s income. He does not dispute his obligation to pay support and he has fully disclosed all his financial information to enable the Court to make a proper determination of support;
- b)  S.T.M. will receive increased income, including retroactive pay, under the new [omitted for publication] agreement. Her income should be imputed at the retroactive salary rate including overtime, vacation days, lieu days, and the Pension;
- c)  The reason S.T.M. receives the Pension is not clear. There was no evidence that the Pension is treated by S.T.M. in any way other than as money available to support her lifestyle or that the money is needed for medical expenses, home renovations or any ongoing expense; and
- d)  The Pension should be considered as part of her 'conditions, means, needs and other circumstances…' in accordance with Section 9 of CSG. It should be included in her income as means available in calculating the appropriate level of child support as described in Lozinski.

## [806] C.G.H.'s submissions on his income include:

- a)  Sections 18 and 19 of the CSG apply because he is the sole director and shareholder and his income is derived from [omitted for publication]'s dividends;
- b) Quinton, which reviewed many previous decisions on the issue of closely held companies including Hausman, Kowalwich, Bartkowski, Jeffery, and Miller, reiterated the principles to be applied in determining income for a business owner, profession, or partnership owner at paragraph 85:

[85] From these cases, I extract the following principles applicable to this case. First, the Guidelines should be interpreted in light of their stated objectives, including the ability to calculate child support in an objective manner that ensures consistent treatment of spouses and children who are in similar circumstances. Second, under a s. 18 approach, the corporate income method is likely to be the fairer method of determining income of an individual who wholly controls a corporation. This method allows a court to include all income available for child support an intact family would utilize. Third, where that approach is appropriate, pre-tax corporate earnings, not retained

earnings or earnings after payment of taxes, are the starting point for an assessment of Guidelines income. Fourth, where a company is wholly owned by the payor, the onus is on the payor to provide evidence that his pre-tax corporate earnings are not available to him;

- c)  This does not mean however, that the nominal value of the corporation can be applied to the pre-tax income of the payor. The Court must examine the legitimate needs of [omitted for publication]. Monies retained by the business for the purposes of fiscal responsibility are not included in the calculation of income for support;
- d)  It is unrealistic to base the income of the payor solely on what the he decided to draw from the business. The examination must be on what the payor could have reasonably been expected to draw without harming the financial capabilities of the company;
- e)  Principal mortgage payments can be deemed legitimate corporate needs to maintain the success of the business. Real estate ventures can be considered working capital which was deemed sufficient to be unavailable as pre-tax income; and
- f) He has demonstrated the constraints around the pre-tax corporate income that continue to restrict his dividends since 2018. He has demonstrated that his actions were reasonable, honest, and transparent given the business circumstances. The Court will not second-guess bona fide business decisions.

[807] In order to understand how his [omitted for publication] salary is determined it is necessary to consider the following:

- a)  [omitted for publication]'s clients are 95% forestry contracts in the northern, interior and Shuswap areas of the province. Field work can only be conducted during snow-free months; a maximum of 6 months per year;
- b)  During the field months, additional staff are hired to handle the increased workload while he maintains the office and manages all calls, negotiations, scheduling matters and other duties. [omitted for publication] pays the [omitted for publication] Office expenses as well as, internet, satellite communications, five computer stations and maintenance;
- c)  In the winter months, crews prepare final project reports for each client. [omitted for publication] does not invoice clients until they receive their final reports, which typically begins in the fall and goes into the winter

months. Therefore, it pays for all expenses during the field work months from the previous year's income;

- d)  In addition to the field season expenses [omitted for publication] is required to place a deposit of 10% of the value for bids on government contracts which in 2021 was $60,000;
- e)  [omitted for publication]'s economic outlook requires a conservative approach. Government policy decisions, weather and pandemic related reasons can impact the economic conditions of [omitted for publication]. Like in M.(E.M.) it is necessary to prepare for the fluctuations and those decisions should not be second guessed;
- f) To supplement past increased operating costs, he used RRSPs and personal loans to keep [omitted for publication] afloat and to provide a personal and fiscally successful life for his family;
- g)  In 2019, [omitted for publication] had a net income of $185,046. The dividends allocated to him were $135, 000. This left $49,645 for operating costs. Given the structure of the business, he took out the maximum amount possible without risking his fiduciary duty to [omitted for publication];
- h)  As described in Chekowski, Vincent and Bouzane he must retain a majority of the revenue earned from the previous year to keep [omitted for publication] afloat during the summer months. Anything less would be imprudent and irresponsible. Equipment and vehicle expenditures are considered legitimate business expenses including the washer and dryer used to clean the equipment and uniforms of employees;
- i) Snow machines and ATVs are essential to managing employees' winter and summer working conditions. Most of [omitted for publication]'s work areas require ATVs to access the work sites. He provided a transparent financial statement on all expenses for equipment and vehicles to reflect his increase in workload such as the two trucks purchased in 2021 for $125,685;
- j) He uses the Porsche to meet with prospective clients and government officials to secure contracts. He is unable to use [omitted for publication] trucks as they are used specifically for fieldwork. An allocation of $30,000 accounts for his fuel, mileage, and insurance for matters involving [omitted for publication];
- k)  The [omitted for publication] Office is an essential asset for [omitted for publication] and one that a reasonable business owner would take. [Omitted for publication] was previously using his home for office operations. With [omitted for publication]'s growing success, it no longer had the capacity to hold equipment and staff. It was necessary to provide a proper office space for [omitted for publication] to operate

efficiently. The [omitted for publication] Office allows significant space for employees to finalize reports, store equipment, and helps separate his business and personal life;

- l) The Crew House is for [omitted for publication] employee housing while completing projects in the area, saving on hotel and restaurant expenses. This purchase displays his fiscal responsibility on behalf of [omitted for publication] and serves its ongoing success;
- m) In Isacson, the Court stated, 'Section 18 of the Guidelines is not intended to be a tool for the Court to second guess the bona fide business decisions of a corporation. The purchase of land and equipment, the funding of the company's working capital and the intercorporate payments and other adjustments it made were '[l]egitimate and prudent business decisions pursuant to valid corporate objectives necessary for the ongoing success of the company.' In Richardson, real estate investments including the expenses for those ventures were deemed working capital which were exempt from the payor's pre-tax income;
- n)  The use of Section 18 of the CSG would be unreasonable based on the extensive expenses that [omitted for publication] continues to maintain each year. [Omitted for publication], with money from [omitted for publication], has total mortgages of $987,000. He is unable to increase his dividends is due to those mortgages. Klann, CJL and McKenzie all confirmed that principal debt reduction payments made on mortgages are legitimate corporate expenditures and are not available for support purposes. It would be fiscally irresponsible to draw funds from [omitted for publication] to increase his dividends while it retains a two substantial mortgages;
- o)  In summary, accounting for the various deductions for 2021, [omitted for publication] is left in a deficit of $19,391 further limiting the amount of money available for him to draw from his dividends. In 2020, [omitted for publication] had a deficit of $9604. The deductions of 2020 were predominately for the purchases of the [omitted for publication] Office and the Crew House. Real estate ventures and their corresponding expenses has limited the working capital remaining after deductions that would be available for support purposes; and
- p)  His income under section 16 of the CSG should be his Line 15000 income. As described in Schedule 3 of the CSG his imputed income should be his taxable dividend amount in comparison to Line 15000. The Line 15000 earnings are not a true reflection of his earnings as they are grossed by 25%.

## Retroactive Support

## [808] C.G.H.'s submissions on retroactive support include:

- a)  He was operating under the terms of the Agreement in paying for ongoing expenses for B. and he continuously attempted to obtain his parenting time with B. as provided for in the Agreement;
- b)  He should not be penalized now for attempting to operate within the terms of the Agreement;
- c)  Any finding of retroactive support would pose a considerable hardship on him given the financial situation of [omitted for publication] and [omitted for publication]; and
- d)  S.T.M.'s denial of parenting and interference in altering his parenting arrangements has harmed B. S.T.M. should not be compensated for that behaviour.

## [809] C.G.H. asks the Court to make the following orders:

- a)  For as long as B. is eligible to receive child support, the Parties will exchange: (a) copies of their respective income tax returns for the previous year, including all attachments, not later than June 30 th  each year; and (b) copies of any Notice of Assessment or Reassessment provided to them by Canada Revenue Agency, immediately upon receipt.
- b)  That C.G.H.'s guideline income for support purposes is as follows:
- I. 2016 - $106,854
- II. 2017 - $88,228
- III. 2018 - $120,015 (Reassessment in 2018)
- IV. 2019 - $121,225
- V. 2020 - $149,014
- VI. 2021 - unknown
- c)  S.T.M.'s income be imputed at a minimum of $112,150 for 2021, subject to additions for overtime, on-call pay, and the value of unused vacation time;
- d)  S.T.M.'s historical income be calculated in accordance with the revised RCMP regular member annual rates of pay;
- e)  In addition to her regular income, S.T.M.'s Veteran's Affairs Pension be included in the means available to her in calculating her CSG income; and

- f) Pursuant to Section 7 of the CSG that the Parties, in proportion to their respective incomes, share all expenses for counselling, expert reports, expert testimony and, special and extraordinary expenses.

## Discussion

## Income

[810] S.T.M.'s retroactive pay must be addressed to determine her income, particularly as it pertains to Section 7 of the CSG and the proportionate sharing of those expenses. Unlike many cases, involving retroactive pay awards where the monies are lumped into one payment, S.T.M.'s retroactive pay is in specific amounts attributed to individual years.

[811] If the retroactive income is considered only in 2022 then S.T.M. will pay a greater proportion of the Section 7 expenses in that year then she otherwise would. What is unknown at this point is what those expenses are. On the other hand using that approach would leave C.G.H. paying a greater proportion of the Section 7 expenses in previous years than he would have had S.T.M. been receiving the income she was entitled under the subsequently settled contract.

[812] There is a dearth of case law on point so consideration of a number of sections of the CSG including 7, 16 and 17 as well as the direction about retroactive income and corresponding support obligations described in D.B.S. is required. In the end, the issue is best resolved based on a 'fair and reasonable' result for both Parties. Since the Section 7 expenses were paid as they arose and what is now required is a calculation of the proper proportions between the Parties and an accounting. Considering those factors the 'fair and reasonable' result is that S.T.M.'s retroactive pay be allocated as income for the individual years corresponding to the calculated amounts.

[813] This will require a commensurate reduction in S.T.M.'s 2022 income equal to the gross retroactive pay amounts when the Parties address child support issues going forward.

[814] S.T.M. did not provide details of the Pension making the analysis of that issue more challenging than it needed to be. The cases counsel submitted show two lines of authority, as detailed in A.L.P. and Lozinski, on whether or not the Pension is income for CSG purposes.

[815] There does seem to be some consensus that a determination is best left to the individual nature of each case. The analysis in Lozinski dealt with the wording 'conditions, means, needs and other circumstances' in Section 9 (c) of the CSG in a shared parenting context and not a determination of income. The Court of Appeal noted in paragraph [32]:

[32]…Whether VA disability pensions may be considered Guidelines income is an important issue, but it is not directly engaged because, as discussed below, given the shared parenting context, the Judge was entitled to consider nonincomes and resources. That is how he approach the VA Pension. In addition, Ms. Lozinski did not seek its inclusion in income, nor did the Judge make the order on that basis. In these circumstances, I would leave the comprehensive analysis and determination of whether VA disability pensions may be considered Guidelines income for support purposes to another day.

[816] In A.L.P., the Court considered various lines of authority in British Columbia and elsewhere on whether or not a nonpecuniary pension is income for the purposes of the CSG. The Court determined that previous cases from the British Columbia courts determined that the law in this province is that such payments are not income. On that basis, relying on A.L.P ., the Pension is not income for the purpose of calculating S.T.M.'s CSG income for the Section 7 analysis. The implications of Section 9 of the CSG is dealt with later.

[817] In light of that determination S.T.M.'s income for the years 2016 through 2021 will be imputed to be the total of her Notice of Assessment income plus the retroactive pay for the applicable year resulting in:

- a)  2016 - $109,373
- b)  2017 - $113,847
- c)  2018 - $119,920
- d)  2019 - $116,363
- e)  2020 - $111,250
- f) 2021 - $119,956

[818] Determination of C.G.H.'s income in various years is more complicated given his ownership of [omitted for publication] and [omitted for publication]. The business decisions he made over the years, may be perfectly legitimate from an Income Tax Act perspective, but not necessarily for calculating his CSG income.

[819] The case law provides extensive guidance on how to assess his available income for child support purposes. When considering all those cases as well as others not directly referred to by counsel the final decision must be based on common sense and what an objective, properly informed parent would do regarding child support considering the CSG , the case law, circumstances of [omitted for publication] and [omitted for publication] and the continuing obligation of both Parties to support B.

[820] In many cases where a spouse earns income through a closely held corporation the calculation of that spouse's available income for child support purposes is presented through an expert or an expert's report. A recent example of this is Kargi-Fluckiger where an expert was retained to present scenarios concerning the payor's available income depending on certain business decisions. C.G.H. chose not to do so but did confirm that he had some discussions with his accountant prior to making final business decisions. That leaves the Court in the position of imputing income without any professional expert assistance.

[821] The case law is clear on how to determine a closely held corporation's principal's income. S.T.M.'s submissions on the imputation of income to C.G.H. are fanciful, unrealistic and in many instances do not adopt the directions described in Hausman

C.M., D.M.B., Vincent, Cooke and Quinton . C.G.H. should not have to strip every dollar out of [omitted for publication] and [omitted for publication] each year to pay child support.

[822] As pointed out in Quinton, four principles apply and there is a positive duty on C.G.H. to explain why he cannot avail himself of further draws on his shareholder's loans, [omitted for publication]'s retained earnings or its net income. He did not meet that onus leaving the Court to impute an income based on the evidence of the [omitted for publication]'s fortunes for the years at issue.

[823] [Omitted for publication] purchased a Porsche for C.G.H. Counsel said it was necessary for him to attend meetings with clients. Neither C.G.H. nor his counsel provided any substantive reason as to why he could not have simply purchased an additional pickup truck, at a lower cost, which would allow him not only to meet with clients but also to go into the field, in remote locations, when supervision of field staff was necessary.

[824] C.G.H.'s indulgence with regard to the Porsche is similar to the facts in KargiFluckiger. In that case, the Court determined that such behaviour was not consistent with the appropriate allocation of corporate income between business, family and personal purposes.

[825] In Kargi-Fluckiger, the Court adjusted the payor's available income by rejecting some of the business decisions and arrived at an imputed income based on that analysis. In paragraph [89] the Court said:

[89] This is not a matter of 'second-guessing' Mr. Fluckiger's business decision, but rather of assessing the fairness of the decision on all the evidence to avoid an unjustified imbalance between business and family interests.

[826] A similar evaluation of the fairness of C.G.H.'s business decisions must be undertaken. In doing so the following are important to consider:

- a)  The purchase of the Crew House was not supported by any evidence about previous expenditures [omitted for publication] made for crew accommodations in the area and if that amount was greater than what [omitted for publication] and [omitted for publication] spent in making that capital purchase. Furthermore, he did not provide any evidence of what, if any, rental income was, or could, be collected during the over six months of the year no fieldwork was being done in the area;
- b)  The circumstances surrounding the purchase of the Porsche;
- c)  No explanation of the almost exponential increase in [omitted for publication]'s professional fees year over year;
- d)  The lack of explanation on how income from [omitted for publication] was allocated rather than drawing down his shareholder's loan on a tax-free basis as noted by his accountant; and
- e)  The submission that the acquisition of the two pickup trucks were a cash purchase which diminished available money for his income when the documentation indicates they were fully financed.

[827] In light of those factors, it is necessary to analyse the potential personal income available to C.G.H. while recognizing that [omitted for publication] must retain sufficient cash reserves to meet its obligations. When that is done the imputed incomes for C.G.H. in the years at issue are determined as:

- a)  2016 - $106,854
- b)  2017 - $88,228
- c)  2018 - $120,015
- d)  2019 - $165,000
- e)  2020 - $175,000
- f) 2021 - $200,000
- g)  2022 - $200,000 (estimate)

[828] Based on those incomes the regular monthly child support payable under the CSG would be:

- a)  2016 - $978
- b)  2017 - $820

- c)  2018 - $1113
- d)  2019 - $1473
- e)  2020 - $1551
- f) 2021 - $1746
- g)  2022 - $1746

[829] C.G.H. began making regular monthly child support payments on June 1, 2019, of $1,113 per month. Based on that his regular monthly child support for the years claimed by S.T.M. is:

- a)  2016 - $978 x 12 = $11,736;
- b)  2017 - $820 x 12 = $9840;
- c)  2018 - $1113 x 12 = $13,356;
- d)  2019 - $1473 x 12 = $17,676 less ($1113 x 7 = $7791) = $9885;
- e)  2020 - $1551 x 12 = $18,612 less ($1113 x 12 = $13,356) = $5256;
- f) 2021 - $1746 x 12 = $20,952 less( $1113 x 12 = $13,356) = $7596;
- g)  2022 - $1746 x 12 = $20,952 less( $1113 x 12 = $13,356) = $7596;

for a total of $65,265 as at December 31, 2022; subject to further accounting of credits and debits determined on other issues raised by the Parties.

[830] It will also be necessary to determine the 2022 incomes for the Parties and make any necessary further adjustments.

## Retroactive Support

[831] S.T.M.'s claim for retroactive child support to January 1, 2016, falls within the timeframe described by the Supreme Court of Canada in D.B.S. and the provisions of Section 152 (2) (b) of the FLA.

[832] D.B.S. described the core principles governing retroactive child support claims as:

- a)  Support is the right of the child;
- b)  The amount of support will be based on the income of the payor;
- c)  Retroactive awards are not really retroactive but hold the payor to the legal obligation to pay support commensurate with their income;
- d)  Retroactive awards are not confined to 'exceptional circumstances' or 'rare cases'; and
- e)  The payor's interest in certainty must be balanced with the need for fairness and flexibility.

## [833] Some other factors considered in D.B.S. include:

- a)  The circumstances surrounding the delay in making an Application;
- b)  The payor's conduct;
- c)  The child's circumstances;
- d)  Any hardship caused by a retroactive award; and
- e)  How far back in time a retroactive award should go.

[834] In considering the circumstances surrounding delay, the Court concluded that a delay would be prejudicial if it is deemed to be "unreasonable" taking into account a generous appreciation of the social context in which the claimant seeking child support was made.

[835] The issue of a payor's behaviour was discussed in D.B.S. with an expansive view of what constitutes blameworthy conduct as anything that privileges the payor's own interest over the child's right to an appropriate amount of support.

[836] In determining the child's circumstances, the Court must consider the past and present. The payor's responsibility does not disappear if the child is not in need of financial support, but there must be evidence that the recipient parent was not able to provide adequately for the child to ensure that a retroactive support order does not become a financial windfall.

[837] The Court must consider all the circumstances and make an award that minimizes the hardship to the payor while ensuring not to cause hardship to the child or providing a windfall to the recipient parent.

[838] The date for a retroactive award should be the date on which the payor received effective notice. This does not necessarily require the commencement of legal proceedings. D.B.S. determined that it is usually inappropriate to make a support award retroactive to more than three years before notice was given.

[839] After considering all the evidence, submissions, and the case law, it is appropriate that the commencement date for child support obligations be January 1, 2016, for the following reasons:

- a)  Although C.G.H. has been faithful in his payments since 2019 which somewhat reduces his moral blameworthiness he has not utilized his improved financial circumstances to benefit B.;
- b)  He was well aware for several years that S.T.M. was seeking increased child support which was formalized in her Application filed in January 2019;
- c)  Until monthly child support payments commenced S.T.M. struggled to meet all of B.'s day-to-day needs and a good portion of her additional expenses with very little assistance from C.G.H.; and
- d)  The structure of how and for what reason the retroactive amounts will be paid will alleviate any hardship on C.G.H. while at the same time not providing a windfall to S.T.M.

## Specific CSG Support Issues

## Section 7 Special and Extraordinary Expenses

[840] After the separation, C.G.H. paid no regular monthly child support. Under the terms of the Agreement, each of the Parties were to pay 50% of any special or extraordinary expenses. S.T.M. set up a joint account into which each of the Parties put money to pay for those expenses. At first, there was no set amount but starting in spring 2018, C.G.H. began putting $300 per month into the account.

[841] C.G.H. said it was only after S.T.M. served him with the Application that she asked for additional money, which had never been an issue in the past. Prior to that, he had been providing $300 per month to a joint account and had paid additional sums of money as requested by S.T.M. for such things as B.'s counselling with Ms. Butler and Dr. Ambrose.

[842] S.T.M. exhibited a book of receipts and a spreadsheet detailing her expenditures for the years 2016 through 2020 she claims as special or extraordinary expenses. She said despite her requests for contribution C.G.H. paid nothing for B.'s special or extraordinary expenses or tutoring throughout 2019 and only started paying 50% for extraordinary expenses and B.'s tutoring in October 2020.

[843] S.T.M. said the special and extraordinary expenses included:

- a)  French and English tutoring;
- b)  Counselling with Ms. Butler and Dr. Ambrose;
- c)  Medical and dental care;
- d)  A babysitting course and summer camps; and
- e)  Dr. Rocha's report.
- [844] The total expenditures for those expenses in each year were:
- a)  2016 - $3912;
- b)  2017 - $5898;
- c)  2018 - $4629;
- d)  2019 - $4147;
- e)  2020 - $1645.

[845] C.G.H. provided documentation of various transfers made between his account and the joint account for a net amount to the joint account between 2015 and 2019 totalling:

- a)  2015 - $1110;
- b)  2016 - $1300;

2023 BCPC 110 (CanLII)

- c)  2017 - $4035;
- d)  2018 - $5274;
- e)  2019 - $1800.

[846] He also provided a table of other expenses he made for B. between 2015 and 2020 including clothing, activity expenses, counselling sessions with Dr. Ambrose and Dr. Gamache, The Report and the cost of having Dr. Aube and Dr. Gamache attend at the trial. He claimed his contribution to various expenses were:

- a)  2015 - $1235;
- b)  2016 - $1350;
- c)  2017 - $4505;
- d)  2018 - $6369;

e)  2019 - $24,070;

- f) 2020 - $28,877.

## [847] Which included the following:

- a)  Dr. Rocha's report - $1950;
- b)  Dr. Ambrose's fees from 2019 to the present - $4100;
- c)  Dr. Gamache's counselling and trial attendance - $6900;
- d)  The Report and Dr. Aube's trial attendance - $25,800;
- e)  B.'s piano - $7,583;
- f) B.'s electronics and activities - $4,128; and
- g)  RESP payments for B. from 2015 to the present - $21,537.82.

[848] From July 2019 to the present, C.G.H. has paid child support of $1,113 per month for B. without any adjustments to reflect any changes in C.G.H.'s income.

## Submissions

## S.T.M.

[849] S.T.M.'s counsel submits that she be reimbursed for some of the Section 7 expenses she has incurred based on the criteria set out in that section and described in Clarke.

## [850] He asked the Court to note the following:

- a)  From 2016 to August 2017, C.G.H.'s contributions for Section 7 expenses were sporadic until he started making regular payments of $300 per month, deposited into a joint account. C.G.H. said he considered the payment to be for Section 7 expenses and child support;
- b)  In April 2019, S.T.M. closed the joint account and requested that C.G.H. pay for his proportionate share of Section 7 expenses through e-transfer. C.G.H. made a couple of payments, but stopped paying any Section 7 expenses to S.T.M. after July 2019. S.T.M. continued to email C.G.H. and provide him with receipts and request that he pay his proportionate share but he has not done so; and
- c)  C.G.H. provided a list of 'major expenses' that he has paid. Of that list, the only Section 7 expenses are payments made to Ms. Butler, Dr. Ambrose, and for Dr. Rocha's report.

## [851] S.T.M. submits that:

- a)  The following expenses should be considered special or extraordinary and the Parties should be responsible for their proportionate share according to their incomes;
- I. French and English tutoring;
- II. Counselling with Ms. Butler and Dr. Ambrose;
- III. Medical and dental care;
- IV. A babysitting course and summer camps; and
- V. Dr. Rocha's report.
- b)  Since the Court does not have all of the information for the expenses paid in 2021, it should order that the Parties pay their proportionate share of Section 7 expenses, on proof that a Party has incurred that expense.

## [852] S.T.M. submits the following expenditures by C.G.H. are not Section 7 expenses:

- a)  The  i Pads - As described in Clarke , "a home computer and other similar technologies  do not qualify as extraordinary  as they are "common items found in most homes''.  B. uses the iPads as a computer  and a communication device to contact her friends  and family.  S.T.M. has also purchased  electronics and other aids to help B. with her school;
- b)  The Piano - The cost of an expense must be reasonable, as measured against the combined financial means of the Parties as well as the spending patterns prior to separation. There were no advance discussion regarding such a large purchase and cheaper options should have been considered before requiring S.T.M. to contribute to such an expense;
- c)  Dr. Gamache - No evidence was provided of the type of counselling engaged in and in which B. did not participate. There is no legal basis in which a Party's expert witness trial attendance can be considered a special or extraordinary expense;
- d)  The Report and Dr. Aube - When Dr. Aube was retained, it was agreed that S.T.M. would pay a maximum of $3,000 and C.G.H. would cover any amount over that. C.G.H. confirmed that arrangement in his trial evidence;
- e)  Extra-curricular equipment - Recreational  s p o r t s  and other similar activities, which are important for B. to be involved in, were considered in Clarke to be ordinary expenses of the "average child". The same is true of one-time activities paid for by C.G.H. They are ordinary expected costs to raising children; and
- f) The RESP contributions made by C.G.H. as described in Pereverzoff.

## C.G.H.

## [853] C.G.H.'s submissions regarding Section 7 expenses include:

- a)  He seeks reimbursement for numerous Section 7 expenses incurred and seeks to clarify S.T.M.'s Section 7 submissions.
- b) Kase confirms that the list of special and extraordinary expenses can be exhaustive and the onus is on the parent seeking the expense to prove that it falls under Section 7;
- c) Clarke established that expenses must be both 'necessary' as defined in relation to the child's best interests and 'reasonable,' as measured against the combined financial means of the parents. In addition if the expense is one listed under subsection (d) or (f) educational programs

or extracurricular activities the party claiming the expense must prove that they are 'extraordinary;

- d)  In 2014 and 2015, the Parties agreed to share expenses for matters such as lessons and tutoring. Payment arrangements alternated each week. For the 2016 tax year, S.T.M. and C.G.H. agreed to share the child tax credit as they had an equal parenting arrangement;
- e)  Outside of his child support obligations, starting in 2016, C.G.H., provided S.T.M. with $300 per month to cover additional expenses based on the 50% proportional share agreed upon in the Agreement;
- f) Up until August 2019, when the FCC Order was pronounced, child support payments between the Parties should be calculated based on a shared parenting arrangements;
- g)  Contrary to S.T.M. position that he unilaterally reduced his payments, and ignored his parental obligation, he operated under the terms of the Agreement. He requested the agreed upon equal parenting time with B. to fulfill his responsibility to B. and to participate in an active role in her life;
- h)  He has continued to try to implement his parenting time with B. by following all of the recommendations of professionals and the Court's orders. S.T.M.'s interference and denial of parenting arrangements has harmed B. and should not be endorsed with compensation;
- i) Given the animosity between the Parties, he decided to concentrate on resolving the important parenting time issues and leave the Section 7 expenses for trial. He will abide by the Court's order regarding any outstanding Section 7 expenses; and
- j) He agrees with the following Section 7 expenses incurred by S.T.M.:
- I. French and English tutoring;
- II. Counselling with Ms. Butler and Dr. Ambrose;
- III. Medical and dental care;
- IV. A babysitting course and summer camps.

[854] C.G.H. submits that the follow expenditures made by him are Section 7 expenses:

- a)  Two iPads for B. at a total cost of $1300.00. They are a necessary and essential tool for B.'s education and personal health as described in Gardom;

- b)  A piano for B. for $7,583.39. It helps assist in her lessons and requires strong mathematical skills, which will assist her in school;
- c)  Sessions with Dr. Gamache, cost of $3150 and her appearance at trial cost of $2400 for a total cost of $5550. Those expenditures were made based on the guidance given by the Court in the August 2020 Order. C.G.H. sought professional guidance from Dr. Gamache which improved his relationship with B. Dr. Gamache's evidence at trial helped educated both the Parties and the Court and serves the best interests of the B.;
- d)  The Report cost $18,800 of which S.T.M. only paid $3,000 and the cost of Dr. Aube appearance at trial of $10,000. S.T.M. wanted The Report completed. Dr. Aube provided professional impartial guidance on how the Parties can manage their relationship and help improve his relationship with B. The Report was to assist the Parties and the Court and the recommendations are in accordance with Dr. Ambrose's therapy sessions which are a mutually agreed upon Section 7 expense;
- e)  Based on the decisions in JC and Mclean the following recreational expenses:
- I. Rock Climbing Harness and Shoes - $375;
- II. Downhill Skis and Clothing - $1,345.30;
- III. Dance Shoes for Recital - $68.25;
- IV. Bicycle - $666.75;
- V. Paddle Board -$1,749.00; and
- VI. Life Jackets - $111.89.

because they contribute to B.'s health and well-being and given her ASD, they assist in alleviating her anxiety by providing her an opportunity to build new skills.

## DISCUSSION

## Section 7 Special and Extraordinary Expenses

[855] Both of the Parties have made claims that several of the expenditures they have made for B. over the years are special or extraordinary expenses. Based on the plain reading of Section 7 of the CSG and considering the case law only some of the expenditures each has made qualify as special or extraordinary expenses.

- [856] A claim for special or extraordinary expenses can be rejected for a variety of reasons including that:
- a)  They are what is considered to be an ordinary expense of raising a child;
- b)  They were made without consultation with the other Party in circumstances where such consultation is appropriate in light of the Parties' circumstances; and
- c)  Even if an expense is special or extraordinary, its necessity and reasonableness in light of the Parties' means and pre separation spending patterns must be considered.
- [857] Even though some of the claimed special or extraordinary expenses do not qualify under Section 7, they may be expenses that should be shared between the Parties for other reasons.
- [858] In determining what are non-qualifying expenses, S.T.M.'s cases and submissions are persuasive and largely accepted.
- [859] The non-qualifying expenses under Section 7 claimed by S.T.M. include:
- a)  Piano Lessons;
- b)  Yoga;
- c)  Swimming Lessons; and
- d)  Dance Lessons.
- [860] The non-qualifying expenses under Section 7 claimed by C.G.H. include:
- a)  iPads;
- b)  Piano;
- c)  Dr. Gamache's counselling of C.G.H. and the costs of her attending trial;
- d)  The Report and the costs of Dr. Aube attending trial;
- e)  Rock Climbing Harness and Shoes;
- f) Downhill Skis and Clothing;

- g)  Dance Shoes for Recital;
- h)  Bicycle;
- i) Paddle Board; and
- j) Life Jackets.

[861] The Agreement provided that the Parties would nominally equally share the special or extraordinary expenses subject to a reallocation if one party's income exceeded the others by a substantial amount.

- [862] Based on the conflicting documentation presented the total of special and extraordinary expenses for each of the years was:
- a)  2016 - $3,912;
- b)  2017 - $5,679;
- c)  2018 - $4,629;
- d)  2019 - $5,085;
- e)  2020 - $6,295;
- f) 2021 - $6,350 (Dr. Ambrose only);
- g)  2022 - no information.
- [863] From the conflicting documentation the total amount contributed by C.G.H. for each year was:
- a)  2016 - $1,350;
- b)  2017 - $4,005;
- c)  2018 - $4,274;
- d)  2019 - $1,872;
- e)  2020 - $4,650;
- f) 2021 - $3,763;
- g)  2022 - no information.

[864] For the purposes of calculating the Parties proportional share of the Section 7 expenses, it is more appropriate to utilize S.T.M.'s recalculated retroactive salary for the years in question. Those were the years in which the expenditures occurred.

[865] The Parties' incomes and their proportionate share of Section 7 expenses for the years in question are:

- a)  2016 - S.T.M. $109,373 (51%), C.G.H. $106,854 (49%);
- b)  2017 - S.T.M. $113,847 (56%), C.G.H. $88,228 (44%);
- c)  2018 - S.T.M. $119,920 (50%), C.G.H. $120,015 (50%);
- d)  2019 - S.T.M. $116,363 (41%), C.G.H. $165,000 (59%);
- e)  2020 - S.T.M. $111,250 (39%), C.G.H. $175,000 (61%);
- f) 2021 - S.T.M. $119,956 (37%), C.G.H. $200,000 (63%);

[866] Based on the percentages above the accounting for the amounts C.G.H. should have contributed and what he did contribute in each year and any deficits or credits are:

- a)  2016 - $3,912 x 49% = $1,917 - $1,350 = - $567;
- b)  2017 - $5,679 x 44% = $2,499 - $4,005 = + $1,506 ;
- c)  2018 - $4,629 x 50% = $2315 - $4,274 = + $1,959;
- d)  2019 - $5,085 x 59% = $3,000 - $1,872 = - $1,128;
- e)  2020 - $6,295 x 61% = $3,840 - $4,650 = + $810;
- f) 2021 - $6,350 x 63% = $4,000 - $3,763 = - $273.

[867] These calculations take into account the amounts paid by each Party, the payment to Dr. Rocha, the amounts paid to Dr. Ambrose and other health related expenses for B. paid from S.T.M.'s health benefits, which leaves C.G.H. with a net overpayment of $2,343 as at December 31, 2021.

## Section 9 Shared Parenting

## S.T.M.

## [868] S.T.M. submits:

- a)  The Parties have never had shared parenting time with B. At all times, she had more than 60% of the parenting time with B. In the situation, C.G.H. has parenting time with B. of approximately 37% of the time and as such Section 9 does not apply at present;
- b)   C.G.H.'s submission that the Parties had an equal parenting arrangement pursuant to the Agreement for the purposes of child support is contrary to actual parenting time he enjoyed; and
- c)  A shared parenting arrangement, described in Section 9 of the CSG , does not come into play until each guardian has "not less than 40% of parenting time". Child support must only be determined based on the actual parenting arrangements of the Parties.

[869] If the Court determines that the parenting time arrangements going forward would require the application of Section 9 because the 40% parenting time threshold is met it should be guided by the principles described in Contino as reviewed in the recent decision of M.M.L.

[870] Contino instructs that when considering child support under Section 9 there is no need to separate out special or extraordinary expenses or resort to the undue hardships provisions. Section 9 (c) confers a broad discretion to take into consideration a panoply of expenses and hardships when determining child support in a shared parenting arrangement. The Court must take into account the income provided by a new spouse of one or both of the Parties as described in K.A.C.

## C.G.H.

## [871] C.G.H. submits:

- a)  The Parties agreed to equal parent time in the Agreement and he diligently tried to act on that arrangement in the face of S.T.M.'s interference; and
- b)  The Court should conclude that the Agreement set out the parenting time arrangement until it was superseded by the FCC Order and no child support should be payable from the separation until that order.

## DISCUSSION

[872] Despite the Agreement's wording about parenting time the reality was that S.T.M. bore the majority of the day-to-day expenses for B. from the time of the separation until C.G.H. started paying monthly child support in June 2019.

[873] In addition, for several years C.G.H. was accepting of S.T.M.'s care for B. while he completed his education and did his field work for up to six months per year. He left her to cover all of B.'s routine living expenses and contributed to only a portion of the extracurricular, special or extraordinary expenses.

[874] C.G.H.'s submission that he diligently tried to engage the Agreement's terms is not borne out by the evidence. He was often unavailable for parenting time due to his commitments to education, employment or business. Although there were some attempts to address C.G.H.'s concerns through counselling and mediation he took no formal steps to enforce the Agreement until S.T.M. started the litigation.

[875] In the past, no parenting time schedule met the definition described in Section 9 of the CSG and the order for parenting time going forward will not change that situation. Therefore, there is no need to consider the provisions of Section 9 or the case law.

[876] In addition, there is no need to consider the wording 'conditions, means, needs and other circumstances' in Section 9 (c) of the CSG as discussed in Lozinski. A shared parenting arrangement has not existed and will not exist in the immediate future.

## Child Support Guidelines

- [2] The following sections of Child Support Guidelines applicable to the this decision include:

## a)  Incomes over $150,000

- 4 Where the income of the spouse against whom a child support order is sought is over $150,000, the amount of a child support order is
- (a) the amount determined under section 3; or
- (b) if the court considers that amount to be inappropriate,
- (i) in respect of the first $150,000 of the spouse's income, the amount set out in the applicable table for the number of children under the age of majority to whom the order relates;
- (ii) in respect of the balance of the spouse's income, the amount that the court considers appropriate, having regard to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the Children who are entitled to support and the financial ability of each spouse to contribute to the support of the Children; and
- (iii) the amount, if any, determined under section 7.

## b)  Special or extraordinary expenses

- 7 (1) In a child support order the court may, on either spouse's request, provide for an amount to cover all or any portion of the following expenses, which expenses may be estimated, taking into account the necessity of the expense in relation to the Child's best interests and the reasonableness of the expense in relation to the means of the spouses and those of the Child and to the family's spending pattern prior to the separation:
- a)  childcare expenses incurred as a result of the employment, illness, disability or education or training for employment of the spouse who has the majority of parenting time;
- b)  that portion of the medical and dental insurance premiums attributable to the Child;

- c)  health-related expenses that exceed insurance reimbursement by at least $100 annually, including orthodontic treatment, professional counselling provided by a psychologist, social worker, psychiatrist or any other person, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and prescription drugs, hearing aids, glasses and contact lenses;
- d)  extraordinary expenses for primary or secondary school education or for any other educational programs that meet the Child's particular needs;
- e)  expenses for post-secondary education; and
- f) extraordinary expenses for extracurricular activities.

## Definition of 'extraordinary expenses'

- (1.1) For the purposes of paragraphs (1)(d) and (f), the term extraordinary expenses means
- g)  expenses that exceed those that the spouse requesting an amount for the extraordinary expenses can reasonably cover, taking into account that spouse's income and the amount that the spouse would receive under the applicable table or, where the court has determined that the table amount is inappropriate, the amount that the court has otherwise determined is appropriate; or
- h)  where paragraph (a) is not applicable, expenses that the court considers are extraordinary taking into account
- (i)  the amount of the expense in relation to the income of the spouse requesting the amount, including the amount that the spouse would receive under the applicable table or, where the court has determined that the table amount is inappropriate, the amount that the court has otherwise determined is appropriate,
- (ii)  the nature and number of the educational programs and extracurricular activities,
- (iii)  any special needs and talents of JCG or children,
- (iv)  the overall cost of the programs and activities, and
- (v) any other similar factor that the court considers relevant.

## Sharing of expense

- (2) The guiding principle in determining the amount of an expense referred to in subsection (1) is that the expense is shared by the spouses in proportion to their respective

incomes after deducting from the expense, the contribution, if any, from the Child.

## Subsidies, tax deductions, etc.

(3) Subject to subsection (4), in determining the amount of an expense referred to in subsection (1), the court must take into account any subsidies, benefits or income tax deductions or credits relating to the expense, and any eligibility to claim a subsidy, benefit or income tax deduction or credit relating to the expense.

(4) In determining the amount of an expense referred to in subsection (1), the court shall not take into account any universal childcare benefit or any eligibility to claim that benefit.

## c)  Shared parenting time

9 If each spouse exercises not less than 40% of parenting time with a child over the course of a year, the amount of the Child support order must be determined by taking into account

- (a) the amounts set out in the applicable tables for each of the spouses;
- (b) the increased costs of shared parenting time arrangements; and

(c) the conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse and of any child for whom support is sought.

## d)  Calculation of annual income

16 Subject to sections 17 to 20, a spouse's annual income is determined using the sources of income set out under the heading 'Total income' in the T1 General form issued by the Canada Revenue Agency and is adjusted in accordance with Schedule III.

## e)  Pattern of income

17 (1) If the court is of the opinion that the determination of a spouse's annual income under section 16 would not be the fairest determination of that income, the court may have regard to the spouse's income over the last three years and determine an amount that is fair and reasonable in light of any pattern of income, fluctuation in income or receipt of a nonrecurring amount during those years.

## Non-recurring losses

(2) Where a spouse has incurred a non-recurring capital or business investment loss, the court may, if it is of the opinion that the determination of the spouse's annual income under section 16 would not provide the fairest determination of the annual income, choose not to apply sections 6

and 7 of Schedule III, and adjust the amount of the loss, including related expenses and carrying charges and interest expenses, to arrive at such amount as the court considers appropriate.

## f) Shareholder, director or officer

18 (1) Where a spouse is a shareholder, director or officer of a corporation and the court is of the opinion that the amount of the spouse's annual income as determined under section 16 does not fairly reflect all the money available to the spouse for the payment of child support, the court may consider the situations described in section 17 and determine the spouse's annual income to include

- a.  all or part of the pre-tax income of the corporation, and of any corporation that is related to that corporation, for the most recent taxation year; or
- b.  an amount commensurate with the services that the spouse provides to the corporation, provided that the amount does not exceed the corporation's pre-tax income.

## Adjustment to corporation's pre-tax income

(2) In determining the pre-tax income of a corporation for the purposes of subsection (1), all amounts paid by the corporation as salaries, wages or management fees, or other payments or benefits, to or on behalf of persons with whom the corporation does not deal at arm's length must be added to the pre-tax income, unless the spouse establishes that the payments were reasonable in the circumstances.

## g)  Imputing Income

- 19 (1) The court may impute such amount of income to a spouse as it considers appropriate in the circumstances, which circumstances include the following:
- a.  the spouse is intentionally under-employed or unemployed, other than where the under-employment or unemployment is required by the needs of a child of the marriage or any child under the age of majority or by the reasonable educational or health needs of the spouse; […]
- d.  it appears that income has been diverted which would affect the level of child support to be determined under these Guidelines;
- e.  the spouse's property is not reasonably utilized to generate income;

- f. the spouse has failed to provide income information when under a legal obligation to do so;
- g.  the spouse unreasonably deducts expenses from income;
- (2) For the purpose of paragraph (1)(g), the reasonableness of an expense deduction is not solely governed by whether the deduction is permitted under the Income Tax Act.

## i) Obligation of applicant

- 21 (1) A spouse who is applying for a child support order and whose income information is necessary to determine the amount of the order must include the following with the application:
