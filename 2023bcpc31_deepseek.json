  "summary_holding": "The court permitted the mother's relocation to Port Alberni, finding she acted in good faith, proposed reasonable arrangements to preserve the father-child relationship, and that the move was in the child's best interests, as it would enhance stability and the mother's well-being, thereby indirectly benefiting the child.",
  "winning_argument_type": "Comprehensive statutory compliance and evidence-based planning. The mother successfully advanced the 'Holistic Best Interests & Caregiver Well-Being' theory, providing corroborated, multi-faceted reasons for the move (family support, business, finances, housing, opportunities) and a detailed, generous parenting plan that proactively addressed the statutory burdens under FLA s. 69.",
  "failed_argument_type": "Vague opposition lacking substantive alternative. The father's argument failed due to the 'Static Status Quo' fallacy; he merely opposed the change to maintain the existing schedule for his own convenience, offered no alternative plan, and his conduct (blocking counseling, delaying healthcare) undermined his child-focused credibility.",

[para 48]; Notes his 'reluctance to immediately contribute to the cost' of dental/eye care [para 93]; Concern that father's refusal of counseling and programs may not be in child's best interests [para 112].",

  "precedent_gap": "None noted. The court correctly applied the statutory scheme which incorporates the core principles from Gordon v. Goertz and conducted a thorough, child-centric best interests analysis consistent with Barendregt v. Grebliunas.",
  "strategic_takeaway": "Relocation applications succeed with detailed, child-focused plans that proactively address all statutory factors (FLA s. 69) and demonstrate how the relocating guardian's improved stability and well-being will indirectly benefit the child. Vague opposition rooted in preserving the status quo for the non-relocating parent's convenience is insufficient.",
  "counsels_analysis": "<think>ISSUE: Should the mother's application to relocate with the child, A.H., from Nanaimo to Port Alberni be granted under s. 69 of the Family Law Act? RULE: The governing law is Division 6 of Part 4 of the FLA. As the guardians have substantially equal parenting time [para 10], the relocating guardian (mother) bears the burden under s. 69(5) to satisfy the court: (a) the relocation is proposed in good faith (factors in s.69(6)), (b) she has proposed reasonable and workable arrangements to preserve the child's relationship with the father, and (c) that the relocation is in the child's best interests (s.37). APPLICATION: Step 1 – Good Faith (s.69(6)): The judge meticulously applied the four non-exhaustive factors [paras 50-76]. The mother provided five compelling, evidence-backed reasons (family support, business viability, finances, housing stability, opportunities for A.H.) [51]. The judge found these sincere and legitimate [67, 77], noting proper notice was given [74] and no final order restricted relocation [76]. The father's skepticism was noted but did not undermine the good faith finding. Step 2 – Reasonable & Workable Arrangements: The mother presented a highly detailed proposed parenting schedule [78], including 3 out of 4 weekends, half holidays, and equal summer time, with her and M.W. committed to facilitating transportation [79]. The father, when pressed, could propose no alternative [80]. The judge found the plan reasonable and workable, preserving a significant amount of parenting time for the father [82]. Step 3 – Best Interests (s.37): The judge conducted a factor-by-factor analysis [83-116]. Key findings favoring relocation: A.H.'s emotional well-being is tied to the mother's, which would be enhanced by the move [89-90]; the mother is more involved in schooling/health decisions [86, 94, 112]; relocation offers more long-term stability via homeownership prospects and consistent school-week parenting [108, 110]; the father-child relationship would remain strong under the new schedule [101]. Factors against relocation (less weekday time, loss of local school friends) were deemed mitigatable [100]. The father's obstructive conduct (refusing counseling, delaying healthcare, foul language) negatively impacted his position under factors (f) and (i) [111-112]. CONCLUSION: All three statutory burdens were met on a balance of probabilities. The relocation is permitted.</think>\n\nFinal analysis: The mother secured a decisive victory by mastering the statutory formula. Her lawyer built an impeccable evidentiary record that connected concrete, adult-life advantages (finances, career, family support) to indirect benefits for the child's stability and well-being, while neutering the father's opposition by exposing its self-serving and obstructive nature. The judgment is a primer on how to successfully prosecute a relocation under the FLA's structured regime.",
