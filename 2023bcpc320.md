## A.  INTRODUCTION

- [1] On November 1, 2023, I made an order relating to the parenting issues arising from the pleadings in this case. The decision had been adjourned once, from October 20, 2023. As explained at the time, given that the children who are at the heart of this case were aware of the issues before the court, I concluded that deferring their learning the outcome of the matter, yet again, was not in their best interests. Consequently, I gave my decision, with reasons to follow. These are those reasons, described as 'Part 1'. 'Part 2' will address the financial issues between the parties, which remains under reserve.
- [2] The November 1 order is significant: it orders the relocation of the parties' children from [Mom's community], where they have lived with Ms. H. for seven years, to [Dad's community], to live with Mr. B.

## (i)  The pleadings related to the children

- [3] The initiating pleading underpinning the case is Ms. H.'s Application About a Family Law Matter, filed on June 1, 2022 at [omitted for publication] (Document #98). In it, she seeks an order in relation to the children for: (i) exclusive parenting responsibilities; (ii) prohibiting Mr. B.'s participation at joint meetings with the children's professionals; (iii) alternating choice of summertime parenting schedule; (iv) requiring regular contact with the children when with Mr. B., and (v) that he provide exact flight details in relation to parenting time.
- [4] On January 25, 2023, Mr. B. filed an Amended Reply and Counter-application (Document #108) in which he disagrees with Ms. H.'s sought relief with regard to the children, and seeks an order that: (i) the children's primary residence be changed to his residence in [Dad's community], and (ii) they be permitted to fly alone under the Unaccompanied Minors' Program. On February 17, 2023, Ms. H. filed a Reply to a Counter-application (Document #115), disagreeing with the relief sought by Mr. B.

## PART 1

## (ii) The trial

- [5] This is the parties' third trial in Provincial Court: the first trial arose from Mr. B.'s application to set aside the separation agreement; the resulting order, made on May 10, 2018, established the current parenting time schedule. The second trial arose from his application relating to, largely, support issues.
- [6] The trial was held largely in [omitted for publication]. It proceeded on February 27, 28, March 1, 2, 3, July 4, 5, 6, August 21, 22, 23, September 1, 11 and 13, all 2023. Counsel made submissions on September 13 and filed written argument.
- [7] Both parties testified. As well, Ms. H. called K.M., A.B.'s Grade [omitted for publication] teacher, and L.P., his Child and Youth Mental Health ('CYMH') Counsellor from April 2021 to late 2022.
- [8] Documentary evidence includes: the parties' separation agreement; a full s. 211 report prepared in 2017; a Views of the Child s. 211 report ordered during this trial; Reasons for Judgment from the two previous trials; psychiatric consult reports; school documents, including a referral to a highly-supported school program; report cards; a psycho-ed report; OT and PT assessment; doctors' notes; and correspondence and other documents relating to the children from 2017 onward.

## (iii) Background

- [9] The parties' two children, A.B. (born on [omitted for publication]), and N.B. ('N.' born on [omitted for publication]), were nearly [omitted for publication] old and just over [omitted for publication] when the parties separated in 2016. They all lived in [omitted for publication] at the time.
- [10] Their parents entered into a separation agreement drafted by Ms. H.'s lawyer on March 15, 2016; the agreement was filed in the Provincial Court. One of its terms permitted Ms. H. to leave the family community of [omitted for publication] and relocate with the children to [omitted for publication]. The separation agreement states '. . . she has a family support network in [omitted for publication] and can improve her education and career prospects'. Once in [omitted for publication], Ms. H. purchased a three-

bedroom town home with 75% of the proceeds of the sale of the family's [omitted for publication] home. She and the children have lived there ever since.

- [11] Ms. H. testified that the parties had, at one time, considered relocating together to [omitted for publication] as a family. The 2017 full s. 211 report confirms this, and states that Mr. B. 'ruled it out given the stability of his job and the affordable cost of living'. That report further reflects his finding that it is 'difficult to play an active role in the children's lives given the distance and costs associated with seeing them'. He has stayed in [omitted for publication] since, and retained full-time well-paying employment, although laterally, he has been on long-term disability at a reduced income. He is remarried and lives with his wife and [omitted for publication] daughter.
- [12] Since kindergarten, or just before, and shortly after moving to [omitted for publication], A.B. began acting violently and in anti-social ways, including biting, hitting and threatening peers. His dysregulated behaviour is repeatedly described as 'extreme' by professionals dealing with him, and has continued for years: much of the evidence in this trial focused on A.B.'s behaviour and the various professionals he has seen, and their consternation at finding an actual diagnosis to explain his behaviour.
- [13] Since an order was made on May 10, 2018, the children have spent a week at Christmas and spring break with their dad in [Dad's community] and one month or so in the summer. Until February 2022 or so, the children and Mr. B. Skyped regularly.
- [14] Ms. H. has taken the lead role in deciding how to deal with the children's issues, despite Mr. B.'s repeated requests for meaningful input. She provided information to the children's health and education professionals often without Mr. B.'s input or review for the first few years following the parties' separation. Her ability to take this role was facilitated by the reality that she and the children were hundreds of kilometres away from Mr. B. The parties have frequently disagreed about those decisions and their relationship has been marred by that discord; the children are acutely aware of the discord.

- [15] Both A.B. and N. have been diagnosed with cyclic vomiting - both, since around the date of their parents' relationship problems. They both do better now, and are on meds for this condition.
- [16] Ms. H. has not worked outside the home significantly since the parties separated and she has completed one education course. The evidence shows that she needed to be available to pick A.B. up from school when he acted violently and that that was frequent, particularly in kindergarten and the early grades.
- [17] The children's environment, likely starting sometime in 2017, has included J.W. He lived with Ms. H. and the children from 2018 - 2022. Ms. H. testified that he moved out in January 2022 and that they are no longer in a romantic relationship. She described him as her 'former partner'. On January 7, 2022, Judge Challenger made an order that he '. . . will cease living in the home of… [Ms. H.] and the children by January 8, 2022'.
- [18] While this order has not been varied or appealed, Ms. H. also testified that currently Mr. W. is at their home daily; he buys groceries and makes them dinner nightly, but does not sleep over. The January 7 order arose from A.B.'s disclosure of Mr. W.'s violence toward him, discussed below.
- [19] Having considered all of the evidence, I have found that the arrangements provided for in the 2016 separation agreement, as modified by order in 2018, have not been in the children's best interests in a number of significant ways. I have concluded that both children have been exposed to family violence - A.B., by Ms. H.'s partner J.W., and N., by A.B. I have concluded that Ms. H. has omitted important information in her discussions with A.B.'s education and health professionals and has, as well, provided them with false information which had the very real risk of their considering that false information while trying to determine the cause of the onset of A.B.'s emotional dysregulation. I have concluded that, to their detriment, she has discussed adult matters with them, including issues relating to financial support payments, and coaching them in relation to the preparation of the s. 211 Views of the Child report this

past spring. Finally, I have concluded that their current lifestyle is insufficiently active and is inconsistent with healthy physical and social development.

- [20] The children need to be given an opportunity to begin to thrive as quickly as possible, in the most positive and healthy environment available to them; hence, my decision of November 1.
- [21] Turning to the structure of this decision, after discussing the parties' positions, I turn to a brief consideration of the law with regard to the issues raised in the pleadings and in relation to the issue of credibility. Apart from a brief consideration of the parties' credibility, the factors set out in subsections 37(2)(a) - (j) of the Family Law Act (' FLA ') guide much of the remaining discussion, followed by consideration of the case law.

## B. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS

## (i)  Ms. H.

- [22] Ms. H. says that both children are 'special needs'. She advocates for a diagnosis of A.B. in particular, given his behaviour. She says that Mr. B.'s involvement in this pursuit is disruptive, not helpful, and that he treats her badly when they jointly meet with professionals about their children.
- [23] Ms. H. says that Ms. M. and Ms. P. confirm her view that A.B. has serious behavioural challenges which need diagnosing.
- [24] She says that an order that she have exclusive parenting responsibilities is consistent with the children's best interests, given the acrimony between the parties.
- [25] Ms. H. points to the history of the children's care and her significant role in their lives and the strength of their relationships and says that their relocating to [Dad's community] would not be in their best interests.
5. (ii) Mr. B.
- [26] Mr. B. does not dispute that A.B. has some behavioural issues; however, his experience is that the child's emotional dysregulation is less while in his care than as

reported by others while in [Mom's community]. He says that neither child is as physically or socially developed as they should be and that their lives are largely sedentary currently, while their lives are physically and socially active when with him and their extended family in [Dad's community].

- [27] Mr. B. says that Ms. H. did not deal with family violence in a manner consistent with A.B.'s best interests when her partner struck A.B. and says as well that Ms. H. is not forthright about her partner's current role in the children's lives.
- [28] He says that Ms. H. has made false allegations about his being violent and that these allegations have undermined his relationships with health and educational professionals, thus lessening his influence and, as well, led the professionals to consider issues not actually part of A.B.'s experience.
- [29] He says that Ms. H. medicates the children as a first step, rather than exploring lifestyle changes. He says that she generally ignores his input, making decisions about the children's physical and emotional well-being without him and that this, along with her failure to take steps to become financially self-sufficient, has led to friction between them.

## C. LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS

## (i)  Legislation

- [30] Subsection 37(1) of the FLA mandates that the only consideration in determining the outcome of these issues relating to parenting responsibilities and parenting time is the children's best interests.
- [31] Subsection 37(2) sets out a list of non-exhaustive factors to consider: (a) the child's health and emotional well-being; (b) their views, unless it would be inappropriate to consider them; (c) the nature and strength of the child's relationships and significant persons in their lives; (d) the history of care; (e) the child's need for stability, given their age and stage of development; (f) the ability of each person who is a guardian . . . to exercise his or her responsibilities; (g) the impact of any family violence on the child's

safety, security or well-being, whether it is directed toward the child or another family member; (h) whether the actions of a person responsible for family violence indicate that the person may be impaired in his or her ability to care for the child and meet the child's needs; (i) the appropriateness of an arrangement that would require the guardians' cooperation . . .; (j) any civil or criminal proceeding relevant to the child's safety, security or well-being.

## [32] Subsection 37(3) provides:

Best interests of child

37 . . .

- (3)  An agreement or order is not in the best interests of a child unless it protects, to the greatest extent possible, the child's physical, psychological and emotional safety, security and wellbeing .
- [33] Subsection 37(4) provides that in making an order such as the one here, 'a court may consider a person's conduct only if it substantially affects a factor set out in subsection (2) and only to the extent that it affects that factor.'
- [34] Section 38 addresses the assessing of family violence for the purposes of subsections 37(2)(g) and (h), and provides nine factors that must be considered.
- [35] Sections 44 (re: agreements), 47 (re: variation of orders), and 69 (re: relocation), are also relevant to the issues here.

## (ii) Caselaw

- [36] Ms. H. relies on KSP v. JTP , 2022 BCSC 1727; Hansen v. Mantei-Hansen , 2013 BCSC 876; and SLL v. MCW , 2018 BCSC 1863.
- [37] Mr. B. relies on GM1 v. Mr.GM 2 , 2004 BCSC 1664, and McGhee v. Ecker , 1999 CanLII 12784 (SKQB), in relation to the issues discussed here.
- [38] I have also considered Nijjar v. Gill, 2017 BCSC 1362 , and Barendregt v. Grebliunas , 2022 SCC 22.

- [39] With regard to the issue of credibility, I have considered Bradshaw v. Stenner , 2010 BCSC 1398, (2012 BCCA 296).

## D. DISCUSSION OF CREDIBILITY AS RELATED TO THE PARTIES

- [40] Both parties contend that the testimony of the other should be given little weight due to credibility issues. In considering this issue, I have regard to Justice Dillon's approach to assessing credibility set out in Bradshaw v. Stenner:
- [186]  Credibility involves an assessment of the trustworthiness of a witness' testimony based upon the veracity or sincerity of a witness and the accuracy of the evidence that the witness provides ( Raymond v. Bosanquet (Township) (1919), 1919 CanLII 11 (SCC), 59 S.C.R. 452, 50 D.L.R. 560 (S.C.C.)). The art of assessment involves examination of various factors such as the ability and opportunity to observe events, the firmness of [their] memory, the ability to resist the influence of interest to modify [their] recollection, whether the witness' evidence harmonizes with independent evidence that has been accepted, whether the witness changes [their] testimony during direct and cross-examination, whether the witness' testimony seems unreasonable, impossible, or unlikely, whether a witness has a motive to lie, and the demeanour of a witness generally ( Wallace v. Davis , [1926] 31 O.W.N. 202 (Ont.H.C.); Farnya v. Chorny , [1952] 2 D.L.R. 152 (B.C.C.A.) [ Farnya ]; R. v. S.(R.D.) , 1997 CanLII 324 (SCC), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484 at para.128 (S.C.C.)). Ultimately, the validity of the evidence depends on whether the evidence is consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole and shown to be in existence at the time ( Farnya at para. 356).

[187]  It has been suggested that a methodology to adopt is to first consider the testimony of a witness on a 'stand alone' basis, followed by an analysis of whether the witness' story is inherently believable. Then, if the witness testimony has survived relatively intact, the testimony should be evaluated based upon the consistency with other witnesses and with documentary evidence. The testimony of non-party, disinterested witnesses may provide a reliable yardstick for comparison. Finally, the court should determine which version of events is the most consistent with the 'preponderance of probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions' ( Overseas Investments (1986) Ltd. v. Cornwall Developments Ltd. (1993), 1993 CanLII 7140 (AB KB), 12 Alta. L.R. (3d) 298 at para. 13 (Alta. Q.B.)). I have found this approach useful.

- [41] With this in mind, I turn first to a consideration of Mr. B. and then Ms. H.'s evidence at this trial.

## (i)  Mr. B.

- [42] Overall, I found Mr. B. to be a credible witness. His testimony was internally consistent on important points, including his experience with A.B. behaving differently while in his care, from the child's behaviour while in [Mom's community]. It was also consistent with Ms. P.'s observations of A.B. during Zoom calls from [omitted for publication], described below. As well, it was corroborated to some degree by documents reflecting the children's participation in organized activities while there.
- [43] Mr. B. was forthright about having not maintained Ms. H. as a life insurance beneficiary despite the separation agreement requiring him to do so. He also agreed that he had unilaterally stopped paying spousal support, contrary to the terms of the agreement.
- [44] That said, he also testified that he was unaware of his spouse's income. I find that unlikely and note that he produced a document where her income is edited out by a black marker, which suggests that the information is available to him.
- [45] With regard to his text message to Ms. H. from 11 years ago, produced by Ms. H., relating to his behaviour and apparent contrition surrounding the breakdown of the parties' relationship, I found it had little relevance to an assessment of his credibility. He testified to being in a negative place at the time of separation and to making great strides to secure a stable disposition and life, both of which he appears to have secured for himself. He testified that he admitted to things back then that were not true, in the context of the dissolution of the family and in an effort to maintain a relationship with the children.
- [46] Having had the opportunity to observe Mr. B. on the witness stand and assess his testimony with a view to its internal consistency, its consistency with other witnesses' testimony and with documents in evidence, I conclude that he was overall a credible witness with regard to the children, their activities, their statements to him, factors relating to their overall well-being, and with regard to his interactions with Ms. H.

## (ii) Ms. H.

[47] Turning to Ms. H.'s credibility, four areas of her evidence are particularly significant to the assessment. These relate to (i) Mr. B. and his wife's discussing support payments with A.B. in the summer of 2022; (ii) her allegation that Mr. B. spanked A.B. in 2017; (iii) her report to school officials that Mr. B. was physically violent toward her, and (iv) A.B.'s not telling her that he felt unsafe around J.W. Some of this discussion is relevant to section 37(2) factors, as discussed below. I have concluded that Ms. H. has repeatedly provided false information to third parties and has as well sought to undermine the reliability of the court-ordered evidence (the Views of the Child report) by influencing the children. All in all, she was not a credible witness.

## (iii) Mr. B. and his wife's discussing support payments with A.B. in the summer of 2022

[48] Ms. H. testified that A.B. told her that during his summer visit to Mr. B.'s home in [Dad's community] in 2022, Mr. B. had shown him an official-looking document. She testified that A.B. said the document set out that she blames A.B. for her inability to work. There was some suggestion that he may have been referring to an affidavit. While testifying about this, Ms. H.'s voice was low, shaky and she sounded on the edge of tears. She testified that A.B. told her that she could not accuse his dad of not paying her because his dad and S. (Mr. B.'s wife) had shown him a payment in the sum of $1,229.

[49] Ms. H. testified that Mr. B. reduced his support payments to $1,229 monthly - the figure she said A.B. told her he had seen - which she viewed as an 'incorrect' sum. Her counsel asked if the child actually stated that dollar amount and Ms. H. confirmed that he had. She also asserted that she never talks to the kids negatively about Mr. B. and never discusses court proceedings with them.

[50] Based upon her demeanour and tone, she appeared to be upset and saddened by the topics of A.B.'s disclosure and Mr. B.'s actions with the child.

[51] Mr. B. denied discussing any court documents with A.B. He denied discussing support payments with the child or showing him documents related to such payments, as Ms. H. testified that A.B. had described.

[52] Mr. B. testified that during the summer of 2022 when A.B. was with him, he was still paying Ms. H. $2,229 in monthly support. He testified that it was only in October 2022 that his monthly payments changed from $2,229 to $1,229 - the specific amount that Ms. H. testified that A.B. told her he saw, months before.

[53] Mr. B.'s testimony is corroborated by statements from his BMO bank account which show online payments to 'Fam Maint Enfor' (which I understand to indicate 'Family Maintenance Enforcement') on July 29 and August 31, 2022 in the amount of $2,229. The September statement is missing, but on October 3, 2022, the amount paid online to Fam Maint Enfor is $1,229.

[54] There is no evidence that the figure $1,229 - cited to by Ms. H. and seemingly a hallmark of the reliability of her recollection - was a figure relevant to the parties in any way, let alone support payments, at the time of A.B.'s stay with his dad in the summer of 2022: it arose later in 2022.

[55] The bank statement is objective evidence which proves that Ms. H.'s testimony about A.B. being shown a payment in the amount of $1,229 is inaccurate. I find he could not have been, as Mr. B. was still paying $2,229 to Ms. H. at that time.

[56] I find as a fact that Mr. B. and his wife did not show A.B. information about Mr. B.'s support payments in the amount of $1,229, or at all. The corollary of this conclusion is that Ms. H.'s story was false, as was her apparent upset demeanour on the witness stand.

## (iv) allegations that Mr. B. spanked A.B. in 2017

[57] The GP's notes from A.B.'s [omitted for publication] check-up on March 6, 2017 records: 'Mom has no concerns re: school readiness,' and are consistent with A.B.'s troubling behaviour beginning after this date. The notes do not reflect any concern about mistreatment of A.B.

[58] I pause to note that given that Mr. W. moved in with Ms. H. and the children in 2018, it is likely that he was in the children's lives by late 2017.

[59] On November 8, 2017, Ms. H. attended the doctor's office and told him that eight months earlier (which is to say, proximate to the March 6 check-up mentioned above), A.B. had told her that his dad had spanked him; she said that MCFD was involved. The medical chart notes include:

Some concerns re behavior at school - he has been hitting adults at school. Not hitting other kids. No aggressive behaviour towards mom or sibs. Seems to be improving with counselling - school and H.S. On half days at school until things improve consistently. Has reported spanking by father the last time there was contact (about 8 months ago). Mom ++ concerned. MCFD aware and involved. Dad was supposed to come visit this month, but this has since been cancelled.

Mom notes he started wetting his bed again when he found out his dad was coming to visit. Had been good for months prior to that. Seems to have stopped again, once he found out his dad wasn't coming. Happy, cooperative friendly talkative. Did not ask him directly about what had happened with his father today. Cyclical vomiting - in remission with cyprophetadine.

Acting out at school -towards non-family adults only. Some concern that he has experienced abusive behavior by dad. Appropriate supports and follow up in place.

Enuresis appears to be linked to stress around dad. (My emphasis.)

- [60] The full section 211 report, ordered on December 14, 2016, reflects that interviews of the parents took place between May 19, 2017 and November 29, 2017. I note the proximity between Ms. H.'s report to the GP of dad's spanking, and the preparation of the s. 211 report for court purposes, and no mention of the alleged spanking closer in time to its supposed occurrence.
- [61] In the full 211 report, the writer writes:

A.H. questions M.'s ability to control his anger, especially as it relates to appropriate discipline of the children when they are in his care. She has had reports from A.B. that his father has spanked him when he has misbehaved.

(My emphasis.)

- [62] While Ms. H.'s reporting to the s. 211 writer is consistent with her November 8 report of spanking to the GP, the s. 211 report does not reflect that Ms. H. said that MCFD was involved. Such a factor would, I find, likely be notable, and, also likely something that a s. 211 report writer could be expected to follow up on. This omission renders Ms. H.'s report to the 211 writer different to her near-in-time report to the doctor in a significant way.
- [63] The full s. 211 report does not reflect Ms. H.'s concerns about Mr. B.'s use of corporal punishment. The writer concludes: 'There does not appear to be any safety concerns limiting the ability of M. to take the children to [omitted for publication]'. This conclusion is inconsistent with the recurring theme of Mr. B.'s abuse reflected in later medical records.
- [64] As mentioned, Mr. B. was unshaken in his testimony that he did not spank A.B.; further, he testified that he made inquiries at MCFD about any reporting of such actions and produced a letter from MCFD dated April 13, 2021 that states that no file has been opened by MCFD in relation to him, despite Ms. H.'s reporting in 2017 that MCFD was involved. While obviously hearsay, he points out that Ms. H. adduced no objective evidence supporting her statement to the GP that MCFD was involved.
- [65] A 'Plan' written by the GP includes:

Encouraged to continue connecting with counsellors and MCFD. Hopefully he is able to find healthier ways to cope with stress and the underlying stressor is addressed.

The chart notes reflect repeated comments that A.B.'s anxiety seems to increase with, or be associated to, his upcoming visits with his father. All of this comes from Ms. H.

(My emphasis.)

- [66] I note that in the full 2017 s. 211 report, the writer observes:

A.B. (omitted for publication) is a personable child, with a variety of interests. According to the daycare provider and his mother he has been

upset about pending visits with his father, but my observations of A.B. in his father's care did not indicate any level of discomfort: (p. 6). (My emphasis.)

[67] Given the apparent delay between the alleged spanking and Ms. H.'s reporting it, the inconsistencies between Ms. H.'s allegations to the doctor and to the s. 211 report writer, the proximity of the s. 211 report date and her report to the GP, as well as the apparent lack of actual report by Ms. H. to MCFD despite her assertion that she reported the spanking to MCFD, I find that it is likely that Ms. H.'s allegation that Mr. B. spanked A.B. during his brief parenting time in [Dad's community] in 2017 is false. Despite this, the allegation appears to be treated as fact by the GP and then gets transmitted to A.B.'s psychiatrist, all of which I find to be inconsistent with the child's best interests.

## (iv) report to school officials that Mr. B. was physically violent toward Ms. H.

[68] A school record entitled [omitted for publication] ('SCAS') Referral Form for SHARE, dated February 2, 2018, contains a section headed ' Background Information (include behavior, attendance, school and family history. ' In this section, the following is stated:

A.B. had a serious violent incident on October 12, that left the principal bruised from multiple bites during a CPI hold. Prior to that he had hit and punched his teacher a number of times. . . A.B. has a younger brother. Mom reports that the reason she and dad are not together is that he was physically abusive towards her. Dad now has another girlfriend, who is expecting a baby. A.B. sees the girlfriend more as a sister, not a stepmother. A.B. meets with the school counsellor regularly. . . . (My emphasis.)

[69] Testifying, Ms. H. initially denied that she had told the record-maker that the parties' relationship dissolved because Mr. B. was physically abusive towards her. Given the nature of the document and her overall evidence about it, I am satisfied that it is likely that the form accurately reflects what Ms. H. said.

[70] Under their separation agreement, Ms. H. was the child's primary caregiver. Mr. B. was hundreds of kilometres away. I find that Ms. H. knew that it was unlikely that Mr. B. would see this document, given their logistics and her role in the children's lives.

[71] In contrast to the school referral form, there is no reference to Mr. B. physically abusing Ms. H. in the 2017 full s. 211 report. I note that rather than saying that Mr. B. physically abused her in the interview for the 2017 full s. 211 report - a copy of which Mr. B. would obviously receive - Ms. H. referred to Mr. B.'s alleged infidelities as the basis of their relationship's ending.

[72] Similarly, in the psychiatric consultation in December 2019 in relation to A.B. (a setting which I find would be a place where disclosure of such information would be likely), Ms. H. made no reference to physical abuse; rather, she is reported as saying that Mr. B. was deceitful and a sex addict.

[73] I note that in the medico-legal report prepared by Ms. H.'s family doctor for this lawsuit, the doctor reflects Ms. H. reporting factors exacerbating her mental-health issues as including 'an acrimonious divorce and custody battle', caring for two highneeds children and 'an abusive childhood with an alcoholic father'. There is no reference to intimate partner violence.

[74] In Ms. P.'s testimony, she testified that Ms. H. had never said that she had been physically abused and had made reference to a document that made mention of abuse, upon which she did not want to rely. This conversation occurred sometime after April 2021, as that is when Ms. P. began working with A.B.

[75] When asked in cross-examination if she had ever raised the topic of Mr. B.'s being physically abusive during their years of litigation, Ms. H. was non-responsive, repeatedly. After being directed by the court to answer the question responsively, Ms. H. testified that she believed that the document writer was referring to Mr. B.'s infidelities during their marriage, explaining that she had disclosed that he had engaged in extramarital sexual activity while she was pregnant; she then testified that she raised that as an issue in their relationship during the referral.

- [76] Mr. B. testified that he has never been physically abusive toward Ms. H. He was not shaken on the point in cross-examination.

[77] In addition to finding that Ms. H. in fact made the statement reflected in the referral document - that the parties' relationship ended because of Mr. B.'s abuse of her - I also find that the assertion itself was likely false, given the internal inconsistencies in her evidence, and the inconsistencies between her testimony and other, more reliable evidence on the topic.

- [78] Ms. H. ultimately testified that Mr. B. was in fact physically violent - that he has thrown a book at her and had anger issues and that that is what she was referring to, reflected in this document.
- [79] Ms. M. testified that she had heard that Mr. B. had been physically abusive from a [omitted for publication] elementary school teacher. Given the content of this school form, such rumour amongst the children's teachers is unsurprising but inconsistent with their best interests.
- [80] The last entry in the referral document is the following:

Legal alert - Father, M.B., is not able to pick up A.B. without a one week notice to the mothers (sic). Mom is to be called immediately if father contacts the school.

- [81] Ms. M. testified that she had never seen such an alert before.

(vi) A.B.'s not telling Ms. H. that he felt unsafe around J.W.

- [82] Ms. H. testified that A.B did not tell her about feeling unsafe with Mr. W. She did not equivocate on the point. Both Ms. P. and Mr. B. testified that they heard the child tell his mom that he felt unsafe with Mr. W.

## E. DISCUSSION OF THE EVIDENCE IN RELATION TO SECTION 37(2) FACTORS

## s. 37(2)(a): the child's health and emotional well-being

- (i)  A.B.

## (a) his emotional well-being since 2017/2018

[83] As reflected in his [omitted for publication] check-up, there was no concern about A.B.'s beginning school as of March 2017. However, the little boy began acting violently and anti-socially just before beginning kindergarten that same year. Since then, he has been seen by: General Practitioner Dr. S.; then by Dr. Freedman, his first paediatrician; by Dr. Rosenauer, a paediatric psychiatrist; by a second paediatrician, Dr. Kalaci; by L.P., a counsellor at Child and Youth Mental Health services, and now, his new counsellor, K. An actual diagnosis underpinning's A.B.'s behaviour has eluded all of these professionals.

[84] As a result of dysregulating and being violent, A.B. missed a lot of kindergarten and was removed from the school's mainstream and referred to specially supported programs in [omitted for publication] called the SHARE Program (grades 1 - 3) and the Field Program (grades 4 and part of grade 5). These classes are comprised of six (6) students, all with significant issues.

[85] Ms. M. taught A.B. in the SHARE Program and observed his behaviour during those years which included frequent dysregulation, with the attendant consequence of his being taken home early by Ms. H.

[86] Ms. P. was his counsellor from April 2021 to December 2022. She saw him 35 times. She has a Masters in counselling psychology degree and a Masters in education, both from the US. She has an educational psychology degree from Scotland. Ms. P. is experienced in mental-health issues and was an impressive, careful, balanced witness, with no apparent interest in the outcome of this case other than A.B.'s best interests. Given the relative recency of her interactions with A.B. and her in-depth knowledge of the child, I found her evidence about his well-being important and give it significant weight.

[87] Ms. P. only works with children with moderate to severe mental-health issues. She worked in conjunction with A.B.'s then-psychiatrist, Dr. Rosenauer. Given her training and experience, she was involved in trying to identify the source of A.B.'s behaviour, but any actual diagnosis was left up to the psychiatrist.

[88] Ms. P. describes A.B. as a 'very complex child'. While there were a number of hypotheses or working diagnoses for A.B., she struggled to come up with any initially, given that the psychiatrist could not determine what was going on. She observed him at school. She testified that the child's taking medications complicated the diagnosis process. She said that it is very difficult to say how much of A.B.'s difficulties is related to mental-health difficulties and how much to neurodevelopmental considerations, which needs to be assessed. She does not agree with the provisional diagnosis of complex PTSD made by Dr. Rosenauer in 2019. While she has concluded that it does not seem that A.B. has ADHD - as the relevant features do not appear in all of his environments as of March 2022, she agreed that it should be looked at again. She noted that anxiety does not appear in all environments. Ms. P.'s observations echo A.B.'s first paediatrician, Dr. Freedman, who saw no 'overarching neurodevelopmental' issue for the child.

[89] Ms. P. observed A.B. interact with Ms. H. during her first eight to ten visits with the child, and as well, at appointment pick-ups and drop-off. As well, she went to his school and observed him there, interacting with peers while in the Field Program. She expressed concerns about his needing to interact with kids outside that program, for his development.

[90] She stated that between November 2021 and February 2022, the school reported seven incidents of aggressive behaviour, where Ms. H. had to pick him up. These included his kicking a class teacher and hitting his head. She testified that he has gone through phases of turning the aggression to himself, although she testified that she did not know that A.B. had wrapped a blind cord around his neck until Mr. B. told her on November 21, 2022.

[91] In the beginning of 2023, as a result of discussion with Ms. H. (that did not include Mr. B.), A.B. began working with a new counsellor, K., in [Mom's community]. Ms. P. testified that Mr. B. was advised of that decision. She explained that there was not a lot of choice in the matter, as she had changed her positon such that her client load was going to be cut in half. She noted that K. works in [omitted for publication], where A.B. and Ms. H. live and that Ms. H. wanted a change.

- [92] A CYMH Comprehensive Report from December 14, 2022 identifies A.B.'s needs:
- i. Improve coping with overwhelming feelings;
- ii. Raise confidence;
- iii. Increase frustration tolerance;
- iv. Improve his social and peer interactions (he is very rule bound).
- [93] Ms. P. testified that these remain relevant. As well, she agreed with a planned autism assessment for the child.
- [94] Turning to Ms. M.'s testimony relating to this factor, her involvement with A.B. is less current.
- [95] She described his extreme and repeated dysregulation, particularly in kindergarten and his earlier school years. She described his having difficulty with change. She described his engaging in three acts of apparent self-harm, by placing a window blind cord around his neck, once in April 2021, once in October 2021, and lastly, on May 5, 2023. She testified to the effect that these events are not as bad as they sound when you read about them. I understood her to mean that while placing a cord on one's neck could be an expression of actual suicidal ideation, no one proximate to these events thought that that was actually what was going on with A.B. I note that she testified that in her view, she suspects that some of A.B.'s 'clumsiness' in the classroom is intentional, and that this is reflected in an Occupational and Physical Therapy report prepared in February 2019. As well, there is reference to his showing 'learned helplessness' in one of her reports.

- [96] While each time A.B. put the cord on his neck, his mom picked him up, Ms. M. testified that she did not think that A.B. was doing this just to get to go home, although she did not explain how she reached that conclusion. She did say that A.B. had told her at some point that he did not want to be sent home because his dad finds out.

## (b) early efforts at diagnosing A.B.: relevance of 'social history'

- [97] As mentioned, the evidence shows that A.B. did not experience behavioural issues until just before kindergarten in 2017.
- [98] By late 2019, he was prescribed risperidone, an antipsychotic medication, to address his violent behaviour; caution with regard to its possibly having 'a worrisome side effect profile' is noted in the medical records.
- [99] In early reports, professionals dealing with A.B. appeared to give weight to the recent significant changes in the child's life as a possible explanation for his dysregulation and violent behaviour. In a Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy Integrated Assessment Report written in February 2019 when A.B. was not quite [omitted for publication], the following is set out:

A.B. did not have challenges with violence until the end of his daycare experience where he started hitting his peers. His challenges then continued into kindergarten. A possible cause was that there had been changes in his life where his parents separated and he moved to the [Mom's community]. A.B. visits his father in [Dad's community] during vacations times throughout the year and they connect via skype twice weekly.

(My emphasis.)

- [100] After A.B.'s first psychiatric consult on December 18, 2019, Dr. Rosenauer writes:

. . . as A.B.'s social history is significant to the development of his emotional behavioral profile, a summary of the social history is offered below.

(My emphasis.)

[101] I find that these reports reflect that A.B.'s health and emotional well-being would have been served by an accurate and complete description of his social history and potential stressors being given to the professionals dealing with him.

[102] Instead (as discussed above), I find that these professionals were provided false information about Mr. B.'s treatment of A.B. and the child's background included family violence toward Ms. H., and not given details relating to her having a new partner in the children's lives early on. Later, she omitted mention of that partner's engaging in family violence with A.B.

[103] I now turn to a discussion of information which I conclude was untrue and which I find deprived A.B.'s education and health professionals from considering accurate factors in considering his behavioural and emotional dysregulation (see: s. 37(4)).

## (c) misinformation by Ms. H.

[104] As set out, I find as fact that Ms. H. falsely alleged that Mr. B. spanked A.B. in late 2017 to Dr. S. and that she falsely told the writer of the SHARE referral document that the parties' relationship ended as a result of Mr. B.'s physically abusing her. These assertions became imbedded in third parties' assessment of A.B.'s background and its potential impact on his emotional dysregulation, likely to his detriment.

[105] As well as misreporting the occurrence of the violent events mentioned above, Ms. H. omitted information likely relevant to an assessment of A.B.'s actual 'social history'. A note prepared Dr. S. dated December 18, 2018, records:

Recurrence enuresis over the past few weeks - he is going to visit his father over the holidays. No other stressor id'd - by mom . . . (My emphasis.)

[106] The evidence shows that, in addition to moving from their home in [Dad's community], away from their father and paternal grandparents, the children were now living with a new adult who likely occupied a surrogate father-figure role - J.W. Despite this reality for A.B., the chart reflects that the only circumstance that Ms. H. identified as a possible stressor in the young child's life was an upcoming visit with his father.

- [107] Dr. S., the children's GP, did not testify at trial. Mr. B. testified that he has never spoken to the doctor.
- [108] The predictable perpetuation of Ms. H.'s allegations of Mr. B.'s mistreatment of A.B. is reflected in Dr. S.'s referral correspondence to paediatricians involved with the family. Dr. S. refers to the spanking and possible abuse of A.B. by Mr. B., reported by Ms. H., as fact. He writes:

. . . He has also exhibited nocturnal enuresis during prior to paternal visits in the past. As you will recall, A.B. lives primarily with his mom, but visits his dad on holidays and in the summer. Mom tries to employ gentle parenting techniques and does not use corporal punishment, but report that physical punishment is a feature of A.B.'s discipline when he is with his dad. She does not believe that it has gone beyond 'spanking,' but has reported her concerns to social services on a number of occasions. A.B. was unwilling to discuss this with me in the clinic today.

I suspect that A.B.'s behavioral issues are rooted in the disruption of his family unit and by anxiety related to a challenging (and possibly abusive) home environment when he stays with his father. . . .

(My emphasis.)

- [109] In a note dated February 27, 2019, Dr. S. writes:
2. . . . he can be violent towards others and destructive towards property. Behavior happens mostly at school, sometimes at home. Seems to be worsens prior to visiting father, who apparently uses corporal punishment (spanking). Dad has been unwilling to change approach to date and A.H. has been unable to address with him. She is not aware of anything beyond spanking and does not use corporal punishment herself. (My emphasis.)
- [110] Ms. H.'s false reporting of Mr. B.'s mistreating A.B. came at a cost to the child: I find that he was deprived of having an accurate 'social history' given to the professionals trying to help him. Back in 2017, Mr. B. told the s. 211 report writer that he believed that 'A.H. is determined to discredit him as a parent'. I find that his concern in that regard was well-founded.

- [111] Also troubling is that the evidence now shows that Ms. H.'s partner - then and likely now - has in fact been physically violent with A.B., which Ms. H. failed to disclose and continues to minimize.
- [112] It is unknowable just what the dynamics in the H. household were from 2018 onward, as Ms. H. is not a reliable source of such information.
- [113] Continuing with the 2019 chart notes, Dr. S. writes:

Objective note: Initially happy and talkative, but when asked about visiting father became agitated/distressed and hid in the corner under a chair/kicked off his boots/pulled feet of chair - unwilling to talk about how he was feeling.

'Assessment note: Behavioral issues YYD. Appear to be triggered/worsened around custody tension and particularly around visiting father, though behavioral problems are ongoing. Anxiety likely a component.

(My emphasis.)

- [114] I note that A.B.'s behaviour here is not a reliable indicator of actual distress about his dad, since the evidence shows that Ms. H. discusses inappropriate topics with the child that cast his father in a negative light. I have regard for Ms. P.'s experience of her efforts to repair A.B.'s relationship with his father this spring being derailed in her view, and Ms. H.'s proximity to that derailing.

## (d) the December 18, 2019 psychiatric consult report

- [115] In late December 2019, paediatric psychiatrist Dr. Rosenauer authored a Consultation Report about A.B. She had received a copy of Dr. S.'s clinical notes, including the above-quoted references to spanking, corporal punishment and possible abuse - all at the hands of Mr. B., according to Ms. H.
- [116] It is Dr. Rosenauer who posits a working diagnosis of complex PTSD for A.B. (which as noted, Ms. P. did not agree with).
- [117] Dr. Rosenauer does not specifically identify just what the trauma is that she views as underpinning this provisional diagnosis. I note, however, that the information in

her possession relating to trauma in a violent setting is Ms. H.'s unchallenged description of Mr. B. spanking A.B. and A.B.'s apparent dysregulation upon broaching the topic of visiting with his dad. It may be that the upheaval in the child's living arrangements was also considered in arriving at this provisional diagnosis. Given that Dr. Rosenauer did not testify, that is unknowable.

[118] The information sources for the December 18, 2019 report include Ms. H. and A.B.; they do not include Mr. B.

[119] The report writer reflects that Ms. H. said that she and Mr. B. met at college. That was untrue: Ms. H. has not gone to college and that is not where the parties met. This is barely relevant to A.B.'s history, but it is an easily identifiable example of a stark untruthful 'fact' given by Ms. H. to a health professional trying to help A.B.

[120] Ms. H. told the psychiatrist that A.B. is '. . . aware that his father has been hiding assets and monies from his mother'. A.B. was not quite [omitted for publication] at the time of this consult. It is unlikely that his dad was telling the child about hiding assets when he had his parenting time with the child, given that that disclosure would seemingly put him in a negative light. I find the following more likely: either the child was not aware of such things or, if he was, Ms. H. was the source of that awareness. This is similar to her discussion with the children, as reflected in the s. 211 report discussed below, and as described by Ms. P., when A.B. 'growled' at her when she asked how he knew about adult matters.

[121] Ms. H. told the psychiatrist that Mr. B. was a sex addict and deceitful, which is different than what she said to the SHARE referral report writer; she did not allege that he was physically abusive.

[122] Dr. Rosenauer's report sets out what appear to be significant events in A.B.'s life. It refers to Mr. B.'s spanking as reflected in the GP notes Dr. Rosenauer had received. It is unclear whether Ms. H. actually repeated the allegation to the psychiatrist during the meeting, or whether Dr. Rosenauer was relying on Dr. S.'s records:

A.H. believes that A.B.'s behavioral concerns began when he was [omitted for publication] years old and after they had lived in [Mom's community] a few months. I understand eruptions began around the time when M. was visiting in [Dad's community] for a few days. By day three of the visit, I understand M. spanked A.B. I understand that at daycare when A.B. was given a direction he did not comply and became increasingly disruptive. If physical restraint was used in the daycare setting, A.B. would 'lose it.' If A.B. was hit or injured by another peer or person, he would respond strongly. A.B.'s meltdowns might occur twice per week around this time.

(My emphasis.)

- [123] Under 'Impression', the psychiatrist writes:

A.B. is a [omitted for publication] year old boy with a complicated social history. His family breakdown occurred early and there are suggestions that his relationship with parents is quite complicated. There is a family history with a number of persons who are reported to be markedly impacted by maladaptive interpersonal functioning.

It seems that he may have become overwhelmed after several adverse events which culminated in an encounter with this father at a time when he was trying to settle into a new community and establish himself with a peer group and daycare programme. To what extent subsequent encounters with his father are adding to his mental health burden is not entirely clear, however, the time line of events is consistent with A.B.'s behavioral and emotional progress and concerns as offered by information collected today . . .

. . . [respirodone]

At this point, A.B.'s profile might be seen as a complex PTSD with features of somatization likely related to strong emotional states . . .

(My emphasis.)

- [124] There is little doubt that Dr. Rosenauer includes Mr. B. (and perhaps only him) as being 'markedly impacted by maladaptive personal functioning'. Further, that there is a spectre of his 'adding to A.B.'s mental health burden' in her view. This all arises from Ms. H.'s reporting of injurious acts by A.B.'s dad and his dad's not refuting those allegations due to his being far away and unaware of them.
- [125] In addition to the allegations against Mr. B., it must be noted that the children's reality is that by now, Mr. W. has lived with them as a new father-figure for over a year. There is no mention at all of this significant change in the little boy's life in the report.

## (e) the December 14, 2021 psychiatric consult report

- [126] Dr. Rosenauer authored a CYMH Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Consultation Report arising from a consult with the parties: Ms. P.; A.B.'s school counsellor, support teacher; and principal. This is the meeting that occurred on December 14, 2021.
- [127] The report reflects Ms. H.'s reference to recent changes in A.B.'s behaviour, including increased violence in the home, and questions whether his medication should be changed or adjusted.

[128] By way of background, J.W. struck A.B. in October 2021 and Ms. H. knew this as of December 14. Despite this, Ms. H. did not disclose Mr. W.'s violence toward A.B. in the meeting; rather, she made references to the incident but in a way that cast blame on A.B.: she said that A.B. kicked the headrest of J.'s vehicle chair, rather than saying that J. slapped the child. She is recorded as stating: '[o]n one explosive occasion, A.B. kicked at J. while they waited'.

- [129] Knowing of Mr. W.'s violent act toward A.B. sheds light on Ms. H.'s recorded focus during the consultation. Ms. H. reports that physical aggression has decreased at school. However, she also reports:

At home, however, more outbursts are seen. A.H. offers examples of how A.B. hit A.H. and J. and how on other occasions A.B. might shout how he hates A.H. and how he hates himself. A.B. has had physical outbursts while waiting in the car for N. after school. . . .

- [130] There is then reference to a discussion of factors that might increase the risk of A.B.'s acting out. Notably, there is no reference to his being exposed to direct violence being one of those factors, despite his being the victim of family violence at the hands of his mother's partner.
- [131] L.P. testified to the effect that in her view it would have been in A.B.'s best interests if Ms. H. had disclosed that the child had recently been hit by J.W., during that December 14, 2021 meeting. That is without doubt.

## (f) development

- [132] Ms. P. testified that in observing A.B. at school, she concluded that he would benefit from 'dipping' in and out of the mainstream school system, as he was only interacting with other children with serious issues in the Field Program. She explained that she meant that he would benefit from spending time with kids who are more ageappropriate behavioural and developmental-wise. She had made two observations at the school and saw the other kids in the Field Program with A.B. She saw that they had challenging behaviours, with some kind of emotional or social difficulties; she saw A.B. left out on the playground.
- [133] She thought it good for him that he was in the mainstream program now.
- [134] She testified that, generally, A.B. operates at a developmental level of a [omitted for publication] year old; however, she observed him on several Zoom calls this summer while he was in [Dad's community] and she agreed that he appeared more ageappropriate. She noted that the calls were limited in duration. As mentioned, she was a balanced and careful witness.

## (g) physical activity - physical, emotional, and psychological well-being

- [135] In February 2019, the Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy report recommended that A.B. (like any [omitted for publication] year old) should have 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity daily. There is no reliable evidence that the child comes close to that when in Ms. H.'s care, or ever has.
- [136] Ms. M. testified that she was aware that there was a time when A.B. was trying out soccer, but that he has never been really into sports or extracurricular activities so far as she can remember. She said that his biggest interest was reading, and playing with his brother.
- [137] In cross-examination, Ms. P. testified that A.B. has never talked about going camping or bike riding with his mom, never about building a fort or going for a walk. Her impression is that the kids are more active in dad's care than in mom's.

[138] When asked what she agreed with in an email from Mr. B., Ms. P. testified that, given that A.B. is suspected of having ADHD, it is really important that he be active and that that is something that Mr. B. has been saying, often. She noted that she tries not to get drawn into agreeing with comments made against another parent, but here, there were certainly some things she thought were right.

[139] The December 18, 2019 consult report reflects that A.B. was then taking two mg of melatonin nightly. He has taken melatonin when at his mother's for years. Ms. H. described it as helping him get to sleep, but that he often wakes up in the night. Reports in evidence reflect him as being tired at school.

[140] He does not use melatonin at Mr. B.'s home and he is, on the evidence, more physically active there. A correlation between activity and sleep is likely.

[141] Ms. P. observed that A.B. appeared to have lost weight this summer having been in [Dad's community]. That said, she also said he appeared taller, and these changes may have been due to development.

[142] Mr. B. described A.B. as being overweight and attributes this to A.B.'s general inactivity in [Mom's community].

[143] I find on his unshaken testimony that Mr. B. encourages the children to engage in athletic activities and have social interaction with age-appropriate children, to their betterment.

[144] His testimony that A.B. successfully attended a weeklong day camp in [Dad's community] this past summer, capped by an overnight camping trip, successfully and without incident, was not shaken.

(ii) N.

[145] In her letter regarding N.'s cyclic vomiting of January 2021, Dr. Freedman states that treatment options focus on lifestyle interventions as well as medications; she identifies good sleep hygiene and regular exercise as being good for N.

- [146] In June 2021, N. told school staff that:

He lives with his mom, stepdad and older brother and that his dad lives in [Dad's community]. When not at school he said that he likes to play minecraft on his tablet and with Lego. He shared that he does not play any sports but that he can ride a bike with training wheels. He cannot swim and has never tried ice skating.

- [147] After diagnosing him with ADHD in late 2021, Dr. Kalaci wrote:

As with sleep, I have stressed the importance of regular exercise. Metaanalysis of exercise interventions showed improvement in core ADHD symptoms . . . Encourage physical activity before school if possible, like an early morning run with a parent or riding a bike to school if acceptable.

- [148] The recommendation in A.B.'s Occupational Therapy Report of February 2019 was a generalized recommendation for all children between the ages of 5 -11. Again, there is no reliable evidence that N. comes close to getting 60 minutes of moderate to intense exercise daily while in [Mom's community], or that the recommendations of Doctors Freedman and Kalaci have been implemented.
- [149] Mr. B. testified, unshaken, that when N. arrived at [Dad's community] this past summer, he had forgotten how to ride a bike and had to relearn that basic childhood skill.
- [150] N. was late 71 times in Grade [omitted for publication]. Mr. B. testified that the child said he was teased by peers and called 'N. the Late'. At one point, Ms. H.'s testimony was to the effect that N.'s being late related to her getting A.B. to school.
- [151] In one of the reports, Ms. H. is recorded as saying that N. lives in the 'chaos' of his brother.
- [152] N. is awaiting an assessment for autism.

## CONCLUSION RE: S. 37(2)(a)

- [153] A.B. has experienced 'extreme' emotional and behavioural dysregulation since late 2017. He has not been diagnosed with an underpinning organic cause and his

social history has been mis-described. While in [Mom's community], at least, he continues to have serious issues. His lifestyle here is largely sedentary, which is inconsistent with his best interests.

[154] N. also lives a far too sedentary life. His ADHD diagnosis is not well-served by that nor are his stomach issues. His social and physical development is less than what it should be. He is adversely impacted by Ms. H.'s inability to deal with his and A.B.'s needs, such that he has been chronically late for school and teased as a result.

## s. 37 (2)(b): the children's views, unless it would be inappropriate to consider them

## (a) the section 211 report - before the children's interview

- [155] On March 1, 2023, the court ordered a Views of the Child report be prepared regarding parenting time and primary residence of the children, and with regard to 'the possible scenario of N., only, having principle residence in [Dad's community]'.
- [156] The interview for the children was set for June 9, 2023, to take place in Ms. H.'s home.
- [157] About five weeks before that interview, Ms. H. told A.B. that Mr. B. recorded him without his knowledge.
- [158] Ms. H. testified that a few days after May 5, A.B. caught her off-guard by asking her a line of questioning about the issue of being recorded without consent. She testified that she told him, without thinking, 'You get recorded all the time up there, in [Dad's community].'
- [159] She said that she provided no specifics and realized that the children were not aware of being recorded and that 'then was not the right time' and that she apologized. She testified that she immediately backpedalled; she said that she told A.B.'s counsellor about her statement to him, as well as about the May 5 cord incident, at his counselling session later that day.

- [160] Ms. H. testified about a call between A.B. and his dad shortly after that disclosure, where A.B. was angry about his dad recording him. She testified that A.B. was angry on a few more phone calls with his dad, but that things between them resolved. She was aware that he had had some calls with his dad and his counsellor.
- [161] Mr. B. testified about his first telephone call with A.B. after Ms. H.'s disclosure; he recalled it being on May 5, after the cord incident. He described A.B. as being angry at him and saying that the recording was a breach of his privacy and if he was older, it would be illegal.
- [162] Without resolving the difference in the parties' evidence as to the exact date of Ms. H.'s statement to A.B. about his being 'recorded all the time up there,' there is no doubt that it was proximate to the s. 211 Views of the Child report interviews.
- [163] The evidence shows that Mr. B. recorded the children's Skype call with Ms. H. on January 7, 2022, or so. Ms. P. was aware of this, as he sent her a copy of the recording and she listened to it around the time that it was made. The fact of the recording was disclosed to Ms. H. in the context of this litigation. There is no evidence as to just when Ms. H. learned of the recording, but whenever that was, she had apparently, wisely and in their best interests, not told the children about it. However, she asks the court to accept that she inadvertently disclosed this fact to A.B. within weeks of the s. 211 Views of the Child interview, where the children would likely be describing their feelings about their parents in the context of the creation of evidence for this trial.
- [164] Mr. B. testified that his parenting time after May 5 (which was now by telephone rather than by Skype) was adversely impacted as a result of Ms. H. telling the child that he had recorded him.
- [165] A.B.'s upset at his dad, arising from his mom's disclosure of the recording, was confirmed by Ms. P. It was entirely predictable.

## (b) the section 211 report contents and inferences arising

[166] Mr. B. objected to the admission of the Section 211 Views of the Child report into evidence. He said that for the report to have any prospect of reliably reflecting the children's actual views, the children should have been interviewed at both parents' homes, not just at Ms. H.'s. He said that given her telling the kids about his recording the Skype call, his relationship with A.B., at least, was at an artificially low point at the time of the interview. Finally, he said that the content of the report supported the conclusion that Ms. H. had been coaching or influencing the children.

[167] His objection was not sustained, as the report has significant evidentiary value and the concerns raised by Mr. B. can, where appropriate, be dealt with by adjusting the weight to be given the particular content of the report. For example, I do find that his and A.B.'s relationship was likely not as positive as it usually is, as a result of Ms. H.'s telling the child about the Skype recording shortly before the interview. As a result, the weight I place on A.B.'s views that are negative about his dad is much less than it otherwise would be.

[168] Further, while I accept the report writer's explanation to Mr. B. that a report such as this is in effect a snapshot in time, in the unusual and unfortunate circumstances of this case, there is little doubt but that Ms. H. attempted to influence the children and likely coached them in anticipation of the interview at her home, such that that snapshot is distorted. That finding has significant impact on the evidentiary value of the report.

[169] The s. 211 Views of the Child report was written by an experienced justice counsellor. Her curriculum vitae is attached to the report. I have regard to not only her reporting of the children's statements and actions, but also to her contextual observations which she viewed as sufficiently significant to include in her report.

- [170] The s. 211 report contains the following:

[N.] reported his father 'has more fun stuff' at his home and they do fun activities, but he believes this is 'to make us want to live there.' N. initially stated his mother had told him this and then amended his answer saying he does not remember why he believes that.

[171] N.'s initial statement here appears to have been extemporaneous, from which I infer it likely to be the truth. His revision that he does not remember why he believes that his dad has more 'fun stuff' to make him and A.B. want to live with him is likely an attempt by the [omitted for publication] year old to deflect having to come up with a believable answer to a complex question. I think it is likely that N.'s initial answer is true.

## [172] The report continues on:

[N.] finds [Dad's community] okay while describing [Mom's community] as a great place because 'we live in a literal vacation spot.' He went on to describe in great detail [Dad's community] having a 'giant factory' and the concern that the single electric plant would cause the whole town to lose power if it stopped working. N. could not explain how he knew so much about these topics, stating, 'I just know'.

- [173] N. was [omitted for publication] at the time of the s. 211 interview. The phrase, 'a literal vacation spot' is unusual phrasing for an [omitted for publication] year-old boy, but parroting what he has overheard others say could explain that. The same could be said in relation to the negative descriptors about [Dad's community]; however, given that his only connection to that community is through his father and he is physically there for short periods, that seems less likely. As well, although asked what the source of his knowledge about [Dad's community] and [Mom's community] was, N. did not say. I note that it is clear from his earlier revision about his dad's having 'more fun stuff', that he was aware that attributing his views to his mom was not what he either wanted or was supposed to do.

[174] In all of the circumstances, I am satisfied that it is more likely than not that Ms. H. spoke to N .about the 'pros' of [Mom's community] and the 'cons' of [Dad's community], an issue directly related to this court proceeding.

- [175] Finally, N. is reported as saying:

. . . He thinks his father wants him and A.B. to live with him in [Dad's community] so he does not have to pay child support. N.'s father has not told him this and N. believes his father does not know he and A.B. are aware of this. He was not interested in answering any further specific questions about his father or his household.

[176] Child-support issues are not a topic that a party to family litigation should be talking about with children. The negative 'spin' implicit in this statement in relation to Mr. B. and his motives relating to the children and his financial obligations is completely inappropriate and unhealthy. The topic is further reflected by the statement attributed to A.B., below:

. . . [A.B.] believes his father does not care about him and N. and provided the example of his father 'cutting off the money' as proof. When asked how he knew this, A.B. became angry and stated he 'pieced it together' when it became apparent his mother had less money to spend. He believes his father is focused on winning and is waging a 'one sided war' against his mother. . . .

[177] On the evidence, I am satisfied that Ms. H. spoke with the children before the s. 211 report interview occurred about matters relating to questions under consideration by the court, including possible living arrangements as between [Mom's community] and [Dad's community].

[178] Thus, I find it likely that Ms. H. intentionally told A.B. about the Skype recording shortly before the section 211 interview would take place in an effort to destabilize his relationship with, or view, of his dad. Further, I find that she coached the children discussed topics which she expected would be the subject of the s. 211 interview - as set out above.

[179] I put no weight on A.B.'s statement that he would feel sad and crazy if he lived with his dad full time. I note that the report reflects A.B.'s stating that his dad 'forced[d]' him to report an incident with J. to the police which he now describes as 'terrifying and traumatic'. These statements relate to the same events which Ms. P. described A.B.'s understanding were appropriate steps, back in early 2022.

[180] The report reflects A.B. saying that S.'s behaviour is 'horrifying' and that the best part of visiting in [Dad's community] is his little sister, A. I note the evidence of the children's interaction with their dad and their extended family in [Dad's community] this past summer and how positive it appeared to be, based on Mr. B.'s unshaken testimony and Ms. P.'s limited observations.

- [181] I find that much of the negative content of the report is likely the bi-product of influence by Ms. H.

## CONCLUSION RE: S. 37(2)(b)

- [182] Given the foregoing, I do not find that it is appropriate to consider the children's views as set out in the s. 211 report, which I find has been corrupted by influence and coaching on the part of Ms. H.

## s. 37(2)(c): the nature and strength of the child's relationships and significant persons in their lives

## (i)  in [in Mom's community]

- [183] The evidence shows that the children's relationships in [Mom's community] are with Ms. H., their maternal grandmother, and J.W. Despite the volume of evidence in this case, there is a dearth of reference to the children having friends; Ms. H.'s report of A.B. having two close friends, found in the December 14, 2021 consult record, is notable. They also have extended family in the Vancouver Lower Mainland with whom they interact.
- [184] Ms. H. testified to having a close relationship with both children, noting their different affection styles. I accept her evidence here.
- [185] Ms. P. testified that A.B. has a very, very close relationship with Ms. H. She described them as very affectionate; that he often sits on her lap; that she saw lots of cuddles. She also described Ms. H.'s taking issue with her when Ms. P. raised the topic of A.B.'s engaging in baby-talk, likely in 2021. She noted that Ms. H. brought the child to sessions at her [omitted for publication] office, wearing a onesie with ears.
- [186] Ms. P. also described Ms. H. as understanding and having been a really strong advocate for A.B.'s problems. She has seen her explain clearly and appropriately to A.B. when there has been a challenge.
- [187] Ms. P. testified that A.B. appeared to be more aligned with Ms. H. In reexamination, Ms. P. testified that A.B. knew all about Mr. B.'s stopping support

payments. He told her that they do not have money for sandwiches and extra things. She said that when she asked him how he knew about this because it is an adult topic, he was quick to growl: 'Whose side are you on? his or hers?'

[188] Ms. H.'s telling A.B. that Mr. B. records him was unnecessary and predictably destructive. In the same vein, Ms. P. testified that she thought it likely that Ms. H. sabotaged her efforts to repair the negative impact caused by the disclosure, so far as A.B.'s and his dad's relationship was concerned.

[189] Ms. P. testified that Ms. H. should have disclosed Mr. W.'s current role in the children's lives; that this would be consistent with A.B.'s well-being. I agree.

[190] Thus, I find that the nature of A.B.'s relationship with Ms. H. is complex. There is no doubt that it is close and loving in some ways, but there is also no doubt that the relationship is not entirely healthy, and I find - based on the evidence relating to his development and care - that she holds him back from developing as he might otherwise, and as well, adversely impacts his relationship with his dad and stepmother, which is profoundly contrary to his best interests, even if she does not understand that.

[191] Turning to their maternal grandmother, according to Ms. H., the children see her mom on Sundays for 'pancake breakfast', where they have sugary cereal and likely play on the trampoline Ms. H. said her mom had bought. She described the kids as loving her mom. A.B.'s spending time with his grandma is confirmed in the s. 211 Views of the Child report, with him noting that he does not like staying overnight because she is not always understanding of his emotions.

[192] Turning to Mr. W., assessing the nature and strength of the children's relationship with him based on the evidence, is difficult: On Ms. H.'s testimony, he is with them daily, in their home for hours, buying groceries and making dinner; according to her, they view him as a stepfather. However, I find it likely that the relationship is complicated by his hitting A.B., which has generated conflict for A.B. with his own dad, as well as between his parents, of which A.B. is almost certainly aware.

[193] A.B. told the recent s. 211 report writer that he does not feel afraid of him, acknowledging that they had struggled in the past, but that it got better.

[194] I have regard to A.B.'s not talking about Mr. W.'s involvement in his life during counselling. I have regard to N.'s telling the s. 211 Views of the Child writer that he did not want to 'explain who [J.] was'. I note the January 7, 2022 order remains, requiring him to leave Ms. H.'s home by January 8, 2022. Given the evidence of Ms. H.'s discussing inappropriate topics with the children, it is likely that they are aware of the order. These are complex matters for children.

[195] Ms. H. testified about the children's time spent with her brother and extended family from the mainland, particularly with her brother, whom she described their being close to; it all sounds positive.

## (ii) in [Dad's community]

[196] The children's primary relationships in [Dad's community] are with Mr. B. and his wife S., and their sister A. Mr. B. testified, as well, about their relationship with his parents; S.'s mother; S.'s aunt and uncle; and A.B.'s friend V.

[197] If the negative comments about Mr. B. and S. attributed to the children in the s. 211 Views of the Child report were worthy of any weight, they would be relevant to the assessment and strength of the relationships engaged in here. However, they are not worthy of weight, but they disclose reason to conclude that the nature of the children's relationship with their father and stepmother, in particular, has been adversely complicated by Ms. H.'s inappropriate and unhealthy influence.

[198] That said, I have regard to Ms. P.'s evidence of A.B.'s telling his dad impromptu, 'I love you,' at the end of the call where she was trying to repair the damage caused by Ms. H.'s telling the child that his dad recorded him 'all the time'. A.B. said this to his father when outside of Ms. H.'s sphere of influence and I am satisfied that it is an indicator of the true state of the child's feelings for his father.

[199] In contrast, the report reflects A.B.'s saying, 'I like my dad but . . .' and then indicating he did not want to complete his sentence. It reflects his saying that he acts differently in [Dad's community] because he is scared about his father's reactions, when the topic of his behaviour in [Dad's community] - different than his behaviour in [Mom's community] - was squarely before the court.

[200] In the report, N. is noted as saying that:

[He] likes his little sister but was less willing to share his feelings about his father and stepmother S. He does not get along with S., but he could not articulate why. N. took a moment away from the camera to pet his cats. When he returned, he stated S. tried 'to encourage A.B. to hate my mom.'

[201] Mr. B. suspects that while off camera, the child was provided the reason he gave for not getting along with S. when he returned to the camera.

[202] A.B. is noted as saying that he did not want to 'provide details about S.' and indicated that 'her behaviour towards him was worse than his father calling it 'horrifying.''

[203] He said that the best part of visiting his father in [Dad's community] is his little sister, A.

[204] Contrasted against the striking negativity in the s. 211 Views of the Child report is Mr. B.'s testimony about the good times the children have with these people in [Dad's community]: weekend pool barbeques at his parents' home and the children having one-on-one sleepovers there; A.B.'s connecting with S.'s aunt over cats and going with her for tea; A.B. and S.'s connecting over the shared experience of being children of divorced parents.

[205] The 2017 full s. 211 report, while dated, provides the only objective evidence about the children's relationship with their paternal grandparents and now-stepmom. Given the state of the current evidence, it has value despite its date. In that report, after observing the children with S., Mr. B. and his parents, the writer records:

The boys relate well to their paternal grandparents and sought S. out for assistance when she was the closest in proximity.

[206] This is consistent with Mr. B.'s description, particularly with regard to his parents, who are retired and supportive.

[207] Again, looking for objective, reliable evidence, I note that photos in evidence show the boys looking happy and relaxed with their dad and contrast this with the negativity in the report discussed above.

[208] As to the nature of the children's relationship with their father, I find it likely that when not adversely impacted, it is a healthy parent/child relationship. I note Ms. P.'s observation that during the Zoom sessions she had with A.B. while at his dad's, he presents very differently; he presents as age-appropriate. When asked how to reconcile this, she noted that they are very short Zoom sessions in the middle of the summer. She agreed that it does seem to be the case that A.B. acts differently when in his dad's care than when in his mom's.

[209] I note that one of the photos in evidence is of three children in the summertime, smiling, standing together closely at a trailhead: two boys and a girl. The tallest of the boys has one hand on the little girl's shoulder; his other hand is touching the other smaller boy. This is A.B., N. and A. They all look happy.

## CONCLUSION RE: S. 37(2)(c)

[210] The reliable evidence establishes that the children love both their parents and that both their parents love them. It also shows that their relationship with Mr. B. has likely been adversely impacted by Ms. H. Given Ms. P.'s description of A.B. during the first two Skype calls with his dad after Ms. H.'s disclosure about the recording, I am satisfied that the children's relationship with Mr. B. will be strengthened when this adverse influence is reduced.

[211] While I accept that the children have good relationships with their extended family in the lower mainland, it appears that that interaction is not frequent, given

logistics. I find that their maternal grandmother is an important person in their lives. I have found that their relationship with Mr. W. involves complexities. The nature of their relationship with Ms. H. is not always consistent with their development.

[212] I am satisfied that the nature of their relationship with their dad is consistent with their appropriate development.

[213] The children have more, and more involved, supportive extended family in [Dad's community], and they have a sibling there, who they are both able to express fondness for, even in the face of Ms. H.'s coaching.

## s. 37(2)(d): the history of care

[214] Under the 2016 separation agreement, the children have lived with Ms. H. since mid-2016. [Mom's community] is where they have done all of their schooling and growing up, since they were little.

[215] From sometime in 2018 until early 2022, Mr. W. also lived with them. After A.B.'s disclosure to his dad in late December 2021 that Mr. W. struck him, Mr. W. moved out pursuant to court order. Ms. H. testified that she is not in a romantic relationship with Mr. W. currently, but he buys them groceries and makes her and the boys' dinner every night; he is at the house daily but does not stay overnight.

[216] I note that Ms. P. testified that Ms. H. had told her, after January 2022, that she wanted to maintain a relationship with Mr. W.

[217] In the Views of the Child report, N. is reported to have said that 'someone' cleaned his room recently. When asked if his mom cleaned his room, he replied it was J., but 'he did not want to explain who J. was beyond stating 'I like him''.

[218] On all of the evidence, it is likely that Mr. W. is part of the mix of A.B. and N.'s care with Ms. H.

[219] Mr. B. has cared for the boys for a month or so each summer, since May 2018, and a week at Christmas and spring break.

## CONCLUSION RE: S. 37(2)(d)

[220] There is no doubt that the children's history of care has been largely with their mom in [Mom's community]. I have considered this reality carefully in arriving at the relocation decision here: to change this is a weighty thing.

[221] I also find it likely that the children's history of care has included J.W.'s significant involvement, despite the January 7, 2022 order and despite Ms. H.'s not mentioning it to those directly engaged in supporting A.B.'s emotional well-being.

[222] Mr. B.'s care of the children has been significantly limited due to geographic realities and the terms of the separation agreement, for the years since the parties separated; the longest duration that he has cared for the children has been five weeks this past summer.

[223] Despite the other issues and findings in this case, I find that such a history of consistent care with one parent is a factor to be weighed heavily against the prospect of disruption. Here, I have regard to the constancies of the children's lives and experiences; their familiarity with their community, their home; their love of their mom and their relationship with her based on years of living with her and being loved by her. I discount none of this.

## s. 37(2)(e): the children's need for stability, given their age and stage of development

[224] Ms. M. testified to A.B.'s need for stability and his dysregulating upon change while he was her student in Grades [omitted for publication]. Since then, he has transitioned through the Field Program to the normal school stream. As noted, Ms. P. testified to the effect that such change would be good for him.

[225] Dr. Kalaci, A.B.'s current paediatrician, stated that A.B. has reached puberty.

[226] While stability is a significant factor for any child, given his stage of development, physical and social activity are likely of increasing importance to A.B.'s well-being. He

will be a teenager shortly, with all the social challenges that that entails, and has a narrow window to attain physical and emotional skills which he currently lacks.

[227] Ms. P. described his emotional state as being immature when with Ms. H. She testified that there did appear to be a difference when the child was with his dad.

[228] I have regard to the evidence relating to Ms. H.'s viewing A.B.'s baby-talk as acceptable; to his wearing onesies in public; to his being able to leave school by putting a window blind cord on his neck; to the evidence about his manipulating situations - to intentional clumsiness, learned helplessness, and the cord-incidents being something other than serious suicidal ideation, and conclude that given his age and stage of development, a shift in environment and parenting will be in his best interests.

[229] I note the unchallenged testimony of Mr. B., that when A.B. and N. arrived to him this past summer, neither could tie their shoelaces and that N. could no longer ride a bike.

[230] As well, while Ms. H. testified that she has 'zero tolerance' for violence in her house, she also testified that A.B. is sometimes violent toward N. there. There is no evidence that N. experiences this when at Mr. B.'s. As noted in medical documents and by the parties, A.B. is getting bigger and he will be getting stronger.

[231] In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the need for stability outweighs the children's need to develop at a rate different than attainable with Ms. H.

## s. 37(2)(f): the ability of each person who is a guardian . . . to exercise his or her responsibilities

[232] Ms. H. has been, largely, unable to exercise her parenting responsibilities in conjunction with the children's father as required by the separation agreement. Clause 6 of the agreement provides that the parties must 'both consult the other about any important decisions that must be made regarding the children and try to reach agreement concerning those important decisions'. The evidence shows that Ms. H. has been unable, or unwilling, to comply with this clause, and her actions have created discord between the parties, contrary to the children's best interests.

43

[233] A striking example is Ms. H.'s decision to put [omitted for publication] year-old A.B. on the antipsychotic drug risperidone - without consulting Mr. B. As well, she alone decided when the children would return to school after COVID-19 closures. She, alone, decided to change the children's paediatrician from Dr. Freedman to Dr. Kalaci (it was Dr. Freedman who found 'no overarching neurodevelopmental' diagnosis). Ms. H. sought a change in counsellor, from the qualified and even-keeled Ms. P., without Mr. B.'s input.

[234] As she said in evidence, she 'informed' Mr. B. about significant decisions impacting the children.

[235] In this application, she seeks an order excluding Mr. B.'s participation at meetings between her and professionals relating to the children. The bases for this include her assertion that Mr. B. has mistreated her during such meetings.

[236] Mr. B. denies this.

[237] Ms. P. testified that there have been three (or maybe four) joint Zoom meetings with the parents and that Mr. B. has made it easy to schedule and that he has not been rude or aggressive to Ms. H. during these meetings. She described Mr. B. as usually subdued, except in the one meeting when it got tense during discussion of Mr. W.'s violence toward A.B. She said that Ms. H. has asked that Mr. B. not be included in the meetings; that they be separate meetings. Ms. P. testified to the effect that from the perspective of counselling goals in A.B.'s interests, joint meetings were preferable in her view.

[238] As discussed, Ms. H. has provided inaccurate information about A.B. to education and health professionals in Mr. B.'s absence, which was inconsistent with A.B.'s best interests.

[239] N.'s being chronically late is a relevant concern here as well, as are the weeks of school absences.

[240] The sedentary lifestyle the children lead while in Ms. H.'s care is contrary to the professionals' recommendations.

[241] Mr. B. testified that he has always wanted to be involved in the children's lives and that when they are in his care, he provides active, organized days for the children. I have considered Ms. H.'s allegations of Mr. B.'s actions around the time of the parties' separation and find that none of it has any bearing, at all, on his current abilities to exercise his responsibilities in relation to the children.

## CONCLUSION RE: S. 37(2)(f)

[242] As noted by Ms. P., cooperation in parenting is in the children's best interests; Ms. H. has been consistently unwilling or unable to engage in meaningful consultation with the children's dad about significant matters relating to them. Her explanation that this arises from his mistreatment of her carries no weight.

[243] The children have been impacted by her exercise of her responsibilities, as set out above.

[244] There is no reliable evidence establishing any concern as to Mr. B.'s ability to exercise his responsibilities.

s. 37(2)(g): the impact of any family violence on the child's safety, security or well-being, whether it is directed toward the child or another family member

## (i)  J.W. towards A.B.

## (a) A.B.'s disclosure: December 2021

[245] Mr. B. testified that during their 2021 Christmas visit, A.B. told him that J.W. had 'attacked' him and struck him in October. This was the first Mr. B. had heard of the incident, despite having been at the December 14, 2021 meeting, along with Ms. H., where possible reasons for A.B.'s increased violence at home were discussed.

[246] The disclosure arose in the context of Mr. B.'s following up on Ms. H.'s stating (during that December 14, 2021 psychiatric consult) that A.B. had kicked the back of

J.'s headrest while they were in the car; Mr. B. was addressing that behaviour with A.B. during their Christmas visit. He testified that A.B. replied by saying that 'that wasn't how it was at all,' and referred to J. attacking him and 'all this abuse'.

[247] I find that the evidence establishes that an incident of violence occurred as disclosed by A.B.

[248] A record of the psychiatric consultation that occurred in March 2022 reflects that while in Ms. H.'s presence, Mr. B. described A.B.'s disclosing that he had been hit by J. and that he would 'hide' at Ms. H.'s home when J. was 'in a mood'.

[249] Mr. B. testified that upon the initial disclosure in December 2021, he confirmed what A.B. was telling him, allowing for some confusion on the child's part. Once clarified, he testified that he said 'Okay, that means you were abused. I'm going to have to do something about it.' He described it as being 'the worst timing' - there being delays with MCFD, the police. He was supposed to return the children to Ms. H. under the terms of the May 2018 order at the end of the week, but the reporting process was not completed. Text messages in evidence show that he sought input from Ms. P., A.B.'s then-counsellor, about how to deal with the disclosure and resulting issues.

[250] Mr. B. testified that he did not force A.B. to talk to the police about the W. incident; that he had a duty to report it and that A.B. was not scared to talk to the police.

## (b) January 7, 2022

[251] The parties were in court on January 5 and 7, 2022 before the Honourable Judge Challenger, relating to the return of the children. The appearances resulted in Judge Challenger's order that Mr. W. leave the H. home and the children return to it.

[252] Mr. B. testified that Judge Challenger urged him to ensure that the children had a Skype call with their mom that night. He also testified that Ms. H. was dysregulated and in an emotional state during that court appearance, such that he was concerned about just what she would say to the children. In any event, the ensuing Skype call is the call he recorded surreptitiously.

[253] While the recording was not put into evidence, he and Ms. P. testified to his forwarding the recording to Ms. P. and Ms. P. testified to listening to it and hearing A.B. tell Ms. H. he is afraid of Mr. W., or words to this effect. This is confirmed in text messages between Ms. P. and Mr. B.

[254] Mr. B. testified that as soon as the kids returned to [Dad's community], A.B. began challenging what he had done, saying it was wrong; that A.B. would yell at him; the Skyping ended. Ms. H. installed a phone line in February 2022 and there was no more Skype between the children and Mr. B.

[255] Ms. P. confirmed conflict arising shortly after A.B.'s return to [Mom's community]: that A.B. blamed himself for J.W. being gone, and then began to blame his dad.

[256] When the second psychiatric consult occurred on March 8, 2022, Mr. B. wanted the possible impact of Mr. W.'s violence to be considered in relation to A.B.'s violent behaviour.

## (c) Ms. H.'s actions

[257] Ms. H. testified that on the day of the incident, A.B. and J. returned to the house. A.B. came in; she said that Mr. W. did not. A.B. was very angry at J. She said that he did not disclose anything for about 20 minutes, but then said that 'J. slapped me'. She testified that it was odd that it took A.B. so long to say that and that his response was not like how he has responded to being hit by another child at school - where he talked about it a lot after it happened. She said that she told him that there is no excuse for an adult to touch a child like that. While she described it as a 'non-incident', she also testified that Mr. W. has not been alone with A.B. since.

[258] Ms. H. did not tell A.B.'s CYMH counsellor about it. She testified that she did not tell Ms. P. about it because 'her interpretation of that day was very different'.

[259] She testified that she did not disclose the incident during the December 14, 2021 consult with Dr. Rosenauer and others because she did think that it was the right 'venue' for the topic. What she meant by that was not clear.

[260] Ms. H. testified that A.B. did not tell her that he felt afraid of J.W. She did, however, testify that he has said that he is afraid of Mr. B.; that he does not remember what happened with J.; and his dad would not leave him alone about it; that he eventually just agreed with Mr. B. and S.

[261] As discussed, both Ms. P. and Mr. B. testified that the child did in fact tell his mom that he was afraid of J., or words to that effect, during the Skype conversation with her on or about January 7, 2022. I prefer their evidence in this regard.

[262] Ms. H.'s description of Mr. B.'s contacting the police and MCFD after A.B. told Mr. B. about being struck by Mr. W. minimizes the reality that a child was struck by an adult:

After the incident where Mr. B. got A.B. to file a charge against Mr. W., I cooperated with the Ministry and the RCMP and the Ministry confirmed that they took no issue with Mr. W., and I didn't have A.B. with Mr. W. until L.P. decided A.B. was actually comfortable with it. . . .

(My emphasis.)

[263] She also testified that A.B. has not been alone with Mr. W. '. . . since the allegation that Mr. B. brought forward'.

[264] As discussed, Mr. W. is back in the children's daily lives.

## (d) A.B.'s response

[265] Ms. P. testified that when A.B. returned from [Dad's community] in January 2022, J. was gone from the family home and that A.B. felt responsible for his departure. She observed the child shift from blaming himself to blaming his dad.

[266] She testified that initially he had accepted that by law, his dad had to disclose J.'s hitting him and that Ms. H. told him that his dad did what he had to do, but that over time, A.B. became more and more rigid around the belief that his dad had pulled it out of him and twisted his words and became very blaming towards his dad.

[267] Ms. P. said that the Skype calls between A.B. and his dad became very difficult and that the children's visit to [Dad's community] for spring break 2022 did not occur. Ms. P. observed that this meant that when the 2022 summer trip to [Dad's community] was approaching, A.B. had had very little contact with his dad since the last time he was in [Dad's community] - that Christmas of 2022 - when the 'small 't' trauma' occurred; not even Skype calls.

[268] To address this situation, Ms. P. made arrangements for some Skype calls between A.B. and Mr. B. in the spring of 2022, to facilitate some relationship repair before A.B.'s summer trip to his dad's. A.B. agreed to participate in the calls on the condition that his dad 'not lecture him'.

[269] Ms. P. described the first two Skype calls going 'really well'. She set it up so that A.B. and Mr. B. could play chess. At the end of the second Skype call, A.B. ended the call with, 'I love you dad.' At the beginning of the second Skype call, A.B. told her he was really glad he was working on his relationship with his dad.

[270] Ms. P. testified that the third session where A.B. was set to Skype with his dad was completely different from the first two. Ms. P. described A.B.'s attending her office for the third call in 'a completely bizarre mood, ping-ponging down the hall, all the way'. He was saying that his dad is a liar and that S. is a horrible person, or words to that effect.

[271] Ms. P. described saying, 'What? You had these two great sessions . . .' and A.B.'s being unable to do the third Skype session.

[272] Ms. P. testified that after she suggested that they cancel the Zoom call, A.B. calmed down and asked to say sorry to his dad.

[273] She said that his behaviour was striking in contrast to the week before.

[274] In a text message to Mr. B., Ms. P. referred to 'parental alienation' in relation to these events. She resiled from that description in court; however, she testified to feeling frustrated and said that she felt that she was being sabotaged in her efforts of repair.

She observed that the only sensible explanation to her was that Ms. H. had talked with A.B.; that they had a 30-minute car ride to her office. She opined that A.B. is more aligned with Ms. H. She testified that she believes that things get talked about and A.B. takes things in a way not intended by the parent.

[275] As stated, I have concluded that Ms. H. spoke with the children about the s. 211 Views of the Child report and sought to influence them. She has discussed with them legal matters such as financial-support payments. All in all, I share Ms. P.'s concern and find it likely that Ms. H.'s influence adversely impacted the reparation of A.B. and Mr. B.'s relationship, which had been adversely impacted by Mr. B.'s appropriate steps to deal with Mr. W.'s violence toward A.B.

[276] I note that in the recent section 211 Views of the Child report, A.B. describes his dad as 'forcing' him to report Mr. W.'s violence.

## (ii) A.B.'s violence toward N. and Ms. H.

[277] Ms. H. testified to A.B.'s being violent in the home, making particular reference to an incident over Christmas 2022, when he pinned her down and punched and pinched her. She did not say whether N. was home during that incident.

[278] She testified that A.B. occasionally has altercations where he will pinch N.; that sometimes he will lash out and punch him.

[279] Ms. H. testified that there is 'zero tolerance' for violence in her home and that if the behaviour continues, A.B. will lose something of value, like a stuffy, or cat, or not be able to play videogames.

## (iii) Ms. H.'s allegations of Mr. B.'s physical violence toward A.B.

[280] A conclusion that Mr. B. has been physically violent toward the children would obviously be significant; however, as discussed in assessing Ms. H.'s credibility, I have concluded that her allegations in this regard are unfounded.

## (iv) Mr. B.'s physical abuse of Ms. H.

[281] Similarly, exposure to family violence between the parties is also relevant here.

[282] Again, while Ms. H. has alleged such behaviour on Mr. B.'s part, I have concluded that such allegation was unfounded and not relevant to the children's wellbeing; this is also considered in the discussion of Ms. H.'s credibility, above.

## (v)  A.B.'s bruises

[283] Ms. H. testified about A.B.'s returning from his 2021 spring break trip to [Dad's community] with significant bruising on his arms.

[284] She produced email messages between her and Mr. B. from March 2021 about the topic. Mr. B. writes that A.B. got the bruises 'horse playing' with his grandpa. Ms. H. wrote that the child had told her that the bruises were caused by his grandpa 'punching him repeatedly'.

[285] Her testimony about what A.B. said to her on the topic is not reliable evidence, nor is her email message about it.

[286] Mr. B. testified that this issue had been dropped until A.B. told him about Mr. W.'s violence.

[287] There is no other evidence relating to the possibility of A.B.'s paternal grandfather engaging in family violence with either child.

## CONCLUSION RE: S. 37(2)(g)

[288] I find that it is likely that J.W., who was at the time Ms. H.'s common-law partner, struck A.B. in October 2021. Further, that it is likely that he has engaged in other behaviour that left A.B. feeling unsafe at times, and with a need to 'hide,' at least as of early 2022.

[289] I find it likely that A.B.'s violence toward N. is more extreme than what might be expected between young siblings when rough housing or expressing passing anger, given the evidence relating to A.B.'s dysregulated behaviour.

[290] I do not find that:

- (i)  Mr. B. spanked or was physically violent with A.B. despite Ms. H.'s allegations;
- (ii)  the parties' relationship ended as a result of Mr. B. being physically violent with Ms. H. nor that he was, in fact, physically violent with her;
- (iii) A.B.'s paternal grandfather engaged in family violence.

## s. 37(2)(h):whether the actions of a person responsible for family violence indicate that the person may be impaired in the person's ability to care for the child and meet the child's needs

[291] I discuss this factor in relation to Mr. W., only: While Ms. H. testified that Mr. W. has taken a course called 'Dad's Matter', there is a no reliable evidence about his ability to care for the children, so far as violence goes. Of course, on Ms. H.'s evidence, he is not a 'family member' within the meaning of the FLA , and so 'family violence' does not quite fit, despite his proximity to the children daily.

[292] Ms. P. had told Mr. B. back in early 2022 that she was of the view that Ms. H. could protect the children. This pre-dated Mr. W.'s return to their daily lives, without disclosure.

[293] As discussed in reference to s. 38 of the FLA , below, Ms. H.'s failure to report the October 2021 incident and her focusing on A.B.'s actions, rather than Mr. W.'s, is relevant here.

## s. 37(2) (i): the appropriateness of an arrangement that would require the guardians' cooperation . . .

[294] As mentioned above, the parties frequently disagree about the appropriate approach to take to the parenting of their children.

[295] Despite the 2016 separation agreement stating that the parties would share parenting responsibilities under s. 41 of the FLA and would consult on important matters concerning the children and try to reach agreement, by 2017, Ms. H. took a different approach: The full 2017 section 211 report includes:

A.H. does not consider M. as a viable option for co-parenting and therefore relies on her extended family as back-up for childcare and a sounding board for strategies around parenting . . . [page 6]

[296] The most striking example of her approach to co-parenting and disregard for Mr. B.'s participation in decision making about important issues impacting the children is found in the psychiatrist's notes of December 18, 2019, describing Ms. H.'s decision to place [omitted for publication] year-old A.B. on the antipsychotic medication discussed above.

[297] Mr. B. learned that A.B. was on risperidone when the bill for the drugs came through on his extended medical.

[298] The Views of the Child Report reflects Ms. H. now saying that 'M. is . . . not willing to work cooperatively to provide their sons with a cohesive approach to parenting'.

[299] I note that part of the relief sought here by Ms. H. is an order that Mr. B. not be permitted to attend joint meetings with her and others involved in the well-being of their children; she cites his mistreatment of her at such meetings.

[300] Ms. P. addressed this in her testimony: she testified to the effect that, apart from some tension during the March 8, 2022 psychiatric consult where Mr. B. raised the issue of J.W. assaulting A.B., there was no issue of moment in having the parties participate together. She testified that Mr. B. always made himself available and was respectful.

[301] Further, she testified that she viewed attaining some level of cooperation between the parents was in A.B.'s best interests, so she encouraged joint meetings.

## CONCLUSION RE: S. 37(2)(i)

[302] Ms. H.'s assertion that Mr. B. treated her badly at joint meetings is reflective of her disinclination to work together and is contrary to reliable evidence. I find that it is consistent with the finding that an arrangement requiring their cooperation is likely inappropriate.

## s. 37(2)(j): any civil or criminal proceeding relevant to the child's safety, security or well-being

[303] This factor is irrelevant.

## Section 38

[304] As to the nature and seriousness of Mr. W.'s violence toward A.B. in October, 2021, a slap or any such violent forceful touch by an adult upon a child is serious (see: s. 38(a)).

[305] In the s. 211 Views of the Child report, A.B. is reported as saying he is not afraid of Mr. W. now. This is consistent with there being no recent violence; however, as noted, much of that report is worthy of little or no weight. That said, Ms. H. and Mr. W. now know that Mr. B. will act appropriately if either child is exposed to violence. Given this, I find it likely that after the children's return to Ms. H. in January 2022, there has been no more family violence (see: s. 38(b)).

[306] With regard to an assessment of the frequency of such family violence, I have regard to A.B.'s reference to 'hid[ing]' when J. was in 'a mood' and to feeling unsafe when Mr. W. was in their home back in early 2022. This evidence is consistent with Mr. W.s' violent behaviour in October 2021 not being isolated.

[307] Further, the evidence shows that Ms. H. was aware of the incident at the time but did not inform any of the many people supporting A.B.; this raises the spectre of other unreported violent incidents.

[308] I am satisfied that it is likely that the incident on October 2021 was not the first time A.B. was exposed to family violence involving Mr. W.; the actual frequency is unknowable on the evidence (see: s. 38(c)).

[309] There is no evidence with regard to subsections 38(d) or (f).

- [310] The violence in October 2021 was clearly directed at A.B. (see: s. 38 (e)).

[311] As noted at the outset, Mr. W. began living with the children and Ms. H. in 2018. His involvement in A.B.'s life is proximate in time to the onset of A.B.'s dysregulating; Ms. H. made no mention of Mr. W.'s presence in their home that is reflected in the documentation of late 2018. Troubling and relevant to A.B.'s emotional well-being is his mother's description at the December 14, 2021 psychiatric consult of his escalating violence at home, with actual references to his actions in the car (as in kicking the back of J.'s seat), without reference to J.'s violence toward her child - which occurred (see: s. 38(g)).

[312] I have taken the above into account in considering subsections 37(2)(g) and (h), above.

## F. CONSIDERATION OF OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE FLA

[313] I have concluded that, on all of the trial evidence, there has been a change in the children's needs such that their best interests will be served by the variation of the 2018 Order as ordered on November 1, 2023 (see: s. 47 of the FLA ).

[314] Turning to subsection 69(4)(a)(i) of the FLA , it is clear on the evidence that the relocation proposed by Mr. B. is made in good faith. I do not share Ms. H.'s view that his application for the children to live with him is motivated by money. I found his testimony that the children are not currently thriving to be accurate and compelling.

[315] Further, with regard to the factors set out in subsection 69(6) of the FLA, I find that the reason for the proposed move is that it is anticipated to be consistent with the children's best interests; that it will likely enhance the general quality of their lives, including their increased emotional well-being and physical well-being. Notice is not a

factor here. While the separation agreement provides for the children to reside in [Mom's community], as discussed, I have found that that restriction is contrary to their best interests (see: s. 37(3)).

[316] With regard to subsection 69(4)(a)(ii), it requires that I be satisfied that Mr. B. has proposed reasonable and workable arrangements to preserve the relationship between the children and Ms. H. On this point, I note that he seeks an order that the children be permitted to fly using the Unaccompanied Minors' Program, which will reduce travel expenses incurred for parenting time. As well, he testified that he was agreeable to meeting Ms. H. halfway, driving.

[317] There is no reliable evidence of Mr. B. unreasonably preventing contact between their children and their mom when in his care. I am satisfied on all the evidence that such arrangements are consistent with his overall approach to the children's well-being.

## G. DISCUSSION OF THE CASE LAW AND THE FACTS HERE

[318] The court in Barendregt sets out other factors, in addition to those under s. 37(2) of the FLA , that must be considered in a case where relocation is an issue. I turn to those now.

##  the reasons for the relocation

[319] The reason for the children's relocation is singular: to provide them with a healthier, more active environment, with nearby extended family, with a primary caregiver who can be expected to provide accurate and fulsome information about their states and situations to involved professionals, with a view to them thriving, with no risk of violence.

##  the impact of the relocation on the child

[320] Given the history of care and their close relationship with Ms. H., I am satisfied that the impact of the relocation will be significant on both children. Ms. H. will play a significant role in supporting this transition and reducing possible negative experiences. This has been addressed by terms of the conduct order made November 1. That said, I

have concluded that Mr. B. and his family have the skills and motivation to help reduce negative impact and that the benefits of this move significantly outweigh any adverse impact.

-  the amount of time spent with the child by each person who has parenting time or a pending application for a parenting order and the level of involvement in the child's life of each of those persons
- [321] This is addressed in considerations of ss. 37(2)(c) and (d) of the FLA .
-  the existence of an order, arbitral award, or agreement that specifies the geographic area in which the child is to reside

[322] The 2016 separation agreement provides that the children will reside with Ms. H. in [Mom's community]; however, for the reasons set out above, I have concluded that this arrangement is not in the children's best interest: see s. 37(3) of the FLA .

-  the reasonableness of the proposal of the person who intends to relocate the child to vary the exercise of parenting time, decision making responsibility or contact, taking into consideration, among other things, the location of the new place of residence and the travel expenses

[323] While Ms. H. sought an order for exclusive parenting responsibilities, Mr. B. did not. The basis for her application was, essentially, the parties' continuing conflict and level of acrimony; see: SMM v. JPH , 2011 BCSC 1084, at para. 227.

[324] Given that I have concluded that it is in the children's best interest that they reside in [Dad's community] with Mr. B., and given the conflict and differences to parenting evidenced over the years, I am satisfied that the children's best interests will be served by an order that Mr. B. exercise the parenting responsibilities exclusively, going forward.

[325] The actual locations of the parties' parenting time - [Mom's community] and [Dad's community] - are not changing: the place and travel expenses are the same. What is changing is the amount of time the children reside with each parent, with the attendant change in residence location.

 whether each person who has parenting time or decision making responsibility or a pending application for a parenting order has complied with their obligations under family law legislation, an order, arbitral award, or agreement, and the likelihood of future compliance

[326] As will be discussed further in Part 2 of this decision, relating to financial matters, Mr. B. has arbitrarily reduced his basic child-support payments such that his monthly payments reflect the Federal Child Support Guidelines amount, based on his current line 150 T1 General Tax Return. He has stopped paying spousal support. Both of those steps breach the October 2021 order of the Honourable Judge Gill.

[327] Further, in breach of the separation agreement, he no longer designates Ms. H. as his beneficiary in his life insurance policy.

[328] Ms. H. has breached the separation agreement by failing to consult with Mr. B. about important decisions that have had to be made regarding the children and she has not tried to reach agreement concerning those important decisions.

[329] Further, it is likely that she is breaching the January 7, 2022 order, given the evidence relating to Mr. W.'s involvement in her daily life and considering Ms. P.'s evidence about her desire to continue a relationship with him.

[330] Turning to other parts of the decision, the court in Barendregt captures the weight and gravity of what has turned out to be the main issue in this case: are the children's best interests best served by their remaining in [Mom's community], or relocating to [Dad's community]? At paragraph 8 the court states:

- [8] Determining the best interests of the child is a heavy responsibility, with profound impacts on children, families and society. In many cases, the answer is difficult - the court must choose between competing and often compelling visions of how to best advance the needs and interests of the child. The challenge is even greater in mobility cases. Geographic distance reduces flexibility, disrupts established patterns, and inevitably impacts the relationship between a parent and a child. The forwardlooking nature of relocation cases requires judges to craft a disposition at a fixed point in time that is both sensitive to that child's present circumstances and can withstand the test of time and adversity.

[331] As noted at paragraph 98 of the decision, difficulties inherent to the best-interest principles are amplified in the relocation context: 'Untangling family relationships may have profound consequences, especially when children are involved.'

[332] I have had regard to the court's observations at paragraph 132:

[132]  Concerns about parenting time with the child will inevitably be engaged in relocation cases: the crux of the dispute is whether it is in the child's best interests to move notwithstanding the impact on their relationship with the other parent. In other words, this concern is folded into the central inquiry before the court.

[333] I also note that in Barendregt , the court concludes that in relocation cases, family violence is a significant factor (see: para. 9). At paragraph 142, the court sates:

[142]  Since Gordon , courts have increasingly recognized that any family violence or abuse may affect a child's welfare and should be considered in relocation decisions: [a variety of cases cited]. Courts have been significantly more likely to allow relocation applications where there was a finding of abuse: Department of Justice, A Study of PostSeparation/Divorce Parental Relocation (2014), at ch. 3.3.4.

[143]  The suggestion that domestic abuse or family violence has no impact on the children and has nothing to do with the perpetrator's parenting ability is untenable. Research indicates that children who are exposed to family violence are at risk of emotional and behavioural problems throughout their lives: Department of Justice, Risk Factors for Children in Situations of Family Violence in the Context of Separation and Divorce (February 2014), at p. 12. Harm can result from direct or indirect exposure to domestic conflicts, for example, by observing the incident, experiencing its aftermath, or hearing about it: [articles and jurisprudential reviews cited].

[144]  . . . Thus, proof of even one incident may raise safety concerns for the victim or may overlap with and enhance the significance of other factors, such as the need for limited contact or support.

(My emphasis.)

[334] The reality articulated in the first underlined sentence of paragraph 143 quoted above reflects a concern woven throughout the evidence in this case, particularly given A.B.'s emotional and behavioural problems.

[335] There is no doubt that A.B. has, as well, experienced the aftermaths of the incident of violence, and, almost certainly, N. as well: Mr. W. moved out, for at least a time; A.B. has had to deal with feelings that he was responsible for Mr. W.'s departure and has, apparently, experienced a panoply of conflicting emotions that have taken him from seeing his dad's reporting the violence as 'appropriate' to something negative, in which Mr. B. conscripted his participation.

[336] Ms. H.'s failure to disclose the violence and her failure to disclose Mr. W.'s return to her family home in a most significant way is relevant to an assessment of her ability and willingness to care for the children. On this point, I take note of paragraphs 146 and 147 of Barendregt :

[146]  . . . the Divorce Act broadly defines family violence in s. 2(1) to include any violent or threatening conduct, ranging from physical abuse to psychological and financial abuse. Courts must consider family violence and its impact on the ability and willingness of any person who engaged in the family violence to care for and meet the needs of the child.

[147]  Because family violence may be a reason for the relocation and given the grave implications that any form of family violence poses for the positive development of children, this is an important factor in mobility cases.

## DECISION

[337] It is for the foregoing reasons that I made the order of November 1, 2023.
