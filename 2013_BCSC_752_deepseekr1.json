  "counsels_analysis": "ISSUE: Did the court properly apply FLA s. 65 reapportionment factors? RULE: Reapportionment requires unfairness finding per s. 65(1)(e)–(f). APPLICATION: Claimant proved 20-year career sacrifice and B.H.’s autism constraining economic independence. Respondent’s $4.7M post-separation home purchase demonstrated capacity. ANALYSIS GAP: Court ignored claimant’s $130K debt but offset by respondent’s tax liability allocation. CONCLUSION: 65% reapportionment legally sound. ISSUE: Was $1M income imputation justified? RULE: Guidelines s. 17 permits averaging volatile income. APPLICATION: Respondent’s $688K 2012 income outlier; $2.3M average overstated non-recurring gains. PREJUDICE: Imputation prevents manipulation via corporate structures (s. 18 Guidelines). CONCLUSION: $1M balances predictability/equity.",
