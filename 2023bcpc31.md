## INTRODUCTION

- [1] K.K. (the 'mother') and D.H. (the 'father') are the parents and guardians of A.H. ('A.H.') who is seven years old. After living together for approximately five years, they separated in August of 2020. Both parents are currently living in Nanaimo. A.H. spends alternating weeks with each of her parents.
- [2] On February 1, 2022 the mother served notice that she wishes to relocate with A.H. from Nanaimo to Port Alberni. The father then filed an application for an order prohibiting her from doing so. I heard the application over several days. The primary question is whether to allow the mother to relocate with A.H. to Port Alberni.

## ISSUES

- [3] Based upon the legislative framework which applies to the proposed relocation in this case, the issues are:
1. Is the mother's proposed relocation made in good faith?
2. Has the mother proposed reasonable and workable arrangements to preserve A.H.'s relationship with the father?
3. Is the mother's proposed relocation in A.H.'s best interests?
4. Whether the proposed relocation is permitted or prohibited, are any amendments to the current parenting arrangements required?

## LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK

- [4] In the context of this case, Division 6 of Part 4 of the Family Law Act S.B.C. 2011, c.25 (the ' FLA') governs the father's application to prohibit the mother's proposed relocation with A.H. to Port Alberni.
- [5] Section 66 of the FLA requires that a guardian proposing to relocate with a child provide all other guardians with prior notice. In this case the required notice was provided to the father, who is the only other guardian of A.H.

- [6] Section 67 of the FLA provides that, if notice is required and given, the guardians must use their best efforts to attempt to resolve the issues relating to the proposed relocation. In this case, the mother and the father made best efforts but were not able to resolve matters. As a result, a hearing has been required.
- [7] In accordance with s.68, the father filed an application for an order to prohibit the relocation within 30 days after receiving the notice.
- [8] The other relevant parts of Division 6 of Part 4 of the FLA include the following:
4. 69 (1) In this section, "relocating guardian" means a guardian who plans to relocate a child.
- (2) On application by a guardian, a court may make an order permitting or prohibiting the relocation of a child by the relocating guardian.
- (3) Despite section 37 (1) [ best interests of child ], the court, in making an order under this section, must consider, in addition to the factors set out in section 37 (2), the factors set out in subsection (4) (a) of this section.
- (4) If an application is made under this section and the relocating guardian and another guardian do not have substantially equal parenting time with the child,
8. (a) the relocating guardian must satisfy the court that

(i)the proposed relocation is made in good faith, and

- (ii)the relocating guardian has proposed reasonable and workable arrangements to preserve the relationship between the child and the child's other guardians, persons who are entitled to contact with the child, and other persons who have a significant role in the child's life, and
- (b) on the court being satisfied of the factors referred to in paragraph (a), the relocation must be considered to be in the best interests of the child unless another guardian satisfies the court otherwise.
- (5) If an application is made under this section and the relocating guardian and another guardian have substantially equal parenting time with the child, the relocating guardian must satisfy the court
- (a) of the factors described in subsection (4) (a), and
- (b) that the relocation is in the best interests of the child.

- (6) For the purposes of determining if the proposed relocation is made in good faith, the court must consider all relevant factors, including the following:
2. (a) the reasons for the proposed relocation;
3. (b) whether the proposed relocation is likely to enhance the general quality of life of the child and, if applicable, of the relocating guardian, including increasing emotional wellbeing or financial or educational opportunities;
4. (c) whether notice was given under section 66 [ notice of relocation ];
5. (d) any restrictions on relocation contained in a written agreement or an order.
- (7) In determining whether to make an order under this section, the court must not consider whether a guardian would still relocate if the child's relocation were not permitted.
7. 70 (1) If the court makes an order under section 69 [ orders respecting relocation ] that permits a child's relocation, the court may make any of the following orders:
8. (a) subject to subsection (2) of this section, if the order made under section 69 affects an agreement or order that allocates parenting arrangements between the relocating guardian and another guardian, an order under section 45 [ orders respecting parenting arrangements ] or 47 [ changing, suspending or terminating orders respecting parenting arrangements ], as applicable;
9. (b) any order necessary to ensure that the relocating guardian complies with the terms of the order permitting relocation, including an order to do one or more of the following:
10. (i) give security in any form the court directs;
11. (ii) transfer specific property to a trustee named by the court.
- (2) In making an order under subsection (1), the court must seek to preserve, to a reasonable extent, parenting arrangements under the original agreement or order.
- [9] When considering the best interests of a child, s. 37 of the FLA applies. It reads as follows:

- 37 (1) In making an agreement or order under this Part respecting guardianship, parenting arrangements or contact with a child, the parties and the court must consider the best interests of the child only.
- (2) To determine what is in the best interests of a child, all of the child's needs and circumstances must be considered, including the following:
- (a) the child's health and emotional well-being;
- (b) the child's views, unless it would be inappropriate to consider them;
- (c) the nature and strength of the relationships between the child and significant persons in the child's life;
- (d) the history of the child's care;
- (e) the child's need for stability, given the child's age and stage of development;
- (f) the ability of each person who is a guardian or seeks guardianship of the child, or who has or seeks parental responsibilities, parenting time or contact with the child, to exercise his or her responsibilities;
- (g) the impact of any family violence on the child's safety, security or well-being, whether the family violence is directed toward the child or another family member;
- (h) whether the actions of a person responsible for family violence indicate that the person may be impaired in his or her ability to care for the child and meet the child's needs;
- (i) the appropriateness of an arrangement that would require the child's guardians to cooperate on issues affecting the child, including whether requiring cooperation would increase any risks to the safety, security or well-being of the child or other family members;
- (j) any civil or criminal proceeding relevant to the child's safety, security or well-being.
- (3) An agreement or order is not in the best interests of a child unless it protects, to the greatest extent possible, the child's physical, psychological and emotional safety, security and well-being.
- (4) In making an order under this Part, a court may consider a person's conduct only if it substantially affects a factor set out in subsection (2), and only to the extent that it affects that factor.
- [10] In this case, the mother and the father do have substantially equal parenting time.

## FACTUAL CONTEXT

- [11] In determining whether to permit the mother to relocate with A. H. to Port Alberni, I must apply the law in the context of the relevant facts.
- [12] In the course of the hearing, I heard testimony from the mother, from her fiancée M.W., and from the father. I have also considered various documents provided in evidence as well as previous court orders made. This is not a case which turns on the reliability and/or credibility of the witnesses. Most of the facts are not in dispute.
- [13] The mother and the father lived together in a common-law relationship for about five years and then separated in early August of 2020.
- [14] They are the biological parents of A.H., who was born on [omitted for publication] and is now seven years old.
- [15] Before separation, the family resided in Nanaimo. While together, both parents played an active role in parenting A.H.
- [16] Following the separation, the mother left the family home in Nanaimo and moved with A.H. to Victoria. They lived first in a transition house and then in a rented apartment.
- [17] On August 5, 2020, the mother obtained a protection order against the father without notice.
- [18] On October 6, 2020 a consent order was made by Judge Sacca which provided that the father would have parenting time with A.H. three weekends out of four.
- [19] The father filed an application for an order that neither parent could change the residence of A.H. from Nanaimo. A hearing was held before Judge Barrett on November 20, 2020 and January 15, 2021.
- [20] On November 20, 2020, and by consent, Judge Barrett replaced the protection order with an order that the father shall not attend the mother's residence except with

her prior consent, that their communication be limited to that regarding A.H. and that it must be by text or email except in the case of an emergency.

- [21] On March 24, 2021, Judge Barrett gave written reasons on the father's application. She ordered that the interim order of Judge Sacca made on October 6, 2020 would remain in effect until June 30, 2021 and that, unless otherwise ordered or agreed, commencing July 1, 2021 neither parent was to change A.H.'s residence from Nanaimo before July 1, 2022.
- [22] The parties attended mediation and entered into a parenting agreement dated May 12, 2021 and a supplemental parenting agreement dated June 28, 2021.
- [23] In the agreement made on May 12, 2021 the parties agreed that the parenting schedule ordered by Judge Sacca would remain in effect until June 30, 2021, after which they would follow an equal 3443 schedule. They also agreed that until July 1, 2022 neither party would change A.H.'s place of residence from that of Nanaimo.
- [24] At the end of the 2020/2021 school year, the mother and A.H. moved from Victoria back to Nanaimo.
- [25] While living in Victoria, the mother completed her schooling to become a licenced practical nurse.
- [26] The father continues to rent and live in the residence in Nanaimo which he, the mother and A.H. resided in when together. He has been employed in the [omitted for publication] business for the past several years. Until quite recently, he worked for about six years at [omitted for publication] in Nanaimo. Since September of 2022, he has worked in the shop at [omitted for publication].

[27] Approximately two years ago, the mother began a relationship with M.W. They are presently engaged to be married. On [omitted for publication], they had a baby boy named R.W.

- [28] Presently the mother and M.W. are living together in Nanaimo in the second residence they have rented there.

- [29] The mother is on maternity leave until [omitted for publication] of 2023. She is confident that she will be able to obtain work as an LPN promptly following the end of her maternity leave.
- [30] Since July 2022, and by oral agreement, A.H. has spent alternating weeks in the care of her mother and father respectively.
- [31] The father works Monday to Friday each week. He also works every second Saturday. During the weeks when he has A.H. in his care, the father drops her off at before school care at about 7:30 am on his way to work and picks her up from after school care at about 5:30 pm on his way home.
- [32] M.W. grew up in Port Alberni and has extended family there, including his mother, step-father, step-siblings and the step-siblings' children.
- [33] M.W. is a red seal carpenter and has a successful carpentry business in Port Alberni. He largely attributes his business's success to working with a very good employee with whom he has done carpentry for many years and to receiving regular and ongoing quality work from an established Port Alberni contractor.
- [34] M.W. generally works Monday to Friday in Port Alberni. He has been commuting from Nanaimo each day. He usually leaves home by 5:30 am and does not return home until about 7 pm.
- [35] The only reason that the mother and M.W. continue to live in Nanaimo is because the father lives there.
- [36] Neither the mother nor the father have any family living in Nanaimo. The evidence indicates that the father's mother has a residence in the Ladysmith area and works in Alberta.
- [37] The father is estranged from his mother and does not want her to have any relationship with A.H. He has not seen his mother since Easter of 2021. At times, the mother facilitates visits between A.H. and the father's mother.

- [38] A.H. has a very close relationship with both of her parents and they are both very good parents to her.
- [39] A.H. has a good relationship with M.W. and his family and they are good to her.
- [40] M.W.'s mother and step-father would be happy to provide regular care for both A.H. and R.W. without charge.
- [41] M.W. understands and respects that he is not A.H.'s father and understands and respects the importance of A.H. having a close relationship with her biological father.
- [42] M.W. is willing to play an active role in driving A.H. to facilitate her parenting time with the father.
- [43] M.W.'s evidence is that it would not be reasonably feasible for him to successfully relocate his carpentry business from Port Alberni to Nanaimo. He says that his connections are in Port Alberni, his major source of ongoing work is a contractor in Port Alberni, and his employee, who is integral to the business's reputation, would not be willing to work in Nanaimo.

[44] The father testified that he is not willing to consider moving from Nanaimo to Port Alberni.

- [45] The mother and M.W. would like to purchase a house in the next two to three years. The evidence establishes that comparable housing is significantly less expensive to rent and to purchase in Port Alberni than in Nanaimo.
- [46] If permitted by the Court to relocate with A.H. from Nanaimo to Port Alberni, the mother proposes that A.H. would continue to spend alternating weeks with each parent until the relocation occurs. She proposes that, upon a relocation, A.H. would live primarily with her and M.W. in Port Alberni and would have parenting time with the father three weekends out of four and during one half of school holidays.
- [47] The father opposes the proposed relocation because he would no longer be parenting A.H. during the school week with all that that entails. The father would like

- A.H. to remain living in Nanaimo and to continue spending alternate weeks with each parent.
- [48] The evidence from both parents is that school authorities have recommended that A.H. enrol in the Rainbows program, which is for children whose parents are separated, but that the father has stood in the way of her doing so. The parents' evidence is also that A.H.'s school has recommended that she attend counselling provided by the school but that, again, the father has objected to her doing so. Some of the text messages included as evidence show that, at times, the father has become frustrated and angry and has resorted to using foul language.
- [49] The mother applied for and received a child care subsidy which lessened the amount that she and the father had to pay out of pocket for before and after school care for A.H. M.W. provided the father with the form or forms which had to be submitted for the father to apply for the child- care subsidy. Despite repeated requests, the father never applied for the subsidy. The explanation he gave in evidence for not applying is that he would not be comfortable receiving a subsidy because he equated it with welfare which he believes should not be paid to people who are working. Had he applied for and obtained a subsidy it would have been financially beneficial to him and to the mother.

## ANALYSIS

## Is the Mother's Proposed Relocation Made in Good Faith?

- [50] Section 69(6) (a) to (d) of the FLA sets out four non-exhaustive factors which the court must consider when assessing whether a relocating guardian is acting in good faith. I will consider each factor in turn.

## Factor (a): the reasons for the proposed relocation

- [51] The mother has provided five reasons why she would like to relocate with A.H. to Port Alberni. They are:  family support; proximity to M.W.'s carpentry business; better financial prospects; housing stability; and opportunities for A.H.

[52] Regarding family support, the mother notes that while neither she, the father nor M.W. have any family living in Nanaimo, M.W. has extended family living in Port Alberni. She points out that M.W.'s mother and step-father have become like grandparents to A.H. and would be happy to care for A.H. when needed. She also notes that M.W. has step-siblings and nieces and nephews in Port Alberni. The children are friends with A.H., are close to her age and may attend school with A.H. if she is in Port Alberni.

[53] The mother also says that A.H. is very close to R.W. and is proud to be his big sister. She says that allowing her to move with A.H. to Port Alberni would ensure that their relationship would remain strong and continue to develop.

[54] The father acknowledges that, if a relocation is allowed, A.H. would have more time with M.W.'s mother and extended family; however, he submits they do not qualify as family for A.H. He is concerned that he would not have parenting with A.H. during the school week.

[55] The next reason for the proposed relocation is proximity to M.W.'s carpentry business. M.W. testified that it would not be reasonably viable for M.W. to attempt to move his business from Port Alberni to Nanaimo. M.W. has worked with his employee for many years. Together they work quickly and do excellent work. The employee is vital to the business's strong reputation. He is not willing to move to Nanaimo or commute from Port Alberni to Nanaimo for work. Furthermore, the main source of work for the business is an established contractor who is based in Port Alberni and builds homes in the Port Alberni area.

[56] Presently, M.W. commutes from Nanaimo to Port Alberni five days each week. He must leave home by 5:30 am and does not return home until about 7 pm. If living in Port Alberni, on workdays M.W. would leave home about 7:30 am and return home by about 5:30 pm. Therefore, he would generally have approximately 3.5 hours of additional family time on workdays. In addition, if A.H. were to go to school in Port Alberni, M.W. would be able to assist in the case of illness or emergencies.

[57] The father accepts that there would be benefits to M.W. and to the mother if M.W. did not have to have to commute from Nanaimo to Port Alberni for his work. He is of the view that it should be viable for M.W. to relocate his business to Nanaimo. On all of the evidence, I disagree. I note that the father would never consider moving to Port Alberni and working there. Once again, his primary concern is that if A.H. is permitted to relocate to Port Alberni he would not be able parent her during school weeks.

- [58] The third reason that the mother has provided for wanting to relocate with A.H. to Port Alberni is financial.
- [59] The evidence is that when commuting to Port Alberni for work, M.W.'s gasoline costs are about $6,000 for each three-month period. Clearly, he would use far less gasoline if living in Port Alberni. The money saved would be available for the family to save or use to pay for other things.
- [60] The evidence indicates that generally the cost to rent a three-bedroom residence in Nanaimo is several hundred dollars per month more than it is to rent a comparable residence in Port Alberni.
- [61] The mother and M.W. would like to purchase a house in the next few years. The evidence is that one can purchase a house in Port Alberni for far less than in Nanaimo. The mother says that it is much more likely that she and M.W. would be able to own their own home in Port Alberni than in Nanaimo.
- [62] The mother notes that another financial benefit of A.H. going to school in Port Alberni would be a significant reduction in money spent on before and after school care. That is because, if in Port Alberni, M.W.'s mother and her husband would provide that care without pay.
- [63] The father acknowledges that relocating to Port Alberni would be financially beneficial to the mother and to M.W. However, he focussed on what it might mean for him financially. He noted that currently he works every second Saturday (making it a six-day work week for him). He says that if he was to have A.H. in his care three weekends out of four he would likely only work one Saturday in four or, alternatively,

would have to pay for child care one Saturday in four. Either way he says he would pocket less money. What he initially did not consider is that he would no longer have to pay his half of the current monthly day care costs. His share is now about $250 each month. The father also expressed concern that with the parenting schedule proposed by the mother in the event of a relocation, he may not be eligible to receive one half of the federal child tax benefits. I find it perplexing that he wishes to receive child tax benefits but has not applied for a child care subsidy.

- [64] The fourth reason that the mother gives for her proposed relocation is housing stability. The evidence is that the mother and M.W. were evicted from the first residence they rented together in Nanaimo because the landlord had other plans for the place. They found this to be stressful and unsettling. They were able to find another suitable place to rent; however, the rent is significantly higher. The mother is concerned that as long as they have to rent a place to live there will be potential instability. This is one reason she would like to be able to purchase a home. Based upon current house prices she believes that owning a house in Nanaimo would not be achievable for her and M.W.
- [65] The father agrees that it is less expensive to purchase a comparable home in Port Alberni than in Nanaimo but notes that, if she relocates to Port Alberni, A.H. would live first in rented accommodation before moving to a home that M.W. and the mother may purchase. He also submits that there is no guarantee that they will be able to purchase a home. The father notes that he is still living in the residence in which he, the mother and A.H. lived before separation. He says it is A.H.'s sanctuary, that he plans to continue to live there indefinitely and that he sees little likelihood he could be forced to move.
- [66] The final reason that the mother provided for wanting to relocate with A.H. from Nanaimo to Port Alberni is that it would provide for more opportunities for A.H. She points out that currently A.H. is not able to engage in sports and other organized activities after school because during weeks when she is in her father's care she is in afterschool care until he picks her up at about 5:30 pm. She notes that the father is concerned with establishing himself at [omitted for publication] and does not have any

flexibility in his work schedule. He is not available to take A.H. to any after school activities in which she may like engage. The father does not disagree.

- [67] I find that all five of the reasons that the mother has provided for wanting to relocate with A.H. to Port Alberni are sincere and legitimate. It seems that the father does not question the mother's sincerity but questions the legitimacy of some of her reasons.
- [68] The mother says that if A.H. was in her care during the school week she would continue to be involved with the school and could ensure that A.H. is able to benefit from any counselling and programs that are recommended.

## Factor (b):  whether the proposed relocation is likely to enhance A.H.'s and/or the mother's quality of life including increasing emotional well-being or financial or educational opportunities

- [69] The mother submits that if I allow her to relocate with A.H. to Port Alberni, it would enhance A.H.'s quality of life as well as her own.
- [70] Regarding A.H.'s quality of life, she says that a relocation would mean that A.H. would have the benefit of going to school with M.W.'s nieces and nephews and of being cared for before and after school by M.W.'s mother and step-father (rather than going to a day care program). She also says that if A.H. were living in Port Alberni during the school week she would be able to engage in sports and other organized activities after school. Further, the mother says that it would beneficial for A.H.'s schooling to have the continuity of being with the same parent every school week and, in particular, to be with her who is more involved in A.H.'s schooling.
- [71] The mother says that, if the relocation to Port Alberni is allowed, she and M.W would be better off financially. This would potentially benefit both her and A.H. She says further that her opportunity to own a house would be far greater in Port Alberni than in Nanaimo and that owning a home would provide the family with more security and stability.

- [72] The father says that a downside of A.H. going to school in Port Alberni would be that, during the school week, she would no longer see the friends she has at day care and at her current school. I note that if A.H. was to attend school in Port Alberni, there is no reason that she could not see Nanaimo friends on weekends.
- [73] I accept that a relocation to Port Alberni would result in a number of enhancements to the life of A.H. and to the mother.

## Factor (c): whether notice was given under section 66

- [74] The mother has certainly complied with the statutory requirement that she provide at least 60 days written notice to the father of her intention to relocate with A.H., of the location (Port Alberni) and of the date (July 1, 2022). The father agrees.
- [75] I am satisfied that, after the mother gave notice of her intention to relocate, she and the father have made their best efforts to cooperate and to attempt to resolve issues related to the proposed relocation. They have attended mediation and attempted through their respective lawyers to negotiate a resolution of all of the issues between them.

## Factor (d): any restrictions on relocation contained in a written agreement or court order

- [76] There is an interim order which restricts the parents from relocating with A.H. There is nothing restricting the court from making a final order allowing a relocation.

## Conclusion on Good Faith

- [77] The mother has provided some very legitimate and compelling reasons for wanting to relocate with A.H. While the father questions whether the reasons are legitimate he does not question that the mother is sincere in providing the reasons she has for wanting to relocate. The mother provided the father with the required notice of her wish to relocate with A.H. and, unlike in some cases, has not relocated the child before the issue of relocation has been decided by the court. I have no hesitation in

concluding that in proposing a relocation from Nanaimo to Port Alberni with A.H., the mother is acting in good faith.

## Has the Mother Proposed Reasonable and Workable Arrangements to Preserve A.H.'s Relationship with the Father?

- [78] The mother has proposed a detailed parenting schedule for A.H. in the event that she is permitted by the court to relocate with her. The parenting schedule which she proposes is clearly set out in a draft proposed order prepared and provided by her lawyer, Ms. Allan. The clauses set out in the proposed draft order relating to parenting time are as follows:
1. Until the mother relocates to Port Alberni, the parties will continue the one week on/one week off rotating parenting time schedule.
2. Upon the mother's relocation to Port Alberni, the parties will have parenting time as follows:
- a) the father will have parenting time with A.H. the first three weekends of every month from Friday afternoon at 5 pm to Sunday evening at 6:30 pm;
- b) if Friday or Monday are a statutory or other holiday, the father will have the additional overnight of parenting time such that his parenting time would start on Thursday at 5 pm or extend to Monday at 6:30 pm;
- c) the mother will have parenting time at all other times; and
- d) the father may have a video chat or phone call with A.H. each Tuesday and/or Thursday at 7 pm during the mother's parenting time.

3. The parties will meet at the [omitted for publication] in Parksville, BC or at another agreed upon location equally between their homes, to pick up and drop off A.H.
4. The parties are at liberty to modify the Regular Parenting Schedule on occasion to accommodate special circumstances and requests, and all variations will be by written agreement, which may include email or text messages.
5. The summer holiday period commences after school on the last day of school in June and ends on the morning when school resumes in September.
6. During the summer break, the parties will alternate parenting time with A.H. on a one week-on one week-off rotating basis, exchanging on Sunday at 6:30 pm.
7. During the summer break, each party may have a FaceTime or phone call with A.H. on Tuesday and/or Thursday at 7 pm during the other party's parenting time.
8. In odd-numbered years, the father will have the first week of winter break and the mother will have the second week, and in even-numbered years the mother will have the first week of winter break and the father will have the second week. They will transition on Boxing Day at noon.
9. On Mother's Day, the mother will have the option of parenting time with A.H. from 9 am to 6:30 pm.
10. On Father's Day, the father will have the option of parenting time with A.H. from 9 am to 6:30 pm.
11. On A.H.'s birthday, the parent who does not have parenting time will have the option of a minimum of 3 hours of parenting time, and will pick up and drop off A.H. from the other parent's home.

12. On R.W.'s birthday, if the mother does not have parenting time, she will have the option of parenting time with A.H. from 9 am to 6:30 pm.
13. The parent who does not have parenting time on Christmas Day or Easter Sunday may have a phone call or FaceTime with A.H. at noon.

[79] The mother and M.W. both testified that they recognize the importance of A.H. maintaining a close relationship with the father and that they are prepared to do a significant amount of the driving necessary to ensure that he has his parenting time with A.H.

[80] In the course of submissions, I asked the father to carefully review the proposed schedule set out above. I then asked him if he would propose a different parenting schedule in the event that I were to allow a relocation. He had difficulty answering this question. I then gave him time over the lunch break to consider this. In the end, he said he did not have a different schedule to propose in the event that I allowed the mother to relocate to Port Alberni with A.H.

[81] The father was clear in his submissions that he is conflicted in that, one the one hand, he would like to have A.H. in his care as much as possible but, on the other hand, he is concerned as to whether or not he could cope with working full-time and caring for A.H. three weekends out of four. He made it very clear that he is opposed to a relocation and would like the week on, week off schedule to continue indefinitely.

[82] In my view, the arrangements proposed by the mother to preserve A.H.'s relationship with the father are both reasonable and workable. While it would mean that A.H. would not be in her father's care during the school week, by having her three out of four weekends, he would have close to the same one on one time with A.H. as he does now. Significantly, he would have A.H. with him every second full week during the school summer break and for half of the other school holidays. Under the mother's proposed schedule, the father would see A.H. on his birthday, her birthday and on father's day.

## Is the Mother's Proposed Relocation in A.H.'s Best Interests?

- [83] In assessing whether the proposed relocation is in A.H.'s best interests, the court must consider each of the 10 non-exhaustive factors listed in s. 37(2) of the FLA .

## Factor (a): the child's health and emotional well-being

[84] The evidence from the mother and the father is that A.H. is healthy mentally and physically.

- [85] The mother notes that A.H. is a happy, friendly, well-rounded child and makes friends easily. She submits that A.H. would likely adapt well if she was to relocate to Port Alberni and attend school there. She says that A.H. is very happy and proud to be the big sister of R.W.
- [86] The mother also submits that it would be better for A.H. if she was to be in her care during all school weeks. She notes that she has more formal education than does the father and that, historically, she has been more involved with A.H.'s teachers and schooling than he has.
- [87] The mother says that A.H. would benefit emotionally from the time she would be able to spend with M.W.'s family and from the fact that she would no longer have to attend a day care for before and after school care.
- [88] Counsel for the mother referred the court to the decision of Hansen v. Ferguson 2015 BCSC 588. The judge had to decide whether to allow the mother to relocate with two young children from Victoria, British Columbia to Pembroke, Ontario. At para. 57, Madam Justice Fisher writes:

The health and emotional well-being of these children are inextricably tied to the health and emotional well-being of the mother. Her isolation, financial pressure and inability to advance her career in Victoria are not in the children's best interests even considering the contact they have with the father and his family.

[89] In the case before me, it is clear that the mother's emotional well-being is significantly enhanced by fact that she is in a very happy and financially secure relationship with M.W. It is also clear that the life she has with M.W. would be even better if she were able to relocate with A.H. to Port Alberni where M.W. has supportive family and a successful business. The mother intends to return to work as a licenced practical nurse at the end of her maternity leave. If the court permits her to relocate with A.H. to Port Alberni, she expects to work in Port Alberni mostly on weekends when A.H. would be in the care of the father in Nanaimo. That would increase the time that A.H. would be able to spend with the mother.

[90] As in the case of Hansen v. Ferguson , I find that A.H.'s emotional well-being is inextricably tied to that of the mother. It follows that A.H.'s emotional well-being would benefit from the mother continuing to have a strong relationship with M.W.

[91] The father submits that A.H. would be better off emotionally if she were to continue to live in Nanaimo and spend every second week with him. He is concerned that if he was only to have A.H. in his care on weekends that his close connection with her would be lessened. He also submits that A.H. is happy and doing well under the current arrangement so why change it. In my view, a relocation and a resulting change in the parenting schedule would not have a detrimental impact on A.H.'s health or emotional well-being.

[92] The evidence is that the father did not agree to A.H. taking counselling as recommended by her school. He also did not agree to her attending the wellrecognized Rainbows program for children who have separated parents. As a result, she has not had school counselling and has not attended the Rainbows program.

[93] The evidence is also that there was some delay in A.H. getting both dental care and eye care because of the father's reluctance to immediately contribute to the cost.

[94] I am of the view that A.H.'s health and emotional well-being may benefit from her being in the care of the mother during school weeks when medical and counselling appointments and programs are more likely to be scheduled.

- [95] Overall, I find that, on balance, allowing the mother to relocate with A.H. would be beneficial to A.H.'s health and emotional well-being.

## Factor (b): the child's views, unless it would be inappropriate to consider them

- [96] A.H. is only seven years old. She is too young for her views to carry any weight in the determination as to what is in her best interests.

## Factor(c): the nature and strength of the relationships between the child and significant persons in the child's life

- [97] The mother and the father are the two most significant people in A.H.'s life. She has a very close relationship with each of them. A.H.'s half-brother, R.W, is only about [omitted for publication] months old but will be a very significant person in her life.
- [98] It is clear that A.H. has a good relationship with M.W. and is developing good relationships with his family.
- [99] The evidence indicates that while A.H. has friends who attend her school and friends who attend her day care, they are not friends who she commonly spends time with outside of school or day care hours. On occasion, A.H. spends time with children of the father's friends.
- [100] If the mother is allowed to relocate with A.H. from Nanaimo to Port Alberni and A.H. attends school in Port Alberni she will no longer see her friends from her present school or day care during the week. However, if she wished to do so, she could spend time with those Nanaimo friends when with the father on weekends.
- [101] The most significant effect that a relocation to Port Alberni would have for A.H.in terms of her significant relationships is that she would not spend time with the father during the school week. Given he would have A.H. in his care most weekends and for one-half of all school holidays, I believe that a relocation would be unlikely to change the nature and strength of their relationship. As I stated earlier, both the mother and M.W. understand and respect the importance of A.H. maintaining the close relationship she has with the father.

[102] If A.H. was to relocate to Port Alberni, she would spend more time with her brother R.W. as well as with M.W. and his family.

[103] Counsel for the mother points out that, in almost every relocation case, a relocation will result in the child spending less time with the non-relocating parent. She says that if this was an overriding and determining factor in every decision in a relocation case, relocations would almost never be permitted by a court.

[104] Overall, I find that if I allow a relocation A.H. would continue to have a very strong relationship with the father and that her relationships with others would likely become enhanced overtime.

## Factor (d): the history of the child's care

[105] A.H. was just under five years old when her parents separated. When they were together, they were each actively involved in raising A.H. On the evidence, it seems however; that the mother had the primary role. Since separation, the parties have done a reasonably good job of co-parenting; however, the mother has had a greater role and has sometimes had difficulty obtaining the father's prompt cooperation in decisionmaking. Earlier, I set out the different parenting schedules which have been in place since the parents separated in August 2020. It is clear from the history that the mother is capable of parenting A.H. during school weeks. It is also clear from the history that at times when A.H. lived primarily with the mother that the mother has ensured that the father's scheduled parenting time has been consistently respected and followed.

[106] The history of care also demonstrates that the father is capable of caring for A.H. every other week.

[107] On balance I find the history of A.H.'s care is a neutral factor.

## Factor (e): the child's need for stability, given the child's age and stage of development

[108] A.H. is fortunate to be healthy and outgoing and to receive unconditional love from both of her parents. While all children benefit from stability in their lives, I believe,

on the evidence, that A.H. is likely more resilient and adaptable than many of her peers. The mother submits that there would be more stability for A.H. if she were permitted to relocate to Port Alberni. She says that the increased stability would come from A.H. being with the same parent (the mother) during every school week. She also says that, if and when, she and M.W. are able to purchase a home in Port Alberni the family would have more stability than if continuing to live in rental accommodation.

- [109] The father says that A.H. is doing well now and that her life would be disrupted if she relocated and attended school in Port Alberni.
- [110] I find that while it would take A.H. some time to adjust to a relocation, over a longer period it would provide her with more stability.

## Factor (f): the ability of each guardian to exercise his or her parental responsibilities

- [111] I am satisfied that generally both parents are capable of exercising their respective parental responsibilities and meeting A.H.'s important needs. It is apparent, however, that they have not always agreed on decisions which have had to be made. Some of the text messages presented as evidence show that the father has, at times, become frustrated and angry and resorted to foul language.

[112] I find it somewhat concerning that, despite being recommended, the father has not agreed to A.H. attending either counselling through the school or the Rainbows program. Given the evidence with respect to dental and eye care I am also somewhat concerned that, if left up to the father, in the future A.H. may not receive some health care as promptly as would be best for her.

## Factor (g): the impact of any family violence on the child's safety, security or wellbeing

- [113] There is no evidence before me to suggest that A.H. was ever exposed to any family violence when her parents were together or has been since they separated. Accordingly, this factor does not apply.

Factor (h): whether the actions of a person responsible for family violence indicate that the person may be impaired in his or her ability to care for the child and meet the child's needs

- [114] This factor is not applicable in this case.

Factor (i): the appropriateness of an arrangement that would require the child's guardians to cooperate on issues affecting the child, including whether cooperation would increase any risks to the safety, security or well-being of the child or other family members

- [115] As I have said, the mother and the father have not always been able to agree on parenting decisions and, at times, the father has become angry and used foul language. However, I am not too concerned about this factor. I will order arrangements which I believe will be best for A.H. and which will not pose any risk to A.H. or other family members.

## Factor (j): any civil or criminal proceeding relevant to the child's safety, security or well-being

- [116] There is no criminal proceeding and are no other civil proceedings. Accordingly, this factor does not apply.

## Whether the Proposed Relocation is in A.H.'s Best Interests

- [117] Upon carefully considering all of the factors listed in s. 37(2) of the FLA , I have concluded that, overall, allowing the mother to relocate with A.H. from Nanaimo to Port Alberni would be in A.H.'s best interests.

## Conclusion on Proposed Relocation

- [118] To summarize, I have found that the mother's proposed relocation from Nanaimo to Port Alberni is made in good faith, that the mother has proposed reasonable and workable arrangements to preserve the relationship between the father and A.H. and

that the relocation proposed is in the best interests of A.H. Accordingly, I order that the mother may relocate with A.H. to Port Alberni.

[119] The week-on/week-off schedule will continue until Friday, March 10, 2023 (the last day of school in Nanaimo before the Spring Break). A.H. shall continue to attend [omitted for publication] School until and including March 10, 2023. She is to begin attending school in Port Alberni following the 2023 School Spring Break.

## OTHER ORDERS

## Parenting Schedule

[120] I order that following the relocation, the parenting schedule for A.H. will be that proposed by the mother unless she and the father agree otherwise. Unless otherwise agreed, the parenting schedule will be that set out in paragraph [78] of this decision.

## Parental Responsibilities

[121] Now that I have allowed the proposed relocation, I will consider the matter of parental responsibilities. I am mindful of the fact that the parties have not always been able to agree and that this has prevented some things from happening. Accordingly, I have decided that if, after consulting each other about important decisions that must be made, the mother and the father are unable to reach agreement, the mother will be at liberty to make the decision and the father will be at liberty to seek a review before the court.

[122] In respect of parental responsibilities, I order as follows:

1. Pursuant to s. 40(2) of the Family Law Act , the mother and the father will share equally all parental responsibilities for the child as set out in s. 41 of the Family Law Act :
- a) making day-to-day decisions affecting the child and having day-today care, control and supervision of the child;

- b) making decisions about where the child will reside;
- c) making decisions about with whom the child will live and associate;
- d) making decisions respecting the child's education and participation in extracurricular activities, including the nature, extent and location;
- e) making decisions respecting the child's cultural, linguistic, religious and spiritual upbringing and heritage;
- f) subject to s. 17 of the Infants Act , giving, refusing or withdrawing consent to medical, dental and other health-related treatments for the child;
- g) applying for a passport, license, permit, benefit, privilege or other thing for the child;
- h) giving, refusing or withdrawing consent for the child, if consent is required;
- i) receiving and responding to any notice that a parent or guardian is entitled or required by law to receive;
- j) requesting and receiving from third parties, health, education or other information respecting the child, except in relation to health care provided pursuant to s. 17 of the Infants Act ;
- k) subject to any application applicable provincial or federal legislation,
- i. starting, defending, compromising, or settling any proceeding relating to the child, and
- ii. identifying, advancing and protecting the child's legal and financial interests, and

- l) exercising any other responsibilities reasonably necessary to nurture the child's development.
2. For the exercising of any parental responsibilities, both guardians must consult each other about any important decisions that must be made and try to reach agreement concerning those important decisions. If they cannot agree, the mother will be at liberty to make the decision and the father may seek a review before the court.
3. During their parenting time, a guardian may exercise the parental responsibility of making day-to-day decisions affecting the child, provided that the guardian must advise the other parent of any matters of a significant nature affecting the child.

## Communication

## [123] The mother and father will:

1. put the best interests of the child before their own interests;
2. encourage the child to have a good relationship with the other parent and speak to the child about the other parent and that parent's partner in a positive and respectful manner; and
3. make a real effort to maintain polite, respectful communications with each other, refraining from any negative or hostile criticism, communication, or argument in front of the child.

## [124] The mother and father will not:

1. question the child about the other parent or time spent with the other parent beyond simple conversational questions;
2. discuss with the child any inappropriate adult, court, or legal manners; or
3. blame, criticize, or disparage the other parent to the child.

2023 BCPC 31 (CanLII)

[125] Under s. 225 of the Family Law Act , the parties shall communicate with each other only by email and/or telephone. Communication is to be limited to that relating to the child, A.H.
