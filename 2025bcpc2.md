## INTRODUCTION

- [1] D.L.K. and N.A.N. (collectively 'the Parties') were married on [omitted for publication], 2010. During their relationship, they had two children, A.L.K. born [omitted for publication], and B.M.K. born [omitted for publication], (collectively 'the Children'). They separated on [omitted for publication], 2018.
- [2] On August 19, 2020, the Parties entered into a Separation Agreement ('the Agreement'). The Agreement dealt with many issues and was described as a final agreement. The portions of the Agreement that bear on the reasons for the Parties' appearance before the Court include:
- a)  Parenting, and in particular, the regular parenting schedule for the Children's time with each of the Parties; and
- b)  Child support, and in particular, what amount should be paid by one Party to the other depending on the parenting time regime.
- [3] The Agreement's regular parenting schedule is a two week rotating schedule including:
- a)  Week One -
7. -N.A.N. has parenting time from:
- I. 8 am Monday to 6 pm Wednesday,
- II. 8 am Thursday to 6 pm Thursday,
- III. 8 am Friday to 6 pm Thursday of Week Two;
11. -D.L.K. has parenting time from;
- IV. 6 pm Wednesday to 8 am Thursday,
- V. 6 pm Thursday to 8 am Friday,
- b)  Week Two -
15. -N.A.N. has parenting time from:
- I. 8 am Friday of Week One to 6 pm Thursday,
- II. 8 am Friday to 6 pm Friday,

- -D.L.K. has parenting time from:
- III. 6 pm Thursday to 8 am Friday,
- IV. 6 pm Friday to 8 am Monday of Week One.
- [4] The Agreement utilized an annual income for D.L.K. of $67,000 to calculate a child support payment for the Children of $980 per month commencing July 4, 2020.
- [5] It also contained clauses for the annual exchange of income information to permit determination of any changes to child support.
- [6] The Agreement was not filed in either the Provincial Court or the Supreme Court of British Columbia and as such is not yet enforceable as if it was an order of the Court.

## APPROACH TO THE PLEADINGS, EVIDENCE AND SUBMISSIONS

- [7] It is important for the Parties to have an understanding of my approach to reviewing and summarizing the pleadings, evidence and submissions. It is a similar approach to that adopted in R. v. Connell , 2017 BCPC 123, by the Honourable Judge T. Woods where he said at paragraphs 5 and 6:
- [5] … I will candidly acknowledge that in these Reasons for Judgment I have not made reference to all of the testimony given by the witnesses who were called, or to all of the documentary evidence that was received and marked. I have, rather, referred to evidence that I consider necessary to mention in connection with my factual findings and the legal conclusions that flow from them…. If witness testimony or documentary evidence do not come up for specific mention in these reasons that is because:
3. (a) The evidence was not relevant;
4. (b) The evidence is to the same effect as other evidence of which mention has been made; or
5. (c) The evidence was tendered in support of alleged facts I have not found and arguments that I have not accepted, having regard to the facts that I have found and the arguments that are supported by those facts.
- [6] That it is an acceptable practice for a trial judge to confine him or herself, in Reasons for Judgment, to a compressed and somewhat selective canvassing of the evidence heard at trial is well established on the authorities…[Citations omitted]

- [8] The pleadings, the evidence in support of them, and the submissions described in this decision are summarized and condensed. Where a topic is described in the pleadings, presented in evidence, and stated in submissions to support different findings it may be referred to only once.

## THE PLEADINGS

- [9] On April 9, 2024, D.L.K. filed an Application About a Family Law Matter (the Application) seeking orders in two areas:
- a)  To replace the regular parenting schedule in the Agreement with an equal parenting time regime on an alternating weekly basis; and
- b)  To vary the child support payment based on his proposed parenting time regime and undue hardship claim cancelling child support retroactive to August 19, 2020.
- [10] His reasons for seeking a change to the regular parenting schedule included:
- a)  When the Agreement was signed, the Children were younger and could not be left alone. They are older now and want to be on their own and he feels they want to be with him more;
- b)  The Children would benefit from equal parenting time. They are able to walk to and from school to both parent's homes and he would like them to learn some responsibility by allowing them to do so when it is his parenting time. He has backup plans if the weather is not reasonable;
- c)  A more balanced schedule would be beneficial for the family; and
- d)  A.L.K. has taken the Home Alone course; and she likes to take care of herself and her brother.
- [11] His reasons for varying the child support and claiming hardship include:
- a)  There has been a change in circumstances as N.A.N. has a fulltime job and is making more money. She also has another adult living with her contributing to the expenses and she receives rental income;
- b)  N.A.N. receives the Child tax benefit for the Children;
- c)  He recently built a home, as his previous accommodation was not suitable for the Children. He now has a mortgage and is struggling financially;

- d)  He cannot afford to be off work for a few days which causes him stress and he worries about interest rates going up when his mortgage is due for renewal; and
- e)  N.A.N. receives enough money to support the Children if there is an equal parenting regime. Payment of child support should be cancelled.
- [12] On May 2, 2024, N.A.N. filed a Reply to an Application About a Family Law Matter (the Reply) disputing the orders sought by D.L.K. She also seeks an order increasing child support based on D.L.K.'s increase in income since the Agreement.
- [13] Her reasons for opposing a change to the regular parenting schedule included:
- a)  It is not in the Children's best interest to be alone every day after school during D.L.K.'s parenting time because he does not get home from work until 6 pm. As such the Children would not be spending any more time with him;
- b)  The Children are comfortable with the present schedule and D.L.K.'s proposal would have them unsupervised for several hours every school day during his parenting time;
- c)  She has always picked the Children up after school so they don't have to walk home on busy roads, her mother lives right across the road from her and the Children can spend time with her as well until it is time for D.L.K. to pick them up;
- d)  She does not work during any of the of the school breaks including Spring, Summer, Christmas and statutory holidays;
- e)  Her work schedule permits her to take the Children to any appointments they require; and
- f) The present regular parenting schedule allows the Children to see each parent every week instead of only every alternate week.
- [14] Her reasons for opposing a reduction in child support, why D.L.K. claim of undue hardship should be rejected and that he should pay more child support included:
- a)  D.L.K. has been underpaying the amount of child support based on his income and the Child Support Guidelines ( CSG ) since 2018;
- b)  D.L.K. has been claiming B.M.K. as a dependent and has been receiving the Child tax benefit for B.M.K.;
- c)  D.L.K.'s claim of undue hardship arises from him building a home beyond his financial means; and

- d)  D.L.K. should be required to pay the appropriate amount of child support based on his income, which should be $1099.53 per month.

## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

- [15] On April 9, 2024, D.L.K. filed a Financial Statement indicating employment income of $70,032.60 as a carpenter employed by [omitted for publication].
- [16] It was not until his evidence at trial that the Court was made aware that [omitted for publication] is owned by D.L.K.'s parents and that he receives additional financial benefits both directly and indirectly.
- [17] His Financial Statement does not attach complete copies of previous years' tax returns but from what is attached it appears that D.L.K.'s gross declared income for the past few years was; a) 2021 - $66,033, b) 2022 - $67,036, and c) 2023 - $70,867.
- [18] D.L.K.'s tax information also shows he claims B.M.K. as a dependant despite B.M.K. living with him less than 40% of the time.
- [19] On May 2, 2024, N.A.N. filed a Financial Statement indicating employment income of $45,313.20 as an [omitted for publication] employed by [omitted for publication] (Prince George).
- [20] Her Financial Statement attaches complete tax returns and Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) Notices of Assessment indicating gross income for the past few years as: a) 2021 - $22,157, b) 2022 - $26,508, and c) 2023 - $32,950.
- [21] Her Financial Statement discloses that her partner, J.L. also resides in her home but that he contributes nothing to her household expenses. He is not listed on her recent tax returns as a spouse or common law partner.

## TRIAL EVIDENCE

- [22] The Parties' trial evidence reiterated and expanded upon what they set out in the Application and the Reply. In addition, each of them presented evidence that had either

nothing, or very little, to do with the issues defined in the pleadings. That evidence will not be reviewed and is not given weight in my deliberations.

## D.L.K.

[23] D.L.K.'s evidence on why the regular parenting schedule should change and how it would be implemented included:

- a)  N.A.N. claims to want to adhere to the Agreement and says she doesn't want the Children to be alone at his home. But, she or her mother often drop the Children at his home after school without notifying him and the Children are alone until he gets home;
- b)  N.A.N. is expecting another child in January 2025 and will have to devote time to that child. His plan for equal parenting time will be a benefit to the Children and to N.A.N.;
- c)  N.A.N.'s work schedule permits her to be at home with the Children from after school until he is able to pick them up when he gets off work. There have been times when he is able to leave work early that N.A.N. is unhappy that he is there before 6 pm to get the Children;
- d)  Equal parenting time would allow for planning for the Children and their activities as opposed to the ad hoc nature of how things are now;
- e)  His plan for the Children's supervision after school until he gets home if equal parenting time is implemented includes:
- I. His mother lives nearby and could pick the Children up from school and supervise them every Monday. It is in the Children's best interests to build a relationship with his mother like they have with N.A.N.'s mother,
- II. Other family members including his sister, a teacher, and his brother in law, a RCMP member, are prepared to assist in supervising the Children on other days;
- f) The people assisting in supervising the Children could take the Children to activities and appointments during his parenting time;
- g)  Those same people would be able to supervise the Children on all holiday and vacation times if he was working. In addition, his family have a lakeside cabin where the Children could spend time with his extended family;

## N.A.N.

[26] N.A.N.'s evidence on why the regular parenting schedule should not change included:

- h)  In the past he has only once taken time from work to care for the Children when they were ill; and
- i) His job sometimes requires him to work late even when he has the Children under the present regular parenting schedule.
- [24] D.L.K.'s evidence about his undue hardship included:
- a)  He is a carpenter and works for a company owned by family members. He makes $36 per hour for a 35 to 50 hour work week but with no overtime hourly rate;
- b)  In addition to his paid income he has the use of an insured company truck, the company pays for his phone bill and contributes to his fuel expenses;
- c)  He built a home in 2022 because the mobile home he was living in was rodent infested and not suitable for the Children. That home has increased his monthly expenses including a mortgage and other related expenditures;
- d)  The construction of his home has not been the cause of him struggling financially;
- e)  He is not sure if he claims B.M.K. as a dependent on his tax returns;
- f) J.L. is a contractor and is contributing to N.A.N.'s household expenditures; and
- g)  His partner does not reside with him or share the expenses but they do travel together.
- [25] D.L.K.'s evidence about child support included:
- a)  If an equal regular parenting schedule is implemented there should be no child support payable by either party because they would be meeting the Children's needs when they are with one party or the other; and
- b)  He gives his child support cheques to the Children to give to N.A.N. so the Children know he is contributing.

- a)  Under the Agreement's regular parenting schedule she has the Children about 75% of the time and D.L.K. has them about 25%;
- b)  They separated in 2018 due to D.L.K.'s drinking and drug taking, which has continued. He lost his driver's licence for a period of time due to alcohol related charges;
- c)  She was a stay at home parent until the Children were in school;
- d)  Once the Children were in school she obtained work that permitted her to be home with the Children when they got out of school thereby saving her and D.L.K. day care costs;
- e)  The present schedule is great for the Children because they have a regular routine and supervision. She takes them to all of their appointments and activities. D.L.K. is informed of those matters but never attends;
- f) When the Children are ill she is the one who takes time off work or gets the assistance of her mother. D.L.K. does nothing;
- g)  The Children report eating late and staying up late at D.L.K.'s home and they sometimes claim to be ill the day after they are with him;
- h)  Her work schedule with the school district gives her time off for all the school breaks the Children have including Christmas. Spring and Summer; and
- i) She had a good co-parenting regime with D.L.K. until he became involved with his present partner.
- [27] N.A.N.'s evidence about D.L.K.'s undue hardship claim included:
- a)  His claim is based on his increased monthly expenses directly attributable to him building a home he cannot afford;
- b)  He makes about the same hourly income he made six years ago. He is a red seal carpenter and could be making as much as $42 per hour;
- c)  He does not declare all his income and he gets a number of benefits and bonuses that are not reflected in his income. That is the way things were done when they were married;
- d)  She and J.L. keep their finances separate. She is unaware of his income. He does not contribute to her monthly housing expenses, except for some utilities, but does contribute to groceries; and
- e)  She did not declare J.L. as her common law spouse up to 2023 but will on her 2024 tax return.

- [28] N.A.N.'s evidence about child support included:
- a)  The Parties met with a Family Justice Counsellor who told them D.L.K. should be paying more child support because his income had increased;
- b)  D.L.K. has not increased his child support payments since the Agreement was signed and she would like the increase to start on January 4, 2025.

- (a) the amounts set out in the applicable tables for each of the spouses;
- (b) the increased costs of shared parenting time arrangements; and

## b) Undue hardship

- 10 (1) On either spouse's application, a court may award an amount of child support that is different from the amount determined under any of sections 3 to 5, 8 or 9 if the court finds that the spouse making the request, or a child in respect of whom the request is made, would otherwise suffer undue hardship.

## Circumstances that may cause undue hardship

## Standards of living must be considered

## DISCUSSION

## Regular Parenting Schedule

- [33] The regular parenting schedule set out in the Agreement has, at least in recent months, not been firmly adhered to. N.A.N. says that the Children ask to go to D.L.K.'s home in advance of the regular start time because, they say, he will be home early when that is not the case.
2. (d) it appears that income has been diverted which would affect the level of child support to be determined under these Guidelines;
3. (f) the spouse has failed to provide income information when under a legal obligation to do so;
4. (g) the spouse unreasonably deducts expenses from income

- [34] D.L.K. says the Children are dropped at his home by N.A.N. or her mother without any advance notice to him in circumstances where he cannot leave work early.
- [35] N.A.N. does not like D.L.K. arriving to pick up the Children earlier than the scheduled time. D.L.K. responds that on the occasions when he can leave work early he should be able to start his parenting time with the Children.
- [36] Those concerns can be addressed by imposing a more defined regular parenting schedule order.
- [37] D.L.K.'s claim to implement an equal regular parenting time regime is based on the following:
- a)  A varying list of adult supervisors who will come from different locations to either supervise the Children at his home or elsewhere;
- b)  His wish for the Children to have more independence and responsibilities now that they are older than they were when the Agreement was signed;
- c)  The opportunity for the Children to see his extended family more even if he is unavailable due to work;
- d)  N.A.N.'s ability to devote the same resources to the Children when she has a new child arriving soon;
- e)  His proposed schedule is a simpler routine for the Children with fewer transfers back and forth on varying days; and
- f) The present schedule only allows him a maximum of two consecutive days of parenting time.
- [38] N.A.N.'s opposition to any changes to the regular parenting schedule is based on the following:
- a)  The present schedule as described in the Agreement is working well for the Children because they are used to the routine;
- b)  D.L.K. is too lenient with the Children's schedules resulting in difficulties in their proper school attendance after spending parenting time with him; and
- c)  His plan for the after school supervision for the Children is scattered among too many people and their varying availability.

- [39] I find that D.L.K.'s proposal to move to an equal regular parenting regime is not in the Children's best interests for the following reasons:
- a)  The after school supervision plan relies on too many moving pieces with different supervisors on different days depending on varying schedules;
- b)  It will not result in him having much additional parenting time directly with the Children;
- c)  It is clearly based, at least in part, on D.L.K. desire to eliminate the child support payments based on his incorrect understanding of what a shared parenting schedule between parents with disparate incomes would look like.
- [40] However, N.A.N.'s assertion that the schedule remain as described in the Agreement is also not in the Children's best interests and does not take into account that the Children are maturing and they have far more time with her extended family than they are able to have with D.L.K.'s extended family.
- [41] D.L.K.'s proposal for the Children to be supervised by his mother, who has Mondays free to spend time with them, has merit. Additional time under his care will allow for more contiguous days of parenting time and will permit a testing of his family's commitment to assist in the supervision of the Children. In addition, it will require fewer transfers of the Children between the Parties.
- [42] D.L.K. will also have the opportunity to demonstrate that he can make arrangements with his employer to work longer hours when the Children are not with him so he would be able to leave work earlier on some days when he has his parenting time.
- [43] Commencing with the first Week One following the release of these Reasons the regular parenting schedule will be:
- a)  Week One -
10. -N.A.N. will have parenting time from;
- I. 8 am Tuesday to 6 pm Thursday,
- II. 8 am Friday to 6 pm Thursday of Week Two;

- -D.L.K. will have parenting time from;
- III. 6 pm Thursday to 8 am Friday,
- b)  Week Two -
- -N.A.N. will have parenting time from;
- I. 8 am Friday of Week One to 6 pm Thursday,
- -D.L.K. will have parenting time from;
- II. 6 pm Thursday to 8 am Tuesday of Week One.
- [44] The Children are not taken to, or left at, D.L.K.'s home earlier than the start time of his regular parenting unless he has confirmed in advance, with N.A.N. that he agrees to that arrangement and there is someone available to supervise the Children.
- [45] D.L.K. shall not arrive at N.A.N.'s home earlier than the start of his regular parenting time without providing her with at least one hour's advance notice of his arrival time.

## Undue Hardship

- [46] Under the first step of the undue hardship analysis described in Section 10 of the CSG the onus is on D.L.K. to provide evidence that his financial circumstances meet the criteria before there is any requirement for N.A.N. to fully disclose her household's financial situation in the second stage of the analysis ( Chong and D.L.D. ).
- [47] The only evidence D.L.K. presented on the issue is that he has higher shelter expenses than he had before he built his home and that he is concerned interest rates may rise further increasing those expenses.
- [48] He did not properly or fully disclose his income and benefits arising from his employment and that information may have never been brought to the Court's attention but for N.A.N. raising the issue.
- [49] The examples of undue hardship found in the case law include descriptors like 'exceptional, excessive or disproportionate' ( Van Gool ), and 'severe or extreme' ( Kelly ). D.L.K.'s evidence did not meet the test as described in those cases. He has not

satisfied me that his present financial circumstances meet the requirements of the first step of the analysis in Section 10 of the CSG.

## Child Support

[50] Child support is the right of the Children, not something the Parties may consider a bargaining chip in conjunction with other issues. The Children are entitled to the full benefit of the financial resource of both parents.

[51] When the Agreement was signed, there was a clause requiring the exchange of income information so that the proper amount of child support could be assessed annually. There was no evidence presented confirming such information was exchanged.

[52] In light of D.L.K.'s increase in income since 2020 and the additional employment benefits he receives, he should have been paying a minimum of $1,100 per month in child support since 2023 (based on his income in that year) and perhaps even more in 2024 and into 2025. That would amount to at least $2,880 in arrears for 2023 and 2024.

[53] N.A.N. wishes the increase to start on January 4, 2025, and I will make such an order but it will be in the amount of $1,100 per month.

[54] That order will be without prejudice to her right to seek retroactive support once the correct information of D.L.K.'s financial circumstances have been disclosed. There will be a requirement that D.L.K. disclose his income and benefits information on an annual basis and if he fails to do so he may face a financial penalty as provided for in Section 213 of the FLA .

[55] D.L.K. was under the erroneous impression that if the Court had granted him equal parenting time his child support obligations to N.A.N. would cease because they would share the Children. He would benefit from informing himself about Section 9 of the CSG that provides guidance on how child support is calculated in a shared parenting time regime.

- [56] At present, D.L.K. pays the child support by giving it to one of the Children to deliver to N.A.N. His reasoning that it is done in order for the Children to know he is contributing is specious and it must stop. D.L.K. will be required to make the child support payments directly to N.A.N. either by monthly e-transfers or post-dated cheques for all months for each calendar year.

## DECISION

- [57] This is an interim order.
- [58] Upon the Court being advised that the name and birth date of each child is as follows:
- a)  A.L.K. born [omitted for publication] ('A.L.K.'); and
- b)  B.M.K. born [omitted for publication] ('B.M.K.')
- [59] Pursuant to Section 214 of the Family Law Act all provisions of the Separation Agreement dated August 19, 2020, between D.L.K. and N.A.N. attached to this Order remain in full force and effect unless varied or superseded by this Order.

## Regular Parenting Schedule

- [60] Commencing with the first Week One following the release of these Reasons the regular parenting schedule will be:

- [62] D.L.K. shall not arrive at N.A.N.'s home earlier than the start time of his regular parenting without providing her with at least one hour's advance notice of his arrival time.

## Child Support

- [64] D.L.K. is found to be a resident of British Columbia and is imputed to have a guideline annual income of $70,867.
- [65] D.L.K. shall pay to N.A.N. the sum of $1,100 per month for the support of the Children commencing on January 4, 2025, continuing on the fourth day of each and every month thereafter for so long as the Children are eligible for support under the Family Law Act or until further court order.
- [66] The order for child support is without prejudice to any claims N.A.N. may have a retroactive child support dating back to January 1, 2023.
- [67] For as long as the Children are eligible to receive child support D.L.K. shall provide to N.A.N.:
- a)  Copies of his income tax return for the previous year including all attachments not later than May 31 each year ;
- b)  Written confirmation from his employer of all additional benefits he receives in cash, in kind or by way of any subsidy not later than May 31 each year; and
- c)  Copies of any Notice of Assessment or Reassessment provided by the Canada Revenue Agency immediately upon receipt.

[68] Commencing immediately D.L.K. shall make the child support payments directly to N.A.N. by either monthly e-transfers or post-dated cheques for all months for each calendar year.
