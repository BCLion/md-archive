4. (c) the amount  of support to be paid by the respondent,  and whether retroactive support should  be ordered.

## II SUMMARY OF REASONS FOR JUDGMENT

- [2] For the reasons that follow I have concluded:
2. (a)  although  the existing schedule should  be altered, equal parenting time is not currently  in the children's best interests;
3. (b)  there should  be a reapportionment  of the family assets with the net result being a compensation payment to the claimant in the amount  of $645,000;
4. (c)  the respondent's contingent  tax liability is to be apportioned 75% to him and 25% to the claimant;
5. (d)  the respondent's income for support purposes commencing January  1, 2013, is imputed at $1 million per annum;
6. (e)  the claims for retroactive child and spousal support are dismissed.

## III BACKGROUND

- [3] I  was assisted by comprehensive  written  submissions submitted on behalf of both parties. Much of the chronology  that  follows is an edited version of a portion of the claimant's written  argument  setting out the relevant  background  pertaining to the parties and their relationship.

- [4] The relationship between the parties is one of 20 years with seven years of marriage. Ms. H.'s evidence is that the parties began to cohabit in October 1990. Mr. H. says this occurred in March or April 1991. They  were married on August 23, 2003 and separated on November 19, 2010.
- [5] Mr. H. was born July  5, 1969, and is 43 years old. Ms. H. was born May 25, 1971, and is 41 years old.
- [6] The children  of the marriage are B.H. ('B.') born February  25, 2005, age 8, and L.H. ('L.') born January  2, 2007, age 6.

## Chronology

1990 - 1996

- [7] The parties met at Plymouth  University  when  Ms. H. was 19 years old and Mr. H. was 21 years old.
- [8] Ms. H. obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in 1994 from Plymouth University.  Mr. H. graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Geology.  Both then  attended the University  of London, where Ms. H. received a Master's degree in Latin American Economic and Social History and Mr. H. received a Master's degree of Science in Mineral Exploration.
- [9] Following their graduation from the University  of London,  the parties lived with Ms. H.'s parents and worked at odd jobs while Mr. H. applied for work as a geologist. In  1996, he was hired on a short-term  contract  with I. Mining, which  required him to relocate to Panama. Ms. H. remained in the United Kingdom.

1997 - 2002

- [10] Mr. H.'s temporary position was extended and in 1997 he was relocated to Peru. In  the spring of 1997, Ms. H. joined him in Peru. She left a position as an executive  assistant to do so.

- [11] From 1997 to 2002 the parties lived in Peru. Ms. H. worked for approximately 18 months  as an executive  assistant to a senior economist for an international agency and then  as a Spanish/English  translator  for a public relations company.

## 2002 - 2004

- [12] In  2002, Mr. H. was relocated back to the U.K., and the H.s returned  and lived there until  2004. Mr. H. worked in Europe and Australia for I.  Mining on various projects. Ms. H. continued  to do some work for her Peruvian  employer. The parties were married in the U.K. on August  23, 2003. Ms. H. became pregnant  with B. in 2004.

## 2004 - 2008

- [13] In  2004, Mr. H. was encouraged by a colleague to apply for a position with a mining company based in British Columbia called L. Copper, which  was operated by a successful  mining entrepreneur,  R.B. Mr. H. testified that he was ready to leave his stable, salaried position with I. Mining to work in the 'high risk - high return'  world of the junior mining industry  and have his remuneration  be linked to the success of this company.
- [14] Junior mining companies, as described by Mr. H., are generally  at the exploration  stage with properties that have not reached production.  Typically,  these companies are not seeking to be a mining producer. Instead,  they  sell their projects to major mine operators, who have the funding  and experience needed to build and operate a mine.
- [15] Mr. H. joined L. Copper, a junior mining company with approximately  10 copper exploration  projects in South America, and moved to Vancouver  in 2004.
- [16] Ms. H. initially remained in the U.K., packed up the couple's belongings and moved to Vancouver later to join Mr. H. The house they  had purchased in the U.K. was rented for about a year and was then  sold.

- [17] Ms. H. became pregnant with B. shortly  after coming to Vancouver  in 2004 and gave birth to him in February 2005. After B. was born, she did not work outside the home. The parties adopted traditional family  roles. Mr. H. pursued his career and was the income earner for the family,  while Ms. H. devoted herself to the family and the children.
- [18] Mr. H. managed the exploration  part of L. Copper's business by managing budgets, supervising drill programs and dealing with press releases. His work was demanding and required extensive  travel.  He was often gone to remote locations such as Chile, Peru, Argentina and Northern  Canada. He was away from Vancouver for one to three weeks per month.  He was often called away on short notice. His return  dates were frequently  extended.
- [19] Ms. H. testified that Mr. H. was not always able to leave his work at the office. He would work into the evenings  and sometimes on weekends. There would  be periods of urgency  when  a deal was taking place or when  drill results  were being announced.  The burden fell on Ms. H. to care for the children and to organize their lives.
- [20] B.'s birth in 2005 was difficult and he suffered  immediately from a number  of health  issues. His first few years were extremely  challenging  for both parents,  but particularly  for Ms. H., due to B.'s sleep issues. Both parties described Ms. H. as suffering  from severe sleep deprivation.
- [21] The difficulties were compounded when  L. was born on January  2, 2007. Ms. H. had two children  at home, one of whom  was extremely  challenging,  and a husband who had a busy and demanding career. The H.s were able to afford the services of a nanny  to assist Ms. H. They  initially  used L.M., who was later replaced by G.A. ('Ms. A') the primary nanny  for the family from 2008 until the separation. K.S. ('Ms. S.') from Nannies-on-Call  worked intermittently  for the family in 2010 when Ms. A. was away.  Ms. S. continued to babysit for Ms. H. on occasion after the separation.

- [22] As B. grew older, Ms. H. began to notice that he was not meeting his developmental  milestones. This led her to have B. assessed at Sunnyhill  Hospital, which resulted  in a diagnosis of autism in September 2008. Mr. H. was travelling  and not present for the meeting in which the diagnosis was given to Ms. H.
- [23] Extensive  evidence was given by the H.s' caregivers and therapists about B.'s autism-related  challenges,  including  difficulty  with social skills, communication, comprehension,  outbursts  and obsessive and repetitious behaviours.  He was also described generally  as a bright and loving child with a great deal of energy.  For example, while his sleep patterns have improved, he wakes up at 6:00 a.m. and when he does, he is wide awake, full  of energy and requires immediate attention. There was universal  agreement that B. is a child who requires consistency, predictability and routine. He can tolerate change only  if he is given significant advance notice of it. Parenting B. is a great deal of work.
- [24] B. has been assisted by a team of professionals, including E.A. (a behavioural  consultant),  J.W. (an occupational  therapist), J.E.l. (a speech pathologist) and E.T. (a music therapist).  The therapists who testified at trial confirmed that B. has made progress in a variety  of ways including  increased attention  span, eye contact, gross and fine motor skills as well as improvements  in dealing with sensory challenges  and in social skills.
- [25] Ms. T. indicated that  B. reacts poorly to changes in routine or consistency. She emphasized that autistic children  will react and regress if they do not feel secure in their environment.  The  overall goal is to keep them calm and regulated.  They  are not able to learn and retain information  if stressed. B. needs extra consistency.  He can tolerate some change but only  with a great deal of advanced warning so that he can prepare himself and feel secure.
- [26] Ms. E. indicated that B. had his own internal  world.  He exhibited stereotypical behaviour  of autistic children,  including delayed language skills,  scatter skills, obsessions with things  such as train schedules or elevators.  B. struggles  with language and reading comprehension.  She noted that B. could decode words but

had trouble  understanding  what  he was reading and his level of comprehension  was uncertain.  His STIMS  (repetitive behaviours)  included  whistling and flapping. These were behaviours  that had to be managed and were not always  under his control. She worked with him on responding appropriately to questioning,  understanding stories, self-monitoring  and appropriate social behaviour.

[27] Ms. A. indicated that B. struggles with his emotions, STIMS,  change and social skills. He reacts poorly to unstructured  time, inconsistent  consequences  and overstimulation.

## 2008 - 2011

- [28] When Mr. H. started with L. Copper in 2004, he was earning less than $120,000 per year. He later renegotiated his salary to a lower amount  in return  for receiving options in the company.  The acquisition of options in exchange  for a reduced salary began to pay off after 2006. He earned $733,972 in 2006, $429,507 in 2007 and $3.4 million in 2008.
- [29] In  2008, a significant change occurred in Mr. H.'s career. By 2008, L. Copper had sold nine of its 10 projects and there was insufficient  ongoing work. In  2009, Mr. H. and a group of colleagues began implementing a business arrangement  by which they  could work together profitably.  The result  was L. Capital Limited Partnership ('L. Capital'). L. Capital was described by Mr. H. as an investment  fund focused on junior mining ventures.
- [30] L. Capital began with a $3 million initial investment,  of which  Mr. H. contributed  $300,000. He is a partner in L. Capital. His role is project management and evaluation  of properties.
- [31] Mr. H.'s interest in L. Capital is held through  a corporate structure.  He is trustee of the H. Family Trust,  which  in turn  owns 100% of A. Investments  Ltd. A. Investments  Ltd. in turn  owns 119,964 units in L. Capital and a 20% share interest in L. Asset Management  Limited, the management  company  for L. Capital. A. Investments  also owns 100% of H. Consulting  Ltd., Mr. H.'s operating company.

- [32] The family's lifestyle  improved steadily during their years in Vancouver.  In 2004, the H.s bought a home on West 15th Avenue,  which they  sold in 2006 for $948,000. The net sale proceeds were used to purchase what became their family home on West 5th Avenue (the 'West 5th Avenue  property'),  purchased in 2006 for $1.5 million. In  2007, the H.s bought  a recreational property in Whistler  (the 'Whistler property')  for approximately  $1.13 million. Both the West 5th Avenue property and the Whistler property were substantially  renovated between 2007 and 2011 at a cost in excess of $1 million.
- [33] The family was able to afford multiple  vehicles, expensive  travel  and shopping at high-end  stores.
- [34] As B. and L. grew older, they  began to attend preschool and elementary school. In  2008, B. started at U.l.  Preschool followed by B. Preschool in 2009. He also attended a special needs GABA Preschool in 2009. In  2009, L. began to attend U.l. Preschool at age two and a half and then,  in January  2010, started at B. Preschool.

## Separation

- [35] In  mid-July  2010, Mr. H. decided he wanted a separation. The parties continued  to share the family home and attempted to work on their marriage. In November 2010, they planned a trip to New York.  Ms. H. flew to New York.  Mr. H. was to join her, but later called and cancelled. Ms. H. indicated this was when  she realized the marriage was over.
- [36] On November 19, 2010, Ms. H. returned  from New York and asked Mr. H. to move out of the West 5th Avenue  property.  He did so. This was the date of separation.
- [37] Mr. H. returned  to the West 5th Avenue  property on occasion between November 2010 and March 2011 but there was no reconciliation.  There was some limited attendance at couples' counseling,  but that  ended with a physical incident in

April 2011 which appears to have irreparably damaged the parties' personal relationship.

## 2011 to 2012

[38] In  early 2011, Mr. H. paid off the mortgage debt against the West 5th Avenue property,  where Ms. H. and the children  were living. This was in the amount  of $1.62 million.

- [39] In  May 2011, Mr. H. purchased his own home on West 3rd Avenue  for $4.7 million with mortgage financing  of $3.5 million.  Mr. H. stated that the down payment was $700,000. His total out of pocket cost (net of mortgage financing) was $1,194,161.87 (that is a deposit of $230,000 with a balance of $964,161.87 being paid). The  mortgage payments are $14,000 a month.
- [40] In  2011, Mr. H. also leased a Toyota 4 Runner  for $57,000 and an Aston Martin, in addition to the two vehicles he owned  during the marriage. Ms. A. uses his Range Rover. His girlfriend, S., uses the Toyota 4 Runner.  He spent about $150,000 on furnishings  for his home.
- [41] From November 2010 to June or July  2011, Mr. H. contributed  funds to the parties' joint account to pay for renovations  to the West 5th Avenue  property and other purposes, including making funds  available for Ms. H. Credit card balances were paid from this account.  Mr. H.'s evidence is that he transferred  in excess of $1 million to the joint account  between November 2010 and June  2011.
- [42] In  July  2011, Mr. H. began voluntarily  paying Ms. H. non-taxable  support of $18,000 per month.  He self-allocated  the amount as $10,000 spousal support and $8,000 child support. The $18,000 was based on an income of $660,000 as stated in his July  18, 2011 Financial Statement.  Ms. H. accepted the $18,000, pending further disclosure and analysis of Mr. H.'s income, and payment  of that amount  continued until  the time of trial.

- [43] Mr. H. also contributed to the Whistler property's mortgage account  until July 2011. There was also rental  income from the Whistler property  that was used to defray some of the ongoing expenses.

## Legal Proceedings

- [44] These proceedings were commenced on May 13, 2011. On September 12, 2011, a declaration was made under  section 57 of the Family Relations Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 128, that there was no possibility of reconciliation. This is the triggering event for the purposes of the division of assets under  the Family Relations Act .

## Parenting Schedule

- [45] The schedule  was ad hoc during the first year and a half after the separation. The children  were with Mr. H. two weekends a month  from Friday at 5:00 p.m. to Sunday at 5:00 p.m. and two mid-week overnight  visits three weeks of the month.
- [46] This was the schedule  until  a mediation took place in April 2012 that resulted in an agreed schedule  set out in Minutes  of Settlement  dated April 13, 2012, being:
- [47] The parties also reached agreement on summer holiday time and the children's attendance  at summer camps.
- [48] In  terms of the use of nannies and babysitters after the separation, Ms. H.'s evidence was that  she used Ms. A. extensively  after July  2010. This was when Mr. H. announced  he wanted a separation. It was a very emotional time. She testified her use of Ms. A. decreased over the next year and in 2012, she very rarely

used a third party caregiver. In  addition to Ms. A., she occasionally  used Ms. B. from Nannies-on-Call  as a spare and Ms. S. She characterized  their role as babysitters. Mr. H. has also used Ms. A. as a caregiver extensively  since the separation, as well as Ms. B., Ms. M. and nannies  from Nannies-on-Call.

- [49] The parties swore financial statements  in mid-2011 (although  Mr. H. did not complete his Part 2 - Expenses at that time) and again in September 2012.
- [50] L. is currently  in kindergarten and B. is in Grade 2 at Q. Elementary  School, which is located about two blocks from the West 5th Avenue  property. L.'s kindergarten comprises a full  school day.
- [51] I  will  refer below to additional evidence not contained in the claimant's written summary to the extent  it is relevant  to the various issues in these proceedings.

## IV DIVORCE

- [52] There will be an order, subject to section 12 of the Divorce Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2d supp.), that the parties be divorced. There will also be an order that the claimant's name be changed to J.E.S.

## V GUARDIANSHIP AND PARENTING SCHEDULE

## A. Introduction

- [53] There are two issues to be determined under this heading. Firstly,  what parenting schedule  is in the best interests of the children?  Secondly,  should joint guardianship be ordered on the Joyce model with the plaintiff entitled to make final decisions on major issues if the parties are unable to agree and with the respondent entitled to have such decisions reviewed by the court?

## B. The Applicable Principles

- [54] Sections 16(8)-(10) of the Divorce Act provide:

Factors

- (8) In making an order under this section, the court shall take into consideration only the best interests of the child of the marriage as

determined by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the child.

## Past conduct

- (9) In making an order under this section, the court shall not take into consideration the past conduct of any person unless the conduct is relevant to the ability of that person to act as a parent of a child.

## Maximum contact

(10) In making an order under this section, the court shall give effect to the principle that a child of the marriage should have as much contact with each spouse as is consistent with the best interests of the child and, for that purpose, shall take into consideration the willingness of the person for whom custody is sought to facilitate such contact.

## [55] The Family Relations Act provides in part:

## Best interests of child are paramount

- 24 (1) When making, varying or rescinding an order under this Part, a court must give paramount consideration to the best interests of the child and, in assessing those interests, must consider the following factors and give emphasis to each factor according to the child's needs and circumstances:
- (a) the health and emotional well being of the child including any special needs for care and treatment;
- (b) if appropriate, the views of the child;
- (c) the love, affection and similar ties that exist between the child and other persons;
- (d) education and training for the child;
- (e) the capacity of each person to whom guardianship, custody or access rights and duties may be granted to exercise those rights and duties adequately.
- (1.1) The references to "other persons" in subsection (1) (c) and to "each person" in subsection (1) (e) include parents, grandparents, other relatives of the child and persons who are not relatives of the child.

. . .

- (3) If the conduct of a person does not substantially affect a factor set out in subsection (1) or (2), the court must not consider that conduct in a proceeding respecting an order under this Part.
- (4) If under subsection (3) the conduct of a person may be considered by a court, the court must consider the conduct only to the extent that the conduct affects a factor set out in subsection (1) or (2).

. . .

## Jurisdiction to make custody or access orders

- 35 (1) Subject to Part 3, a court may, on application, order that one or more persons may exercise custody over a child or have access to the child.

- (1.1) The reference to "persons" in subsection (1) includes parents, grandparents, other relatives of the child and persons who are not relatives of the child.
- (2) An order for access may be made whether or not a custody order is made.
- (3) If a person has not received notice of a proceeding or has not been given opportunity to be heard in the proceeding, custody must not be granted to that person.
- (4) An order for custody or access may include terms and conditions the court considers necessary and reasonable in the best interests of the child.
- (5) An access order referred to in section 54.2 (3) of the Child, Family and Community Service Act is, for the purposes of this Act, an order for access made under this section.
- [56] Although  the parties have agreed to joint custody  and guardianship, in Gordon v. Goertz ,  [1996] 2 S.C.R. 27, the Supreme Court of Canada set out the following  criteria that also relate to parenting  time, an issue very  much in dispute in this case:
-  a parent's conduct 'can be considered only  if relevant  to his or her ability to act as parent of the child' (para. 23);
-  the best interests of the children are the only consideration and the interests of the parents are no longer relevant  in custody  determinations.  The individual child's best interests must be found  within the practical context  of the reality of the parents' lives and circumstances (para. 46) and the child's siblings, extended family  and community  (para. 44);
-  the child's needs and the parents' ability to meet those needs are the focus of the inquiry (para. 43);
-  there are no presumptions and the unique  situation of the individual child must be carefully  considered (para. 44).
- [57] In M.A.C. v. K.B. , 2002 BCSC 1201, Burnyeat J. stated:

[34] In dealing with the question of the appropriate primary residence of a child, the question to be asked is the same as would be asked if the application dealt with custody or access - what is in the best interests of the child. In Gordon v. Goertz , [1996] 2 S.C.R. 27 (S.C.C.), McLachlin, J., as she then was, addressed the test applicable to an application to vary custody and stated that, once a material change in circumstances was demonstrated, custody and access was to be considered afresh in light of all of the present circumstances and after a consideration of the child's best interests. McLachlin, J. summarized the law that was applicable to a case that was

before the Court including the requirement of showing a material change in circumstances and a request by one parent to relocate. After removing the principles which do not apply to the case at bar, the following principles laid out by McLachlin, J. apply to the case at bar:

2. ... the judge on the application must embark on a fresh inquiry into what is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all the relevant circumstances relating to the child's needs and the ability of the respective parents to satisfy them. ...
4. The inquiry does not begin with a legal presumption in favour of the custodial parent, although the custodial parent's views are entitled to great respect.
5. Each case turns on its own unique circumstances. The only issue is the best interest of the child in the particular circumstances of the case.
6. The focus is on the best interests of the child, not the interests and rights of the parents.
7. More particularly the judge should consider, inter alia :
6. (a) the existing custody arrangement and relationship between the child and the custodial parent;
7. (b) the existing access arrangement and the relationship between the child and the access parent;
8. (c) the desirability of maximizing contact between the child and both parents; ...
9. (f) disruption to the child of a change in custody;
10. (g) disruption to the child consequent on removal from family, schools, and the community he or she has come to know. (at pp. 60-61)

[Emphasis added.]

[58] In  so far as decision-making authority  is concerned, the applicable principles can be summarized as follows:

-  there has been a general unwillingness  to impose mandatory  joint decisionmaking on parents who cannot get along and are unable to communicate. This is out of concern  for the well-being  of the children;
-  the ability of the parents to communicate  and cooperate remains an important factor when  considering the best interests of a child:

Jordan v. Jordan , 2001 BCSC 1058 at para. 20

-  joint guardianship with no ultimate  decision-maker may not be appropriate on the basis that the cost and delay of applying to court each time the parents cannot  agree is not warranted.  Ultimately  a decision has to be made. In  such

circumstances,  the primary caregiver is best able to make the decision after making an effort to seek a consensus  with the other parent:

Andrew-Reed v. Reed , 2002 BCSC 513 at paras. 17-18

-  a particular  parent's understanding  of the general and special needs of a child, such as autism spectrum disorders, is a factor which can be taken into account  with respect to custody,  guardianship,  where the primary residence should  be and which parent should  have the ultimate decision-making power:

M.H.K.J. v. K.J.J. ,  2011 BCSC 1673 at paras. 78-82

-  final decision-making authority  can be ordered in situations to avoid continuing  conflict  due to the level  of acrimony between the parents:

S.M.M. v. J.P.H. , 2011 BCSC 1084 at para. 227

-  the Joyce model of guardianship may well be appropriate if the court  is satisfied the primary custodial parent will in fact consult  and seek the input of the other parent prior to making major decisions:

Chin v. Frass , 2011 BCSC 272 at para. 29

- [59] In Reis v. Bucholtz , 2010 BCCA 115 at para. 28, the Court of Appeal noted that the term 'primary parent':

is often used by the courts to describe the parent who is responsible for the day-to-day care of the child. It is not intended to denigrate the role of the other parent, but to recognize an assignment of responsibility.

- [60] As for shared parenting, the court can take into account:
2.  the devotion, love and consideration of the parents notwithstanding  the acrimony between them:

M.T.J. v. D.M.D. , 2012 BCSC 863 at paras. 151-152

-  the number of transitions  from home to home which the children will face: Merriman v. Merriman ,  2012 BCSC 757 at para. 16
-  the fact it may not be appropriate or necessary  to declare a primary residence. Week on/week off access provides for the important principle of maximum contact with both parents who are devoted to their children.  It  also reduces the number  of transitions during the week and provides certainty  for the children and their parents:

R.D.L.J. v. D.S.J. ,  2011 BCSC 1721 at para. 18

-  the role each parent has taken in the lives of the children  is an important consideration when determining their residence:

S.S.L. v. J.W.W. ,  2010 BCCA 55 at para. 32

-  the principal which promotes maximum  contact between the children and each parent does not necessarily mean equal time or alternative  weeks is the ultimate goal:

C.J.D. v. M.R.D. , 2004 BCSC 1513 at para. 41

[61] In E.L.S. v. C.A.S. , 2012 BCSC 1224, Pearlman J. summarized the principles this way:

[36] The court must determine custody and access based only on the best interests of the children, having regard to their condition, means, needs and other circumstances specific to their particular case. There is no presumption in favour of the status quo: Nunweiler v. Nunweiler ,  2000 BCCA 300. Nor is there any presumption in favour of joint or sole custody. In each case the only issue is the best interests of the particular child, which must be determined in the particular circumstances of that case: Robinson v. Flyk , (1996) 28 B.C.L.R. (3d) 21 at paras. 28-30 (C.A.).

[37] Similarly, where parents are in conflict and have difficulty communicating with each other, the court must in each case determine whether sole or joint custody is in the best interests of the children. In M. (S. M.) v. H. (J.P.) , 2011 BCSC 1084, the level of acrimony was such that court concluded at para. 227 that the only way to avoid continuing conflict was to give one parent the authority to make final decisions in the best interests of the children. Conversely, as L. Smith J observed in T. (V.E.) v. T. (C.E.), 2009 BCSC 444 at para. 92:

[92]   Since the decision in Robinson v. Filyk , the courts of British Columbia have demonstrated a willingness to award joint custody and joint guardianship even in cases where there is acrimony and a lack of cooperation between parties, if the court concludes that such an arrangement is in the best interests of the child: see Carr v. Carr , 2001 BCCA 415, 18 R.F.L. (5th) 254; Z. (E.) v. N. (S.) , 2007 BCSC 471; T. (R.S.) v. T. (R.S.) , 2008 BCSC 890.

## C. The Parties' Positions; Discussion and Analysis

[62] The claimant's position is that the parties should share joint custody and guardianship of B. and L., with the claimant retaining final decision-making responsibility on the Joyce model. In so far as the appropriate parenting  schedule is concerned,  she submits that the current  parenting schedule should  essentially

continue,  with Mr. H. having  access on alternating  weekends and midweek. This would minimize the need for changes to the schedule.  She proposes:

Week One:

No scheduled parenting time

Week Two:

Thursday 5:00 pm to Monday 9:00 am or Friday 5:00 pm to Tuesday at 9:00 am

Week Three:

No scheduled parenting time

Week Four:

Thursday 5:00 pm to Monday 9:00 am or Friday 5:00 pm to Tuesday 9 am

- [63] Mrs. H. also proposes that during Weeks One and Three  in which there is no parenting time scheduled for Mr. H., that he would  be entitled to a minimum of one evening  visit from after school or a scheduled  activity until  7:00 p.m., together  with any additional visits as may be agreed to between the parties.
- [64] The claimant submits that her parenting  schedule should  be adopted and the equal parenting proposed by the respondent  is not in the children's best interests for the following reasons:
3. (a) Ms. H. has been the children's primary parent both during the marriage and since the separation. There is no compelling reason for that to change;
4. (b) the children are still young and need a primary home;
5. (c) Ms. H. is available for the children during the week;
6. (d) Ms. H. is the more nurturing parent and her parenting style is best suited for the children at their young ages;
7. (e) Mr. H. has not been able to successfully manage the interim parenting schedules;
8. (f) Mr. H.'s travel;
9. (g) Mr. H.'s overreliance on third party caregivers is not conducive to equal parenting time;
10. (h) Mr. H.'s lifestyle is not conducive to equal parenting and he has been less inclined historically to commit to making the children a priority than has Ms. H.;
11. (i) Mr. H.'s use of alcohol;
12. (j) the parties' inability to effectively communicate is not conducive to equal parenting time.

[65] It  is the respondent's submission that the claimant's position, both with respect to final decision-making authority  and the parenting  schedule,  is incompatible with the joint custody arrangement  agreed to between the parties. Relying  on Anson v. Anson (1987), 10 B.C.L.R. (2d) 357 (Co. Ct.), he submits that since joint custody means the parents jointly  share the 'full  bundle  of rights and responsibilities', there cannot  be joint custody on the one hand  with final decisionmaking authority  to one parent on the other.

[66] The respondent  accepts that the claimant was the primary caregiver during the marriage, which included her being responsible for the scheduling  of the children's activities and B.'s therapies. He submits, however,  that the issue before the court is which parenting plan is in the children's best interests moving  forward. He seeks equal parenting time.

[67] The respondent  acknowledges that  he has been obliged to travel  for considerable periods of time in the past. This was required in order for him to succeed in his profession and to earn significant income and accumulate  assets that have benefited the family over the years.

[68] The respondent's position is that he is now able to restrict his travel.  He wishes to assume the role of being an equal parent to his children.  That  is why  he purchased a residence a short walk away from the West 5th Avenue  property. He is now able to arrange his business activities in order to be in Vancouver  for his children  two weeks out of every  month.

[69] He also submits an equal parenting schedule  is the children's best interests because:

-  although  his structured  parenting  style is very  different from the claimant's, the claimant's 'over nurturing'  style  has resulted in B.'s behaviour  often being 'out-of-control',  which she is incapable of addressing;
-  according to Ms. A., who was the children's primary nanny  for many  years but is now the children's nanny  only when  they  are with the respondent,  B.'s 'meltdowns'  are very  few when  he is parented by his father;

-  Ms. A's evidence was to the effect that  B.'s aggressive behaviour directed towards his sister and others was something the claimant was unable  to control.  She also testified that the claimant did not deal with these episodes but rather left it to her to address;
-  although  the claimant asserts she no longer requires help with the children there was evidence she has assistance from her boyfriend M.J., friends and nannies;
-  he will be able as a result of the changes he has made to his work schedule to attend meetings with therapists, teachers,  etc., on a regular basis.
- [70] The parties have made accusations against the other pertaining to lifestyle issues, deficiencies in parenting and the like. Suffice it to say that both of them have at times acted in a manner  towards the other they  now regret. I need not repeat the details in these reasons for judgment  because I do not view them to be relevant  with respect to what is in the children's best interests moving forward.
- [71] I  make the following  findings of fact in relation to what  is in the children's best interests, both with respect to the appropriate parenting schedule  and whether  the Joyce model of guardianship is warranted  in this case.
- (a) it is clear that both parties love their children  and are willing to do what is needed to provide them with the most positive environment  possible to maximize their best interests;
- (b) the parties and the children  live a very  privileged lifestyle.  Both parties reside in valuable  residences just a short distance from each other.  The children  want for nothing  in either residence;
- (c) the parties have the financial ability to provide whatever  the children require from an academic and extracurricular  perspective. For B. this includes therapies for his autism;
- (d) the children are still young with B. and L. being eight and six years old respectively;
- (e) for most of their childhood, the children have been used to their father being absent from Vancouver  on business for extended periods of time. They have also been accustomed to their mother being the primary caregiver;
- (f)  the claimant has acquired significant knowledge with respect to parenting an autistic child;

- (g) the parties clearly  have different parenting  styles but the children  appear to benefit from both approaches.

[72] In  reaching my conclusions  with respect to these issues, I was not assisted by the evidence of Ms. A. I have no doubt she has been an excellent  care provider for the children for many  years. She had a very  close relationship with the claimant for several years. This, however,  came to an end when  the claimant apparently  made certain accusations regarding Ms. A., which she now regrets. Ms. A. then became the children's primary nanny  during the periods when  they  were residing with their father.

- [73] Ms. A. receives significant personal benefits as a result of this arrangement, including  the use of a luxury  motor vehicle  and the opportunity  to travel with the respondent,  members of his family and the children.  I did not find her to be an unbiased witness.
- [74] I  was also not assisted by the evidence of the claimant's close friends. I viewed their attempts to portray  the respondent  in an unfavorable  light,  including the alleged overuse of alcohol,  to be motivated more by loyalty  to the claimant than  a real interest in providing unbiased evidence.
- [75] I  did find the claimant's boyfriend,  M.J., to be a credible witness in so far as his evidence with respect to the children is concerned.  He and the claimant have been in a relationship  for one-and-a half to two years. He has professional experience in dealing with autistic children.  He is considering a career with the Vancouver Police. He is obviously  attached to the children and has bonded with them in a positive manner.
- [76] The respondent's girlfriend did not testify  at the trial.
- [77] When I apply my findings of fact to the legal principles, I have concluded that an equal parenting schedule  is not yet in the best interests of the children.  This is due to their ages, the ability of the claimant to dedicate her time each day to them

and B.'s special needs including his challenges  in coping with changes in his daily schedule.  He requires consistency  and a routine.

[78] Furthermore,  at the present time the respondent is still not in a position 'to replicate the engaged, consistent and involved  parenting role currently  occupied by the mother': Hosseini v. Kazemi , 2011 BCSC 1130 at para. 21.

[79] In  the circumstances  of this case, it is my view that to move to an equal parenting arrangement  at the present time is too much,  too soon to be in the children's best interests. A move to equal parenting should  be taken in stages.

[80] The current  arrangement,  however,  is no longer in the children's best interests, keeping in mind the changes the respondent  is prepared to make to his work schedule.

[81] Accordingly,  taking into account  the fact that the respondent  will still be required to travel  on a regular basis, I order the parenting schedule  to be as follows. The children  will reside three weeks per month  with the claimant,  one week per month with the respondent.  The respondent's week-long access will commence on the Friday and end when  they are taken to school a week from the following Monday. This will provide nine consecutive  days (and 10 nights) for the children  to be with their father and will result  in the weekends being shared equally  between the parents, as is currently  the case. It will also reduce the transitions from one parent to the other.

[82] In  addition, during the three weeks the children reside with the claimant,  the respondent  will have parenting  time with the children one day, mid-week, from after school or a scheduled extracurricular  activity until  7:00 p.m. The claimant will have similar mid-week parenting time during the week the children are with their father.

[83] This parenting schedule will remain in place for a minimum of two years from the date of these reasons for judgment,  although  it can be varied by consent  of the parties.

[84] It  is in the children's best interests that they  are aware, with as much advanced notice as possible, which week and weekends they  will be residing with the respondent.  Accordingly, I direct that the parties attempt to reach an agreement for periods of a minimum  of three months  at a time. In addition, they  are to attempt to reach an agreement with respect to school holidays,  Christmas and spring break vacations as well as statutory  holidays. If  they are unable to agree, then  I direct they attend mediation for that purpose prior to any applications being brought.

[85] I  am not prepared to make an order for joint guardianship based on the Joyce model. Although  it has been difficult in the past for the parties to agree on some issues, they  have been able to reach a consensus  on many occasions in order to accommodate their respective schedules,  particularly  the respondent's.

[86] I t  is my expectation that with the conclusion  of this proceeding, the parties will be better able to agree as to what  is in their children's best interests, particularly in so far as major decisions are concerned.  If they  are unable  to do so, I order that they  attend mediation prior to any applications being brought.

- [87] The costs of any mediation are to be shared equally.

[88] Neither party sought  leave to make supplementary  submissions on the issues of guardianship and the parenting schedule based on the Family Law Act , S.B.C. 2011, c. 25, which came into force on March 18, 2013. I have considered the provisions of Part 4 of the Family Law Act and in particular sections 37, and 39 to 43 inclusive.  Keeping in mind the paramountcy  of the applicable principles in the Divorce Act (which  do not apply to guardianship),  I would  have reached the same conclusions  with respect to the children's  best interests  regardless of whether  the Family Relations Act or the Family Law  Act applied to the circumstances  of this case.

## VI DIVISION OF FAMILY ASSETS

## A. Introduction

- [89] I  am required to consider the appropriate division of assets prior to the question of support.
- [90] The value  of the family assets is considerable, being over $8 million excluding stock options that have a potential additional value  in excess of $1 million to each party.
- [91] The date of the triggering event  is September 12, 2011, being that of the section 57 declaration.
- [92] The assets include the West 5th Avenue  property,  the West 3rd Avenue property and the Whistler property.
- [93] The claimant seeks reapportionment  of the family assets together with a compensation payment of approximately  $894,000. This includes $175,000 in relation to stock options which the respondent exercised in 2011.

[94] The compensation payment sought also includes an amount  of approximately $150,000 pertaining to the disposal of two potential family assets being:

-  $63,000 representing  50% of an ICBC payout of $126,000 for a 2005 Aston Martin;
-  $84,939 representing  50% of a Scotiabank GIC that was liquidated by the respondent  in April 2012.
- [95] The parties agree that the stock options in existence at the date of the triggering event  of September 12, 2011, be held in trust  by Mr. H. to be divided when they  are exercised by him. The claimant does not seek any  interest in any stock options acquired by the respondent  after that date.

## B. The Applicable Principles

[96] Section 58 of the Family Relations Act defines 'family  asset' as property owned by one or both spouses that  is 'ordinarily used' for a family  purpose and includes 'a right, share or interest of a spouse any venture  to which money  or money's worth  was, directly or indirectly,  concluded by or on behalf of the other spouse'.

[97] The equal division found  in the Family Relations Act is based on a presumption  that there has been a joint contribution  by spouses. The concept of contribution  is to be viewed broadly and may be financial or by way of child care, household  management or other activities that promote the family unit.  Contribution is but one of many factors in determining whether  reapportionment  is warranted, should  an equal division be found as unfair:

Bawtinheimer v. Bawtinheimer (1985), 68 B.C.L.R. 234 at paras. 18-19 (C.A.)

Elsom v. Elsom ,  [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1367 at para. 21

[98] Joyce J., in N.M.M. v. N.S.M ., 2004 BCSC 346 at para. 76, summarized the principles which apply to the division of family  assets:

1. Because it is the triggering event that gives each spouse a prima facie equal interest as tenants in common in each family asset the circumstances as they exist at that date are to be considered in determining whether the prima facie equal division would be unfair.
2. Generally speaking, the spouses will share any increase or decrease in value of a family asset that occurs after the triggering event because their interests in the asset have vested.
3. Valuation  at the date of trial is generally appropriate when considering the mechanism under s.66 to achieve the division of family assets, for example by dividing the assets in species by vesting the various assets in the names of the parties or by vesting an asset in the name of one party in exchange for an order compensating the other for the divested interest.
4. While generally the appropriate date for valuing family assets will be the trial date it appears there is discretion to fix another date, not earlier than the triggering event, if that is necessary in order to achieve fairness.

5. Discretion may exist to reapportion assets or to vest title in one spouse while awarding the other compensation taking into account events following the triggering event where, for example, the conduct of one party alone has caused the asset to increase or decrease in value and it would create unfairness and injustice if those events were ignored.
6. Where it is established that one spouse has disposed of a family asset or caused it to decrease significantly in value it is open to the court to order compensation for that loss. Such a compensation order will be based on the loss in value and will necessarily involve determining the value of the asset prior to the loss.
- [99] Regarding reapportionment,  the court  is empowered to reapportion either individual family assets or all family  assets if it finds that  equal division would be unfair having  regard to the factors listed in s. 65(1)(a)-(f)  of the Family Relations Act, which are:
4. (a) the duration of the marriage,
5. (b) the duration of the period during which the spouses have lived separate and apart,
6. (c) the date when property was acquired or disposed of,
7. (d) the extent to which property was acquired by one spouse through inheritance or gift,
8. (e) the needs of each spouse to become or remain economically independent and self sufficient, or
9. (f) any other circumstances relating to the acquisition, preservation, maintenance, improvement or use of property or the capacity or liabilities  of a spouse.
- [100] Furthermore,  pursuant  to section 65(1)(e), the court can take the following factors into account:
11. (a) diminished earning capacity and loss of economic opportunity suffered by one spouse due to homemaking and childcare duties: Lodge v. Lodge (1993), 79 B.C.L.R. (2d) 360 at paras. 19-22 (C.A.);
12. (b) the past earnings and future earning capacity of each spouse and the contributions made by one spouse to the enhancement of the earning capacity of the other spouse due to homemaking and childcare: Toth v. Toth (1995), 13 B.C.L.R. (3d) at paras. 44-46 (C.A.);
13. (c) the fact that one spouse has better income-earning prospects as well as a significant difference in earnings that would continue into the future: Davies v. Davies (1999), 50 R.F.L. (4 th ) 353 at paras. 30-32 (B.C.S.C.); M.R.M. v. I.M.M. , 2006 BCSC 568 at paras. 41-46; Ashlie v. Ashlie , 2010 BCSC 1101 at para. 27;

- (d) ongoing responsibility for children and the need by a spouse to retain a home for the benefit of children: Lanaway v. Lanaway (1983), 37 R.F.L. (2d) 214 at 216 (B.C.C.A.); Kennedy v. Kennedy (1994), 98 B.C.L.R. (2d) 287 at para. 22 (S.C.);
- (e) the impact of ongoing responsibility for a child with special needs, particularly its impact on a return to work for a spouse in their 40s and 50s: L.A.L. v. R.L. , 2005 BCSC 1776 at para. 45; Gagnon v. Petke , 2008 BCSC 610 at para. 91;
- (f)  the need to keep a home to provide stability for children and lessen the impact of divorce and provide a capital investment to the dependent spouse to assist with economic self-sufficiency: T.M.S. v. E.S. , 2004 BCSC 477 at para. 26.
- [101] Under section 65(1)(f),  the court can take into account the pre-marriage cohabitation of the parties: Piskor v. Piskor (1981), 27 B.C.L.R. 230 at 233 (C.A.), Sangster v. Sangster (1984), 55 B.C.L.R. 251 at 256 (C.A.).

[102] Section 65(1)(f) of the Family Relations Act has been described in Piskor as the 'basket clause':

Under this heading one must consider the substance of the relationship and the respective contributions of the parties, including their respective contributions during the . . . period of cohabitation prior to the marriage . . . (at p. 233).

- [103] The onus is on the party seeking reapportionment  to establish that the equal division of the family  assets would  be unfair having  regard to the factors enumerated in section 65: Toth v. Toth at para. 62.
- [104] The rationale for the court first addressing property issues before support is set out by Prowse J.A. in Tedham v. Tedham ,  2005 BCCA 502 at para. 67:

. . . in approaching issues of division of property and spousal support, the court should first address the division of property, including any issue of reapportionment, and then address the issue of spousal support. One practical reason for this approach is that the division of property, particularly where there is reapportionment, will affect the relative condition, means and needs of the parties, not the least because it may generate further income in the hands of the payee.

[105] There can, however,  be an interrelationship  between apportionment  of family assets and spousal support.  Distribution of the economic consequences can be achieved by spousal and child support, by the division of property and assets or by

combination of the two: Moge v. Moge , [1992] 3 S.C.R. 813 at 849; Hartshorne v. Hartshorne , 2004 SCC 22 at para. 54.

[106] The different goals of reapportionment  on the one hand and spousal support on the other were described this way in T.M.S. v. E.S. :

Thus the economic disadvantage the plaintiff has suffered has both a shortterm and a long-term impact. The short-term impact can be addressed by spousal maintenance, but the long-term impact should be addressed by a reapportionment of assets.

See also Lodge v. Lodge at paras. 18-21.

[107] Stock options have been held to be family assets, including  those acquired post-separation and prior to the date of the triggering event:

Kennedy v. Stoughton , 1996 B.C.J. No.1808 at para. 27

Sarro v. Sarro ,  2011 BCSC 1010 at para. 11

## C. The Parties' Positions; Discussion and Analysis

[108] The claimant seeks a 65% reapportionment  of the West 5th Avenue  property in her favour.  She submits this is required in order to assist her in establishing economic independence and self-sufficiency,  particularly  in light of B.'s special needs. In that regard, she says there is a real likelihood that B. may never  be able to live independently.  She believes he may have to continue  living with her once he is an adult.

[109] A 65% reapportionment of this property would provide the claimant with approximately  $2.437 million and the respondent  $1.31 million, that  is, the claimant would receive an additional amount of approximately  $1.1 million.

## [110] In  the claimant's closing submissions, she submits the following:

282. In order to effect reapportionment of the family residence, and the other family assets to take into account debts incurred by the Claimant for a family purpose and funds disposed of by Mr. H. prior to trial, Ms. H. proposes that she retain the following assets as her sole and separate property:

- a. the property at . . . West 5 th Avenue, Vancouver with a value of $3,750,000.00;
- b. the property at . . ., Whistler, provided that she receives cash assets sufficient to enable her to reduce the mortgage on the Whistler property to a manageable level;
- c. Toyota Sequoia vehicle;
- d. bank and investment accounts in her name; and
- e. all other personal property in her possession.

283. Ms. H. proposes that Mr. H. retain his home located at . . . West 3 rd Avenue, Vancouver, the H. Family Trust, his corporate interests and all other assets in his name.

284. To effect a division of assets, Ms. H. suggests that Mr. H. make a compensatory payment in the amount of $894,193 . 00, calculated as follows:

[111] The claimant's reconciliation is based on the following:

-  a 65% reapportionment  of the West 5th Avenue  property in her favour;
-  the equal division of all remaining assets including the Whistler property (allocated to the claimant),  the L. Royalty  share options, Scotiabank GIC and Aston Martin ICBC proceeds (allocated to the respondent);
-  the respondent being solely responsible for the 2011 tax debt of approximately  $627,000.

[112] The respondent's position is that the family assets and debts ought  to be divided equally  between the parties. He submits reapportionment  has not been ordered in situations similar to this case, that is, where there will be an asset division of $8 million or more and where there is considerable income that will provide for both needs-based and compensatory spousal support.

[113] He submits the assets should  be divided in the manner set out in Schedule A and Schedule B of his closing submissions. This would result  in a compensation payment by him to the claimant in the amount of $66,410.

- [114] To place the parties' submissions in their proper context  the following  issues need to be considered.
- [115] As noted at paragraph 93 above, the claimant seeks a compensation payment of $175,000 in relation to certain stock options. This arises from the respondent  receiving approximately  $350,000 when  he exercised certain L. Royalty share options in 2011, that is after the separation but prior to the triggering event.  As is set out in the claimant's closing submissions:
256. The factors which support a compensation payment equal to 50% of the net income derived from the exercise of the L. Royalty options are as follows:

- a. The acquisition of options and the resulting sale of shares were a source of funds for the family during the marriage;
- b. L. Royalty was not a new business venture that came into existence after the marriage. It flowed from Mr. H.'s involvement in L. Copper since 2004;
- c. It was Ms. H.'s work in the home and with the children that freed Mr. H. to pursue business opportunities, which generated compensation benefits such as options. In a long term relationship such as this, it is fair that Ms. H. share in the fruits of their economic partnership;
- d. Had Mr. H. not exercised the options, which he did without the consent of Ms. H., the options would have been a family asset shareable by Ms. H.

[116] The respondent  submits there should  be no payment  made with respect to the exercise of these options. Between his professional income and the exercise of share options, an amount  in excess of $1 million went into the bank accounts, which were used for family  purposes in both 2010 and 2011. This is in addition to the $1.62 million which paid off the West 5th Avenue  property mortgage.  The claimant has already received the benefit of a significant portion of the income generated by these stock options.

- [117] The claimant is correct when  she asserts, based on certain legal authorities such as Newson v. Newson (1986), 3 B.C.L.R. (2d) 1 (C.A.), and C.F.G. v. A.A.G. , 2006 BCSC 904, that the income generated with respect to the exercise of these options could, under  certain circumstances,  support a compensation  payment.
- [118] In  my view, that would not be appropriate in the circumstances.  I accept the respondent's submission that the claimant  has already  significantly  benefited from the income generated by these stock options.
- [119] Relying  on Newson ,  the claimant also seeks compensation in the amount  of $147,939 for the disposal of the two potential family assets referred to in paragraph 94 above.
- [120] In  so far as the insurance  payment  for the Aston Martin is concerned,  the vehicle was acquired with funds  generated during the marriage and prior to the date

of the triggering event.  Accordingly, the claimant is prima facie entitled to the amount claimed. It was the respondent's evidence, however,  that  these funds  were applied entirely  towards his 2011 tax debt of approximately  $627,000.

[121] The approximate amount of $85,000, which represents one-half  of the Scotiabank GIC liquidated in April 2012 was also, prima facie , a family asset. It would not appear those funds were specifically applied to the 2011 tax debt, but the respondent  did borrow $500,000 in that regard. The borrowed funds  and the insurance  proceeds are approximately  equivalent  to the 2011 tax debt.

- [122] The claimant's position is she should not be responsible for 50% of the respondent's 2011 tax obligation. In  her written submission she states:

The court can only reapportion assets to account for family debts if the spouse seeking reapportionment has applied for it. Although the respondent did file a counterclaim he did not seek a reapportionment based on this debt. Accordingly the court has no jurisdiction to provide the respondent the relief he seeks. See Shambrook v. Shambrook 2004 BC SC 872 at paras. 40 to 43 and Best v. Best , 2009 BCSC 928 at para. 10-14.

- [123] In  the alternative,  it is the claimant's position that  the respondent  had ample funds  in 2011 to pay the debt after deducting expenditures  that  benefited the claimant.  This is seen by counsel's letter dated August  30, 2012, to the effect the respondent  had the use of $4.946 million in both taxable and non-taxable  income. Approximately  $2.1 million of this amount  was non-taxable  capital distributions.

[124] The claimant  argues the respondent was still left with approximately $980,500 from which to pay his taxes after payments  were made that benefited the claimant,  including paying off the West 5th Avenue  mortgage debt and $525,000 for renovations  to that property.  The expenditures  made by the respondent  with respect to the West 5th Avenue  property benefitted both parties since they relate to family assets shareable by them.

- [125] The claimant also submits that  although  the respondent  was entitled to purchase a residence of his choice, she should not be responsible for the financial consequences of his decision to purchase  a property for $4.6 million. He should

have led evidence including  real estate listings to the effect that the price he paid to purchase a home to be close to his children was reasonable under the circumstances.

[126] In  response, Mr. H. submits he is entitled to raise the issue of family debts without  a specific plea to that effect. That  is because the claimant has raised the matter of reapportionment.  This is sufficient for the court to address all issues pertaining to reapportionment:  see Stein v. Stein , 2008 SCC 35. The  claimant has also known  for some time the respondent's position with respect to the tax debt and is not prejudiced in any way by the respondent  raising this issue at trial.

[127] The respondent  argues the claimant is attempting to reap the benefits of his 2011 income without  the burden of the statutorily  imposed tax. This is unjust  and unfair.

- [128] In  so far as his choice of residence is concerned,  he submits he purchased a home with equity  of just  over $1 million in order to provide a suitable home for himself and his children.  It  was reasonable for him to do so in order to be in close proximity to where they  would be primarily living.
- [129] I  have concluded that  the respondent's 2011 tax debt is a matter that I can properly take into account  when I consider the claimant's claim for reapportionment of the family  assets.
- [130] First of all, I do not accede to the claimant's submission that, on the technical basis of a lack of pleading, this issue is not properly before the court. The issue of reapportionment  has been raised and pursued by the claimant. She is in no way taken by surprise by the respondent's  position on this issue.
- [131] Secondly,  from a substantive  perspective, I agree with the respondent that it would be inequitable for the claimant to have received substantial  benefits from the respondent's 2011 income without  the tax debt on that income being taken into account.

- [132] This is particularly  the case when I consider the claimant's submission that the respondent's 2011 income (in so far as payments  made with respect to the West 5th Avenue property  are concerned)  'relate[s] to family assets which are shareable by both parties'. And yet, the gist of her submission with respect to the respondent's purchase of the West 3rd property  is that it was extravagant  and unreasonable.
- [133] These arguments,  in my view, are contradictory.  Both the claimant's and respondent's submissions with respect to the appropriate division of family assets are based on the respondent's equity in the West 3rd Avenue  property being a family asset. To that extent,  the respondent's acquisition of the property was also an expenditure  benefitting the claimant in that it related to assets 'shareable by both parties'.
- [134] The next  issue to be considered is the respondent's contingent  tax liability. The respondent  has been advised by L. Group's ('L.G.')  tax counsel  that he may be subject to a contingent  tax debt depending on the outcome of an ongoing audit of L.G. which involves  a CRA determination as to whether  L.G. ought to have declared profit from its business operations as capital gains as opposed to income. The audit was in its initial stages at the time of trial. The  outcome, including any  appeals, may take several years before it is known.
- [135] The respondent's position is to the effect this contingent  liability should  be taken into account in the apportionment  of assets between the parties. He relies on Stein v. Stein . There,  McLachlin C.J. stated:
- [5]    In my view, this appeal ought to be allowed. The FRA does not preclude an order dividing between spouses a contingent liability which cannot be valued at the time of trial, and this is not a case where the fact that both parties benefited from the tax shelters that could give rise to the contingent liabilities  is outweighed by other factors. The trial judge found that both Mr. and Mrs. Stein are financially stable, and that both benefited from these tax shelter instruments. As a result, fairness requires restoration of the original order that the contingent debt be shared equally between the parties.
- [136] The claimant agrees that  on the basis of Stein , the court can make an order adjusting  the division of assets at trial or in the future  to account  for a contingent

liability which  cannot be valued at the date of trial. It can also make a compensation order in relation to a contingent  liability or can reapportion a contingent  liability under section 65 of the Family Relations Act .

- [137] The claimant seeks to distinguish Stein , however,  on the basis that the contingent  liability in that case was the personal debt of the husband,  whereas here it is a potential debt of his holding company,  A. Investments  Ltd. She also submits that the fact the respondent will retain the shares in A. Investments  Ltd. provides him with the potential benefit of any future  increase in the value  the company. She does acknowledge that corporate liabilities may also accrue.
- [138] In  the alternative,  the claimant's position is that an equal sharing of the contingent  liability would be unfair  since the respondent  has a much  greater earning potential.
- [139] I  do not agree with the claimant's submission that since the contingent  debt is that of A. Investments  Ltd. and not the respondent's in his personal capacity, the principles in Stein do not apply. The respondent  is the sole shareholder  of H. Consulting,  the corporate entity that  is the receptacle for his income from L.G. It is not unusual  in family law cases for the court to pierce the corporate veil, thereby recognizing that a spouse cannot escape legal obligations through  the use of corporations. This statement of principle, for example, has been adopted by the Federal Child Support Guidelines , SOR/97-175 [Guidelines],  and the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines [Spousal Support Guidelines].  Section 18 of the Guidelines is a specific example.
- [140] I  do agree with the claimant,  however,  that an equal sharing of this contingent liability would  be unfair  due to the respondent's significant earning potential when compared to that  of the claimant.  In Stein , for example, the evidence was to the effect that the wife would  shortly  be self-supporting.  For the reasons below, that is clearly  not the case here.

- [141] I n Lightle v. Kotar , 2012 BCSC 1363 at para. 56, Mr. Justice Affleck ordered the husband's contingent  tax liability be apportioned two-thirds  to the husband and one-third  to the wife as a result of the husband's greater earning capacity.  In  my view the apportionment  in this case should  be 75% to the respondent  and 25% to the claimant.
- [142] The factors that apply to the claimant's claim for reapportionment  under section 65(1) are (a), (c), (e) and (f).
- [143] I  have concluded the claimant has established the basis for a reapportionment  of the family assets.
- [144] I n Lodge v. Lodge , Prowse J.A. stated:
- [18]   I am persuaded, however, that the learned trial judge was plainly wrong in failing  to reapportion the 91A Street property in Mrs. Lodge's favour under s. 51(e) of the Act. I come to this conclusion on the basis that the learned trial judge gave no consideration to the fact that Mrs. Lodge was out of the workforce raising the children and caring for the home for the better part of the 19 year marriage. His reasons fail to record the significance of the fact that, when the marriage ended, she was 40 years of age, with only a grade 12 education and limited and dated working skills. It is noteworthy that her anticipated income as of the date of trial was $1,000 per month. This is in stark contrast to her husband, who left the marriage with 19 years of experience in his trade and a variety of marketable skills he was able to accumulate during the marriage, in part at least, because Mrs. Lodge was taking primary responsibility for the children and the household. He took with him a successful business which, as already noted, was producing income in the range of $60,000 per year.
- [19]     In my view, the learned trial judge erred in approaching his analysis under s. 51(e) by focusing almost exclusively on whether Mrs. Lodge would be able to meet her current monthly expenses by a combination of her modest income, interest from projected investments, and maintenance from Mr. Lodge. While this type of analysis is appropriate to determine an adequate level of periodic maintenance, it completely overlooks the capital loss suffered by Mrs. Lodge during the marriage in terms of her ability to become and remain economically self-sufficient if and when the marriage came to an end.
- [20]     The fact that spouses, usually women, who stay at home to care for their children often suffer such a loss is now being recognized in the case law, frequently in relation to statutory provisions relating to maintenance. One expression of this loss is found in Moge v. Moge (1992), 43 R.F.L. (3d) 345 (S.C.C.), where, in considering the support provisions of the Divorce Act ,

1985, Madam Justice L'Heureux Dube, speaking for the majority, made the following comments at p. 389 of the decision:

The financial consequences of the end of a marriage extend beyond the simple loss of future earning power or losses directly related to the care of children. They will often encompass loss of seniority, missed promotions, and lack of access to fringe benefits, such as pension plans, life, disability, dental, and health insurance ... As persons outside of the workforce cannot take advantage of job retraining and the upgrading of skills provided by employers, one serious economic consequence of remaining out of the workforce is that the value of education and job training often decreases with each year in comparison to those who remain active in the workforce and may even become redundant after several years of non-use. All of these factors contribute to the inability of a person not in the labour force to develop economic security for retirement in his or her later years.

- [21]     Madam Justice McLachlin, in separate concurring reasons, adopted the following comments from the reasons for judgment of Twaddle J.A. in the Manitoba Court of Appeal, at p. 398 of the Moge decision:

## As Twaddle J.A. put it:

Depending on the duration of the marriage, and the wife's education and work experience, economic self-sufficiency may mean a permanent disadvantage from which the wife cannot recover. Having concentrated her efforts for many years on looking after the home, the husband and the children, the wife may have lost opportunities to learn, to train, to grow. Those lost opportunities may not be regainable.

The husband, in the meantime, may not only have earned a living for the family, or part of one, but also have expanded his knowledge and experience in work-related areas. He may have a higher earning potential than his wife because of their domestic arrangements.

- [145] Much of what  was said in Lodge applies to the claimant in this case:
2.  she is 41 years old;
3.  although  she has a Master's degree in Latin American Economic and Social History,  she has been out of the workforce for many  years. The parties agreed she would be the primary caregiver for the children and should  devote her time and energy  to the H. family such that the respondent  could focus on the development  of what has turned  out to be an extremely  successful  career;

-  both children are now of school age. L. is in kindergarten,  B. is in grade 2 and they  have many years of school ahead of them.  B. has special needs, which may well require the claimant to devote a considerable amount of her daily life to him, both before and after he reaches the age of majority;
-  while the claimant has commenced working on a part-time basis in a furniture store, her income, even if she were ultimately  able to work full-time  hours,  is nominal  in comparison to the respondent's income-earning  potential. I agree that her imputed income for support purposes will be $22,000. She clearly has no ability to become self-supporting  in the immediate future,  if ever. This is due in part to the specific knowledge and expertise that she has acquired over the years in relation to B.'s autism. She also recognizes her son may have to live with her indefinitely  after he reaches the age of majority.  This commitment to her son will likely be required for many years to come;
-  the respondent,  in part due to the significant contribution  by the claimant who has sacrificed her career for the benefit of the family, has been able to expand his knowledge and experience in his chosen profession. He has a much higher earning potential in the future  due in part to the domestic arrangements the couple made many years ago;
-  the claimant's ability to maintain the lifestyle  which she and the respondent have had will depend almost exclusively  on the family assets and financial support she receives as a result of these proceedings.

[146] The legal authorities  dealing with the range of reapportionment  in cases involving  a lengthy  marriage, a stay-at-home  mother  and a father  with an established career, are highly  fact specific. Cases that  have assisted me in reaching my conclusion  as to what is appropriate in this case include Foster v. Foster ,  2002 BCSC 188; Tedham v. Tedham ,  2003 BCCA 600; Barchuk v. Barchuk , 2003 BCSC 226; Nielsen v. Nielsen , 2005 BCSC 768; Gagnon v. Petke (a decision involving  a wife whose return  to work was unrealistic due to her son's special needs resulting from his autism);  and S.C. v. A. D. , 2009 BCSC 1749.

[147] I  note that  in none of these cases did the parties have assets available for apportionment  in the amounts  which  exist here. Chutter v. Chutter , 2008 BCCA 507, however,  is authority  for the proposition that a spouse who receives significant assets, in that case a 50% apportionment,  totalling $4 million,  is nonetheless  entitled to spousal support.  In  this proceeding, the respondent agrees the claimant is entitled to indefinite support based on both compensatory  and non-compensatory  grounds.

What he objects to is reapportionment  of the family assets in addition to the payment of indefinite spousal support.

- [148] I  have been referred to no legal authority  by the respondent supporting  his position that reapportionment  is not justified in this case due to the amount  of assets the claimant would receive upon an equal division and the payment  of indefinite spousal support.
- [149] In  my view, the considerations that apply to parties who are less financially advantaged than  Mr. and Mrs. H. should  also apply in this case such that  the objectives of both the Family Relations Act and the Divorce Act can be met.
- [150] There is a significant difference between the position of the parties in so far as reapportionment  of assets is concerned.  The net effect of the relief sought by the claimant is a compensation  payment of $894,193. The respondent says an equal apportionment  of the assets together with a payment  of $66,410 will result  in the claimant having  assets of approximately  $4.1 million not including  the value of the additional stock options, which  could result  in the claimant receiving an additional $1 million.
- [151] In  my view the amount  to be paid by the respondent  to the claimant  to compensate her for a reapportionment  of the family assets should  be based on the following  approach. I accept as a starting point the claimant's calculation  of a net compensation amount owing of approximately  $894,000. In  my view, a 65% reapportionment  of the West 5th Avenue  property in the claimant's favour  is appropriate in the circumstances  of this case. The amount  sought includes approximately  $175,000 for the L. Royalty  share options and approximately $150,000 for the Aston Martin insurance  and Scotiabank GIC proceeds. This amount should  then be reduced to take into account :
5.  my findings with respect to the L. Royalty  options;
6.  the Aston Martin insurance  proceeds which  were applied towards the respondent's 2011 tax debt;

-  the respondent accessed a line of credit to borrow $500,000 to retire the balance of the 2011 income tax debt;
-  in that regard I conclude that since both parties benefitted to a considerable degree from the respondent's  2011 income, it would be inequitable to have the respondent bear all the financial consequences  of the 2011 income tax debt. That  being the case, it would also be inequitable to have the respondent pay the plaintiff 50% of the funds  received from these two sources, even though  it would appear the Scotiabank GIC proceeds were not specifically used to pay the 2011 income tax debt. As noted above, Mr. H. did borrow $500,000 in that regard.

[152] The reduction is not intended to be based on a mathematical calculation  of these factors, including an apportionment  of the 2011 income tax debt. Rather it is an assessment of what I consider to be fair under the circumstances  in so far as reapportionment  is concerned.

- [153] Accordingly,  I have concluded the appropriate amount  to deduct from the amount sought by the claimant is $250,000, leaving a net compensation payment  of $644,193 which  I round  up to $645,000.

[154] The parties have agreed they  shall each retain the personal assets in their possession.

- [155] With the exception of the respondent's contingent  tax liability discussed above, each party is responsible for their own personal debts and liabilities.
- [156] In  making this reapportionment,  I have also considered the funds  received by the claimant from a personal friend, being M.S., in the amount  of $130,000. It was the claimant's evidence she received the funds after the date of separation during a timeframe when,  in her view, the respondent was not providing her with adequate spousal and child support.

[157] As part of his submissions that  a compensation order of $66,410 was appropriate, the respondent indicated he would not take the position these funds should  be included in the claimant's assets.

- [158] Since the compensation order I have made is well in excess of what was proposed by the respondent,  I wish to indicate I did not consider these funds  to be relevant  in my analysis of the issue of reapportionment  and the amount  of compensation I have ordered be paid by the respondent.  That is because the claimant's evidence was to the effect these funds were lent to her and she considered herself obliged to repay them.
- [159] The remaining issue pertaining to property is travel-related  benefits including air miles. The  claimant seeks an in specie equal division of those benefits to the time of the triggering event.  If those benefits are not divisible, then  she submits a trust order as was made by Davies J. in Russell v. Russell ,  2002 BCSC 1233, would be appropriate.
- [160] The respondent  acknowledges the claimant's entitlement  to these benefits in Schedule A to his submissions.
- [161] As was the case in Russell ,  I   am unable to determine with any precision what the claimant's entitlement  to these benefits is. In Russell , there was evidence of coexisting personal and corporate interests in the air miles account.  There  is no such evidence here.
- [162] Accordingly,  if the parties are unable  to agree as to the manner  in which the benefits are to be divided, the claimant  is entitled to a declaration that the respondent  holds 50% of the travel  benefits in question as at the date of the triggering event  in trust for her. He will be required to advise claimant's counsel of that amount  and will thereafter  be required to use those miles and travel benefits as directed by the claimant.
- [163] There will be a similar order in favour  of the respondent  with respect to any travel  benefits in the claimant's name as at that date.

## VII SPOUSAL AND CHILD SUPPORT

## A. The Respondent's Guideline Income

- [164] Section 16 of the Guidelines provides that guideline income is to be calculated  based on the sources of income in an individual's income tax return adjusted in accordance with Schedule III,  subject  to sections 17 to 20 of the Guidelines.
- [165] Sections 2(3) 3, 4, 16 and 17 of the Guidelines provide:

## Most current information

2. (3) Where, for the purposes of these Guidelines, any amount is determined on the basis of specified information, the most current information must be used.

...

## Presumptive rule

3. (1) Unless otherwise provided under these Guidelines, the amount of a child support order for children under the age of majority is
2. ( a ) the amount set out in the applicable table, according to the number of children under the age of majority to whom the order relates and the income of the spouse against whom the order is sought; and
3. ( b ) the amount, if any, determined under section 7.

. . .

## Incomes over $150,000

4. Where the income of the spouse against whom a child support order is sought is over $150,000, the amount of a child support order is
2. ( a ) the amount determined under section 3; or
3. ( b ) if the court considers that amount to be inappropriate,
4. (i) in respect of the first $150,000 of the spouse's income, the amount set out in the applicable table for the number of children under the age of majority to whom the order relates;
5. (ii) in respect of the balance of the spouse's income, the amount that the court considers appropriate, having regard to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children who are entitled to support and the financial ability of each spouse to contribute to the support of the children; and
6. (iii) the amount, if any, determined under section 7.

## Calculation of annual income

16. Subject to sections 17 to 20, a spouse's annual income is determined using the sources of income set out under the heading 'Total income' in the T1 General form issued by the Canada Revenue Agency and is adjusted in accordance with Schedule III.

## Pattern of income

17. (1) If  the court is of the opinion that the determination of a spouse's annual income under section 16 would not be the fairest determination of that income, the court may have regard to the spouse's income over the last three years and determine an amount that is fair and reasonable in light of any pattern of income, fluctuation in income or receipt of a non-recurring amount during those years.

## Non-recurring losses

- (2) Where a spouse has incurred a non-recurring capital or business investment loss, the court may, if it is of the opinion that the determination of the spouse's annual income under section 16 would not provide the fairest determination of the annual income, choose not to apply sections 6 and 7 of Schedule III,  and adjust the amount of the loss, including related expenses and carrying charges and interest expenses, to arrive at such amount as the court considers appropriate.
- [166] Section 18 of the Guidelines permits the court to determine a spouse's annual income to be all or part of the pre-tax income of a corporation, or in the alternative, to make a determination of that amount  commensurate  with the services that the spouse provided to the corporation.
- [167] If  a payer's income fluctuates,  is unpredictable  or if the estimate is unreliable, then  the usual  approach is to average income in accordance with section 17:  see Cornelissen v. Cornelissen, 2003 BCCA 666; M.H.G. v. D.J.G. ,  2006 BCSC 214.
- [168] Income averaging has also been used to take into consideration income sources that  may fluctuate  or be 'non-recurring'.
- [169] In M.H.G. v. D.J.G. ,  the husband  earned approximately  $176,000 in 2002, $450,000 in 2003 and $1.42 million in 2004. Given the fluctuating  nature  of his income, Russell  J. ordered child support based on an average of his 2002 - 2004 earnings. The husband  had argued that half of his 2004 income was attributable to a 'once in a career' project and should be excluded.  Russell  J. rejected this argument, noting that the nature  of his business was such that he would have fortuitous  results in some years and not in others (at para. 31).

[170] Smith J., in C.A.B. v. M.S.C.S. , 2006 BCSC 1393, used an average calculation  in response to a father's submission that his past earnings included 'nonrecurring'  amounts.  He lost his job in 2004, but received severance  and accelerated deferred payments  resulting  in total income of close to $3 million over several years. Smith J. also refused to use the husband's estimated current  income, which,  in his view, would deprive the children of any benefit of their father's  severance package, stating:

- [11] However, it would be equally unrealistic to consider only the current year, which would deprive the children of any benefit of their father's severance package. One of the objectives of the Guidelines , stated in s.1, is to provide children with a fair standard of support that ensures they continue to benefit from the financial means of both parents. It is important that the reference in s. 1 is to the parents' "means" because a party's means include more than income. The Supreme Court of Canada stated in Leskun v. Leskun , 2006 SCC 25 at ¶ 29 that the word "means" includes all pecuniary resources. In that context, the severance package should be seen for what it is-an amount that can be used to soften the blow of the changing circumstances by supplementing income through a reasonable period of transition. In fact, Mr. S. has prudently used some of the money to pay off the mortgage on his home, thereby reducing his expenses.
- [12] Rather than using an average based on the past, it would be more appropriate in this case to use "forward averaging" and spread the severance income over subsequent years. In my view, there is nothing in s. 17(1) of the Guidelines that would prevent such an approach. The section says the court "may have regard" to income over the last three years. It does not mandate any particular way to apply that information. The overriding concern is one of fairness. Even if I am wrong in my interpretation of s. 17, s. 19 allows the court to impute income as it considers appropriate. Although s. 19 lists a number of specific considerations, it is clear that is not intended to be an exhaustive list. In the circumstances of this case, it would be appropriate to use the severance package, or portions of it, to impute current and future income.
- [171] The recent decision of the Court of Appeal, Ouellette v. Ouellette , 2012 BCCA 145, is also illustrative  of this approach:
- [66] Section 19 gives the court a broad discretion to impute income, and is not subject to the restrictions set out in ss. 16, 17 and 18. Although the judge did not expressly state that he was imputing income to Mr. Ouellette in using the five-year average, it is my view that he was exercising the broad discretion under s. 19. The section contains a list of circumstances in which it would be appropriate to impute income, but the list is not exhaustive: see Riel v. Holland (2003), 232 D.L.R. (4th) 264, 67 O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.) at para. 36. Examples of situations where the court has imputed income on the basis of

an average income over a period longer than three years can be found in Nielsen v. Nielsen , 2007 BCCA 604, 75 B.C.L.R. (4th) 81 at paras. 44 to 46, and Gagne v. Gagne , 2011 ONCA 188, 99 R.F.L. (6th) 1 at paras. 11 and 12.

[67] In my opinion, the judge did not err in finding it appropriate in the circumstances to use a five-year average of the Partnership's earnings in determining the amount of income to be attributed to Mr. Ouellette for support purposes. Mr. Ouellette testified that the two years prior to the trial had been financially hard for the business as a result of the economic downturn in 2009, and a three-year average would not have accurately reflected the potential earning capacity of Mr. Ouellette. In addition, the parties separated approximately three years prior to the trial, and Mr. Ouellette may have manipulated the revenues and expenses of the business during this period in order to minimize the amount available to him for support purposes. A fiveyear average was more representative.

## [172] In  so far as s. 4 of the Guidelines is concerned:

-  there  must  be  'clear  and  compelling'  evidence  for  the  court  to  conclude  the table amount  is 'inappropriate';
-  a  wealthy  parent  faces  a  'formidable  onus'  in  establishing  that  the  table amount is inappropriate;
-  the  burden  is  on  a  wealthy  payor  to  establish  the  table  amount  could  not  be useful  to  the  children  having  regard  to  the  standard  of  living of other children of  very  wealthy parents. The needs of the children of very wealthy parents are different from those of 'ordinary  middle-class families';
-  while  the  Guidelines  provide  amounts  for  children  of  wealthy  parents  which others may consider extravagant, it is for the payor to prove the children could not  reasonably  use  the  extra  funds  and  the  other  parent  should  not  receive them.

Hollenbach v. Hollenbach , 2000 BCCA 620 at paras. 34-47.

## B. The Evidence Regarding the Respondent's Income

[173] A summary of the respondent's income is set out in the claimant's written submissions as follows:

|                            | 2006    | 2007    | 2008      | 2009   | 2010    | 2011       |
|----------------------------|---------|---------|-----------|--------|---------|------------|
| Employment income          | 626,660 | 353,972 | 3,406,361 | 90,000 | 60,000  | 533,600    |
| Taxable dividends          |         |         | 2,717     | 192    | 298,151 | 2,451,116  |
| Interest/investment income | 148     | 317     | 436       | 7,557  | 3,464   | 5,668      |
| Rental income              |         | -3,142  |           |        |         |            |
| Taxable capital gains      | 1,661   | 78,360  | 19,412    |        | 779     | 110,739    |
| Business income            |         |         |           |        |         |            |
| Other income               | 105,504 |         | 200,000   |        |         |            |
| Total                      | 733,973 | 429,507 | 3,628,926 | 97,749 | 362,394 | $3,101,123 |

[174] The claimant's position includes the following:

-  2009 was not a representative  year since this was a period of transition for the respondent from L. Copper to L. Capital;
-  the respondent has sources of income that are not indicated in his tax returns. He received millions of dollars in capital dividends from L. Capital representing the 50% of capital gains earned by L. Capital that are not taxable.  In addition, only  50% of his personal capital gains are declared for tax purposes;
-  the respondent receives $49,000 per month,  or $588,000 per year, as management fees. This represents a stable source of income;
-  taxable dividends flow to the respondent from L. Capital to L. Asset Management Corp. to A. Investments  and then through  to the Family Trust. These represent the taxable portion of the capital gain earnings by L. Capital as a result of 'profitability events'.  In  2010, taxable dividends were approximately  $478,000. In  2011, they  were approximately  $2.1 million;
-  the respondent has also received non-taxable  capital dividends. In 2010, these amounted to approximately  $275,000. In  2011, they  were $2.1 million;
-  there will be other opportunities to earn income through  predictability or 'liquidity events';
-  the respondent's consulting  income is earned through  H. Consulting. Revenues  generated through  this source from 2009 to 2012 inclusive  were:

|   2009 | $463,940   |
|--------|------------|
|   2010 | $345,000   |
|   2011 | $201,097   |
|   2012 | $661,640   |

-  it is common in the junior mining industry  for management  to accept lower salaries but with an incentive  to participate in the future  success of a particular company  through  share options. In  2008, the respondent  received $1.45 million and $1.954 million as a result  of the exercise of share options. In 2011, he received approximately  $450,000;
-  the value of the share options which  the parties agree are to be apportioned 50% each have a current  potential value  in excess of $2 million;
-  the respondent will receive a $100,000 bonus for 2012 from L. Capital;
-  the respondent has also been successful  in making personal investments.  In 2007 he generated approximately  $157,000 in capital gains. In  2011 the amount was $221,500. In  addition, he had traded stocks through  a brokerage account  in the name of A. Investments.

[175] Expert evidence was led with respect to the respondent's Guideline  income. It was calculated on a three-year  average and includes L. Royalty  stock option income, but excludes  the L. Copper stock option income, which the parties agree will be apportioned equally.  The calculations  as set out in the claimant's written submissions are as follows:

L.H.'s 3-Year Average with L.R. income

|               | 2009    | 2010      | 2011      | 3-year ave.   |
|---------------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Income        | 440,000 | 2,370,000 | 4,570,000 | 2,460,000     |
| Child support | $4,588  | $23,695   | $57,796   | $31,210       |

L.H.'s 3-Year Average excluding L.R. income

|               | 2009    | 2010      | 2011      | 3-year ave.   |
|---------------|---------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Income        | 440,000 | 2,370,000 | 4,080,000 | 2,296,666     |
| Child support | $4,588  | $23,695   | $51,622   | $29,152       |

[176] The claimant's position is summarized  as follows:

The reality is that Mr. H, who is only 43 years old, has the ability to earn substantial income from a number of sources, some of which have the potential to provide spectacular returns in some years.

- [177] The claimant submits that a three-year  average income of $2.296 million is a fair representation of the respondent's income earning ability.
- [178] The claimant's position is that her Guideline income is $22,000 per year. This is not challenged  by the respondent,  although  he does submit this will have to be reviewed when the claimant receives income anticipated to be at least $1 million,  if not more, when  the L. Copper share options are exercised.
- [179] Accordingly,  the claimant submits that  indefinite spousal support based on the 'with child formula'  in the Spousal Support Guidelines would result  in a range of approximately  $54,000-$63,000 per month.  She seeks monthly  support at the low end of the range, namely  $54,121, taxable to her and tax deductible and retroactive to a date the court views as being appropriate.
- [180] She also seeks child support in the amount  of approximately  $29,000 per month retroactive to January  1, 2012.
- [181] The respondent's position is that with the addition of pre-tax corporate income the total income available to him was:
- [182] He relies on section 2(3) of the Guidelines  which state that '[w]here,  for the purposes of these Guidelines, any amount  is determined on the basis of specified information,  the most current  information  must be used'.
- [183] It  is the respondent's position that based on his evidence and that of L. Group's chief financial officer who testified at trial, his 2012 income will be $688,000 including  a $100,000 bonus.  The evidence was also to the effect that no stock options have been or will be exercised in 2012 and there will be no distribution of funds from the L. Group to the respondent's corporate entities in that year. This was due to the fact there were no 'liquidity events'  that year.

2009: $440,000

2010: $2.37 million

2011: $4.57 million

[184] The respondent  also submits that the significant income earned in 2010 and 2011 was in large part comprised of two anomalies or 'windfalls',  being liquidity events  that materialized in those years.

[185] The respondent  argues that the claimant's position that income for support purposes should  be based on a three-year  average of $2.46 million is flawed because:

-  it ignores section 2(3) of the Guidelines,  which mandates the use of the most current  information;
-  it ignores section 17(1) of the Guidelines in respect of the consideration of non-recurring  income. He points to the two 'windfalls'  which occurred in 2010 and 2011;
-  the claimant's position does not take into account the concept of 'double dipping', which the respondent alleges occurs when  income received by the family is included in the valuation  of the family assets which both spouses will share in accordance with the provisions of Part 5 of the Family Relations Act .
- [186] The respondent  argues that based on his 2012 income of $688,000, he should  pay child support of $9,000 per month,  including  his share of section 7 expenses, and $16,000 per month  in spousal support, for a total of $25,000 per month.  This is effectively  what he has been paying since July  2011.
- [187] The respondent  emphasizes his proposal for spousal support does not include a consideration of the claimant's income from assets she will receive or retain as a result  of the division of family assets. The claimant's income must also take into account the $500 per month  she receives from government  sources on account  of B's autism treatments  and tax credits in respect of both children.
- [188] The respondent's position is that spousal support should  be paid indefinitely, subject to a variation based on a material change of circumstances,  which  must specifically address the stock option income in excess of $1 million to be received in due course.
- [189] The claimant's response to the respondent's  position is that he maintains a lifestyle  which is incompatible with an annual  income of $688,000. She points to the

respondent's financial statement  expenses of $826,000 and submits he needs to earn $826,000 in after-tax  dollars to support his listed expenses. That  would equate to a pre-tax income of $1.467 million.

## C. Discussion Regarding Income for Support Purposes

[190] I  am of the view that both the claimant's and the respondent's  positions as to the respondent's Guideline income of approximately  $2.3 million on the one hand and $688,000 on the other are unrealistic and inappropriate.

[191] I  have reached this conclusion  for the following reasons:

-  the income available to the respondent in 2010 and 2011 included certain 'windfalls'  or 'liquidity events'.  Both parties have benefited significantly  from these funds in that they  were used to reduce liabilities on the West 5th Avenue property, make extensive  renovations  to that property and to the Whistler property,  and to acquire the West 3rd Avenue  property;
-  the parties and the children  also benefited from these funds.  This is demonstrated by their privileged lifestyle;
-  there was insufficient  evidence from which I could conclude that  windfalls in relation to future  liquidity events  would be in the range of those that occurred in 2010 and 2011. It would be unfair  to determine the respondent's guideline income for prospective support based on what occurred in those years, although  I accept that  one of the principal reasons for L. Capital's existence is to identify certain projects which it is hoped will lead to future  liquidity events;
-  it would  be equally  unfair  to determine the respondent's Guideline income on the basis of what  occurred in 2012. Although  income of $688,000 (which includes a $100,000 bonus) is the 'most current  information',  there is a body of evidence from which I can conclude  that the respondent's income fluctuates  greatly from year to year. The 2012 income is at the low end of the range, although  I do recognize it was $440,000 in 2009. In  2012, for example, there were no share options exercised nor were there any liquidity events;
-  it is also clear the respondent  has sources of income and revenue  in addition to those generated by his management  and professional services.

[192] Under the circumstances and considering all of the evidence on this issue and the legal principles to which I referred, I have concluded  that the respondent's annual  Guideline income for support purposes as of January  1, 2013, should be

$1 million.  I accept the claimant's submission that her income for support purposes is $22,000. I find that both spousal and child support commencing January  1, 2013, should  be based on the mid range of the Table amount for a minimum of one year, being the 2013 calendar year. The calculation  is to take into account  the funds received by the claimant to which I have referred in paragraph 187 above. This will include section 7 expenses.

[193] The parties will also exchange  the required financial documents  on an annual basis as set out below. If,  following  the exchange of this information,  they are unable to agree as to the amount  of child and spousal support for 2014 and successive years, they  have leave to apply to have that determined. Child and spousal support for 2014 and successive years shall be based on the mid-range of the Guidelines table amount  and shall  continue indefinitely,  subject only  to an application by either party pursuant  to s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act .

[194] The statutory  provisions and case authorities which outline  the basis for an award of compensatory  and non-compensatory  spousal support are summarized  in some detail in Chutter v. Chutter at paras. 45-61.

[195] I  do not consider that reapportionment  of the family  assets as described above and an award of permanent  spousal support based on both compensatory and non-compensatory  grounds amounts  to 'double recovery'  or 'double dipping'. This is not a case that falls into the 'potential pitfall' of double recovery:   see Toth v. Toth at para. 59.

- [196] The reapportionment  of the family assets was designed to provide the claimant with a fair proportion of the assets, taking into account her contribution  to their acquisition. This included giving up her career and fulfilling  the homemaker role, which both she and the respondent believed to have been in the best interests of the H. family unit.  The division of assets likely represents the only  occasion for the claimant to obtain assets in keeping with the standard of living to which she had become accustomed and which had been accumulated in considerable part through her efforts.

[197] With the exception of the stock options to be exercised, there is no real 'income' that will be generated by the reapportionment  of the assets in question. It should  also be noted that when  those stock options are exercised, the respondent will receive an equal amount.

- [198] In  my view there is no 'double recovery'  since the amount  of spousal support will provide a future  stream of income to the claimant which  recognizes the reality of the situation she finds herself  at this stage of her life. In  other words, a woman:
2.  who is 42 years old;
3.  has been absent from the workforce for many  years;
4.  has university  training and work experience which  is likely not suited to obtaining employment  in those fields in the future.
- [199] These factors should  be considered within the context  of her ongoing parental obligations to her young  children  all of which  will likely result  in an inability to be selfsupporting in the future.
- [200] Viewed within these parameters, indefinite spousal support  calculated in the manner set out above serves a different  purpose than reapportionment.  It will enable the claimant to benefit from and maintain the assets and standard of living I have concluded she is entitled to receive.

## D. Retroactive Child Support

[201] In D.B.S. v. S.R.G. ,  2006 SCC 37, the principles governing  retroactive support were set out. The following  is an accurate  summary  of these principles provided in the claimant's submissions:

- (a) Child support is the right of the child;
- (b) Child support, should, as much as possible provide children with the same standard of living they enjoyed when their parents were together;
- (c) An underlying principal of the guidelines is that the support obligation should fluctuate with the payor parent's income. Parents have an

obligation to support their children commensurate with their income. This obligation exists independent of any statute or court order;

- (d) A payor parent who does not increase child support payments to correspond with income will not have fulfilled their obligation to the children;
- (e) There is no obligation on a parent to automatically disclose changes to income, but if income rises and the amount of child support paid does not also rise, their remains an unfulfilled  obligation that the court could enforce;
- (f) A child always has the right to receive child support in an amount that is commensurate with the payor's income;
- (g) If there is an existing child support order, the obligation of the payor parent, while presumed to be the amount ordered by court, will not necessarily be frozen to the amount ordered;
- (h) Retroactive award should not be seen as exceptional;
- (i) The court should consider the circumstances surrounding any delay in applying, the payor parents conduct, the child's circumstances and any hardship caused by a retroactive award;
- (j) The court must consider if there is a reasonable excuse for failure to seek support earlier. Delay is not presumptively justifiable but the court can consider such circumstances as the recipient fearing that the payor would react vindictively to the application or the recipient parent lacked the financial or emotional means to bring an application or the recipient parent received inadequate legal advice. Justice Abella stated in the minority that if a delay is caused by not been informed about a change in income, the delay should not affect the child support award;
- (k) Blameworthy conduct by the payor parent is anything that privileges the payor parents own interests over the child's right to an appropriate amount of support. No level of blameworthy behaviour by payor parents should be encouraged. Even where a payor parent does nothing active to avoid his/her obligation, he or she might still be acting in a blameworthy manner if they consciously choose to ignore them. A payor parent who knowingly avoids or diminishes his/her support obligation to his/her children should not be allowed to profit from such conduct. On the other hand, a payor who fails to increase support payments automatically is not necessarily engaging in blameworthy conduct;
- (l) The date for the retroactive award should generally be the date in which the payor received effective notice. All that is require is that the topic of child support be broached, which means that any indication by the recipient parent that child support should be paid or that the current amount of child support needs to be re-negotiated;
- (m) The date of effective notice may not be appropriate in some cases, such as where there has been some blameworthy conduct such as the withholding of information. In those circumstances, the date when

increased support should have been paid will be a more appropriate date. A payor parent cannot use his/her informational advantage to justify his/her deficient child support payments.

- (n) It will be inappropriate to order retroactive child support more than three years before formal notice was given to the payor parent.

[202] The claimant seeks retroactive  child support for the period from January  1, 2012 to October 1, 2012. In  her written  submissions she argues the child support payable should  have been $21,152 per month  less the $8,000 per month paid. This would result  in arrears of $211,520 calculated as follows:

| 2012   | Guideline income                | $2,296,666   |
|--------|---------------------------------|--------------|
|        | Child support payable per month | $29,152.00   |
|        | Less child support paid         | ($8,000)     |
|        | Difference                      | $21,152.00   |
|        | Arrears ($21,152 x 10 months)   | $211,520.00  |

[203] In  support of her position the claimant says:

-  the respondent engaged in blameworthy  conduct  in 2011 when he misled the claimant and the court by failing to disclose the significant increase in his income during that year. In  particular,  his Form 8 Financial Statement  sworn July  18, 2011, listed his income as $661,000;
-  the respondent's 2011 taxable income was in fact $3.1 million. His actual income as calculated  by the expert was $4.57 million.  In cross-examination, the respondent confirmed he had the benefit of $4.197 million that year;
-  the respondent failed to comply with Rule 5-1(15) of the Supreme Court Family Rules ,  which  requires a party to file and serve an updated financial statement  if existing information  is inaccurate or incomplete. It was not until September 10, 2012, that an updated financial statement  was sworn;
-  the claimant testified that  the respondent  never informed her directly what his 2011 income was. Nor did he indicate it was different from past years' income;
-  due to the respondent's lack of disclosure, the claimant was denied the opportunity  to seek a fair amount  of child support with the result  'they  were denied what they were entitled to';
-  the claimant reduced her lifestyle as a result  of the separation in order to live within the $18,000 per month  payments  she received. She was no longer able to shop at Whole Foods or purchase organic food as she had in the past. In

addition, she was obliged to cut back on food, entertainment  and vacations. In so far as the children were concerned,  she was not able to be as generous with toys and books for them as she had in the past;

-  the claimant testified as to a number  of expenses she was unable to pay but which would  have to be addressed in the future.  These included  repairs to her vehicle,  expenses for the children including  orthodontic treatment  and laptops, RESP's, and repairs and maintenance  to the West 5th Avenue property;
-  the children's lifestyle  has declined following  the separation and they have  the need for and are entitled to retroactive support;
-  the respondent had the ability to pay higher child support throughout  the period of separation. This is shown  by his lifestyle  and level of personal discretionary spending. Given his financial circumstances,  he will not sustain any hardship by reason of a retroactive award.

[204] The respondent  opposes any retroactive child support.  His reasons include:

-  the parties and the children  received the benefits of his income in 2009, 2010 and 2011;
-  the family's lavish lifestyle  is shown by the various  bank and credit card statements,  the payment  of the mortgage on the West 5th Avenue  property in the amount  of $1.62 million together with approximately  $1 million for the renovations  of the West 5th Avenue  and Whistler properties and the payment of $1.194 million on the West 5th Avenue property which  is an agreed family asset;
-  the income used to fund the joint account used almost exclusively  by the claimant was approximately  $1,000,000;
-  the claimant received $18,000 tax-free  support for herself and the children. This equates to $25,000 per month  pre-tax;
-  $20,000 was deposited to the Whistler property account;
-  these amounts do not include  payment of the claimant's charges on her Visa and American Express credit cards, which she used between January  and July  2011.

[205] When I take into account  the applicable legal principles and the evidence relating to this issue which forms the basis of the parties' respective submissions, I

am of the view it would not be appropriate to order retroactive  child support in this case. My reasons include:

-  I  do not consider there to have been blameworthy  conduct on the respondent's part. This is not a case where a party deliberately failed to disclose relevant  financial information and then benefitted from his or her misconduct;
-  I  referred earlier in these reasons for judgment  to the considerable income and other sources of revenue  received by the respondent and how they  were used. The H. family unit  as a whole,  including  the children,  have benefited from these funds;
-  had the respondent voluntarily  or pursuant  to a court  order paid child support in a greater amount  than  was in fact paid, this would  likely have reduced other payments made for the family's benefit;
-  the claimant's evidence as to her and the children's reduced lifestyle  must be placed in the proper context.  A review of the amounts  spent on the children's behalf and their physical surroundings  when  they were at the West 5th Avenue property, Whistler  or on vacations does not, in my view, provide the necessary basis for an entitlement  to retroactive support.

## E. Retroactive Spousal Support

[206] The legal principles which apply are accurately  summarized  in paragraph 393 of the claimant's written  submissions:

## Retroactive Spousal Support

1. In Yemchuk v. Yemchuk , 2005 BCCA 406 at para. 74, the Court of Appeal confirmed that the factors relevant to retroactive spousal support are the same as the factors for retroactive child support as stated in L.S. v. E.P. , 1999 BCCA 393 namely:

Factors in favour of ordering retroactive maintenance include:

- (1) the need on the part of the spouse and a corresponding ability to pay on the part of the other spouse;
- (2) some blameworthy conduct on the part of the payor spouse such as incomplete or misleading financial disclosure at the time of the original order;
- (3) necessity on the part of the recipient spouse to encroach on his or her capital or to incur debt to meet expenses;
- (4) an excuse for a delay in bringing the application where the delay is significant; and

- (5) notice to the payor spouse of an intention to pursue maintenance followed by negotiations to that end.

Factors against ordering retroactive maintenance include:

- (1) an unreasonable or unfair burden to the payor spouse, especially to the extent that such a burden would interfere with ongoing support obligations;
- (2) the only purpose of the award would be to redistribute capital; and
- (3) a significant, unexplained delay in bringing the application.

[207] As was the case with retroactive child support,  I have concluded this claim should  be dismissed.

[208] I  do not do so on the basis of one of the respondent's submissions. This was to the effect that in her opening statement  the claimant sought only  prospective spousal support and yet at the conclusion  of the trial, claimed retroactive support for 2012.

[209] Rather,  I do so for the same reasons I outlined  in dismissing the claim for retroactive child support. I would add that in the circumstances  of this case, it would be unreasonable  or unfair  for the respondent to pay the retroactive spousal support claimed when one considers the funds  spent for the parties' benefit and the lifestyle they  have both been able to maintain.

[210] It  is also difficult to understand  the claimant's assertions she has been living a significantly  reduced lifestyle.  She appears to have sufficient  funds to subsidize, to some extent,  M.J.'s lifestyle,  notwithstanding  his assertion that he pays his own expenses. Although  the claimant denied she and M.J. were living together, he clearly  spends considerable periods of time at the West 5th Avenue property.  The claimant also paid for part of M.J.'s European vacation which they  took together.

## VIII MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS

- [211] I  also make the following  orders:
2. (a)  neither  party will remove the children  from the Province of British Columbia without  the consent in writing of the other party  or court order, such consent  not to be unreasonably  withheld;
3. (b)  each party will each provide the other by June  15th in each year in which the obligation to pay child support continues  with:
4. (i)  a photocopy  of their most recent income tax return,  inclusive of all tax information  slips and schedules;
5. (ii)  the notice of assessment,  when received;
6. (iii)  the most recent annual  statement of earnings,  including overtime;
7. (iv)  any other relevant  information to facilitate determination  of the adjustment,  if any,  required to the child support;
8. (c)  the respondent  shall provide the claimant with the following  when available to him but no later than  July  31st in each year:
9. (i)  the financial statements  and tax returns  of A. Investments Ltd.;
10. (ii)  the financial  statements and tax returns  of H. Consulting Ltd.;
11. (iii)  the financial statements  and tax returns  of L. Asset Management Inc.;
12. (iv)  the financial statements  and tax returns  of any other company in which  the respondent  has more than  a 5% interest, and

- (v)  any other relevant  corporate, partnership or trust financial information  to facilitate determination of the adjustment,  if any, required to the child support.

[212] In  light of my conclusion  that the parenting schedule  I have ordered should remain in effect for at least two years, I will seize myself  of any  applications relating to this proceeding for a period of three years from these reasons for judgment.

- [213] The parties have liberty to address the matter of costs.
