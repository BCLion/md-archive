## INTRODUCTION

- [1] This is a high-conflict  family law dispute. The issues to be determined include entitlement  to divorce, parenting arrangements  for the five children of the marriage, as well as child and spousal support. Each issue will be addressed separately.

## FACTUAL BACKGROUND

- [2] The following  chronology  of various events  sets out findings of fact based on the evidence and relates to matters that  are largely  uncontroversial.  In  other parts of the judgment  where facts significant to any issue are in dispute, the evidence tendered by the parties may be cited and express findings of fact will be made.
- [3] G.G. (also 'the father')  was born November 12, 1961, in Detroit, Michigan, and is currently  53 years old. He attended the University  of Maryland  where he obtained a Bachelor of Science degree, specializing in accounting  and finance, followed by a Master's of Business Administration (MBA). Following university,  he worked in the banking industry  for approximately  six years before joining Riverdale International  Inc.,  a commercial property developer  headquartered in Washington, DC. He also undertook real estate development  under his own personal business corporation, Dexter International  LLC. For the past several years, however,  he has been effectively  unemployed  and has had no income.
- [4] N.G. (also 'the  mother') was born on September 20, 1964, in Vancouver, BC, and is currently  51 years old. She graduated with a medical degree from the University  of British Columbia in 1991, thereafter  completing an internship  and residency at Dalhousie University  for a specialty as a general surgeon.  She then completed a number of fellowships  in Montréal,  Washington,  DC, Chicago and Houston  to become a certified pediatric surgeon and has been practising as such in Victoria, BC, since 2005.
- [5] The couple met in 1998 and were married on October 31, 1998, in a Catholic church  wedding. Another  marriage ceremony  was also performed in Hawaii in December 1998.

- [6] The couple have five female children namely:
1. S., born August 5, 2001, in Washington,  DC, currently  13 years old;
2. T., born June 26, 2003, in Houston,  currently  11 years old;
4. 3 Ao., born January  16, 2006, in Victoria, BC, currently  nine years old; and
4. The twins, Ai. and N., born August 26, 2009, in Victoria, BC, currently five years old.
- [7] The couple/family  resided in Washington,  DC, for the period 1998 to 2002, and thereafter  in Chicago, Illinois,  for one year, and Houston,  Texas,  for the period 2003 to 2005. These moves were to accommodate N.G.'s various fellowships  in pediatric surgical critical care.
- [8] In  September 2005, the family moved to Victoria, BC, where they continue to reside, albeit now in separate households.  Throughout  this period of time, G.G.'s employment  was headquartered  in Washington,  DC, and he engaged in fairly extensive  travel  each year for business purposes.
- [9] Apart from his employment  as managing director of Riverdale  International Inc.  (and related entities), G.G. also built a fairly  substantial  property development portfolio over the years. He took leveraged advantage of US tax exemptions for capital gains on personal residences, combined with the single-purpose  LLC structure  of Dexter International  which allowed for contributions  and withdrawals without  tax consequences.  Property would be purchased in the name of both N.G. and G.G., loans taken out secured by the property value,  development/ improvements undertaken  and, following  appreciation in value,  resale or repositioning as rental properties would then  occur. The leveraged nature  of the portfolio permitted the couple to enjoy  a wealthy  lifestyle  but in the years following  the 2008 financial  crash, the substantial  equity  in the portfolio nosedived

into substantial  deficits. Creditors closed in, loans were called, and the wealthy lifestyle  came to an end.

- [10] In  September 2005, the couple purchased  a substantial  home in the Upland's area of Victoria. G.G. obtained his flying licence and in 2007 he purchased a sixpassenger Cessna turboprop aircraft through  a holding company,  Zazu  Holdings LLC. The aircraft was refinanced in February 2008, giving rise to a debt obligation, including  finance charges, of approximately  $850,000.
- [11] The house in Victoria, which  had been purchased for approximately $4.5 million in 2005, saw its value  increase over the years to almost $10 million. The property was also refinanced in order to extract equity and was subject  to two mortgages of approximately  $7 million. Following  the crash of the couple's portfolio, payments on the house could not be made and foreclosure  proceedings were instituted.  The property was eventually  sold in foreclosure  in March 2012 for approximately  $4 million,  leaving a substantial  shortfall  in the mortgage security and considerable personal liability.
- [12] The couple also purchased  a condominium  in Sun Peaks Resort, again through  a holding company  owned by the family.  That property  was also leveraged and, following its eventual  sale, substantial  debt to the two mortgagees remained.
- [13] In  the meantime,  all of the children were enrolled  in Montessori day schools and thereafter  in the private (and costly) Glenlyon  Norfolk School (GNS) in Victoria. All of the children are still attending  GNS, although  the parents are now unable  to afford the tuition.  That tuition has been funded for some time by N.G.'s parents.
- [14] Sailing has always been a common interest of both parents. The family members are all members of the Victoria Yacht  Club. The two eldest children  have been enrolled in various sailing programs throughout  the years which have entailed substantial  travel  locally,  nationally  and internationally.  Sailing has been and remains a time-consuming  and expensive undertaking  which the couple can no longer realistically  afford.

- [15] The International  Baccalaureate Program at GNS requires extensive participation in co-curricular,  non-academic activities including  a variety  of sports, drama and social service ventures.  Quite apart from GNS-related activities, all of the children  are also enrolled in a variety of other programs including  soccer, ballet and the sailing referred to above. The logistics for all of these children's activities are very  challenging  and involve  conflicts that would be daunting,  even for a happily married couple with a healthy  support network,  let alone for a couple who are separated and have been engaging in intensive,  high-conflict  family law litigation for almost two and one-half  years.
- [16] While the dissolution of the couple's relationship is no doubt related to the two parents' conflicting  styles and personalities and exacerbated by the total collapse of their leveraged lifestyle,  matters started coming to a head in 2011 and have been in a downward spiral since that date.
- [17] In  March 2011, the Child Protection Services Division of the Ministry  of Children and Family Development  ('Ministry')  received a report from the school of shouting,  name-calling  and possibly excessive physical discipline in the G. household.  One outcome of this report was the enrolment  of the couple in marriage counselling  for the next  several months.  That  counselling,  which lasted for several months,  was unsuccessful.  Garnishing  orders were issued by creditors on the couple's bank accounts  and the mother's RRSP. The mother terminated the father's employment:  he had been working for some time as her office assistant and with the development  of her electronic medical records system.  The house was subject to an order nisi of foreclosure  but no purchasers  could be found.
- [18] In  early November 2011, the husband  consulted  with the family solicitor and inquired about separation and divorce.
- [19] During the summer  of 2012, the husband travelled  extensively  with S. and T. for a variety  of sailing events in both Canada and the USA.

[20] In  August 2012, the husband  emailed the wife demanding a divorce. Lawyers were retained. A collaborative process for divorce was proposed.

[21] On January  9, 2013, an altercation occurred between the parents at the home. The Saanich police attended upon being summoned by the father. The  father had the twins in his bedroom and the mother was attempting access when some grabbing and pushing ensued.  Things had settled down by the time the police arrived, however  the incident was reported to the Ministry by the police.

[22] On January  18, 2013, while the father was away in the United States, the mother moved the children  and all her belongings to another  rental home. She did not advise the father  of this beforehand and he returned  from his trip to find the house empty and his children  gone. He became extremely  distressed and reported the matter to both the police and to the Ministry.

[23] On January  19, 2013, the twins were attending a junior kindergarten orientation at GNS. The mother and T. were also present. The father came into the room, lifted N. into his arms and took her away. His counsel calls it 'taking N. into his care.' The mother  considers it to be abduction.

[24] On January  21, 2013, the husband  made an ex parte application in the Victoria location of the Provincial Court and secured an order granting joint custody and joint guardianship to both parents of the five children.  The order also provided for an adjournment  of further  proceedings to January  24, 2013. At this later date the wife attended with counsel and an order was granted requiring the husband to return N. to the mother by way of pickup at the Montessori school at 5:00 p.m. that  same day. The order also required all of the children's passports to be surrendered, prohibited the removal  of the children  from Vancouver  Island,  and adjourned  to January  31, 2013 the issue of appropriate access.

[25] On January  31, 2013, the Provincial Court issued a consent order granting the husband  specified access to the three youngest  children  from February  1 to

February  3, 2013. No access was ordered for S. and T. as there was no agreement between the parties on that  issue.

[26] In  March 2013, the parties attempted mediation without  success. The mediator issued an email to the parties noting that  the two 'divorce coaches' for the parents would continue  to work with their respective clients and would also try to identify an appropriate counsellor  for the children.  It was also noted that the husband was 'taking a break' from seeing the children  for the next couple weeks while his divorce coach was away.

[27] On April 3, 2013, the husband  attended GNS and removed T. from class to take her to an appointment  that he had made with the family doctor. She did not wish to go but the school granted permission. At the doctor's office, T. initially refused to get out of the car. Eventually  she went into the office and was interviewed by Dr. Nielson. The father  was asked to leave and the mother  was summoned  to retrieve T.

[28] On April 11, 2013, the Provincial Court issued an order prohibiting the father's attendance  at GNS and the Montessori school being attended by the twins.  The order also prohibited the parties from attending at the other's places of residence, employment,  education or recreation.

[29] On April 22, 2013, the father  attended the Yacht  Club while the eldest children  were present. Another confrontation  ensued and the police were called. The father was asked to leave the premises.

[30] The present Supreme Court proceedings were initiated by the mother  on May 17, 2013. In  her Notice of Family Claim, the mother sought  a divorce, primary custody  of all five children,  parenting time with the father for only  the three youngest children,  child support and a variety of conduct  orders restraining  the father's communication and contact with both the mother and the children.

[31] The father filed his Response and Counterclaim  on June 18, 2013. He too sought  a divorce and parenting time with the children,  together with  both child and spousal support.

[32] Since the institution  of the Supreme Court proceedings, there have been no less than  15 orders made by seven  different members of this Court. The first order, dated July 16, 2013, directed the preparation of a report pursuant  to s. 211 of the Family Law Act , S.B.C. 2011, c. 25, assessing the needs of the children,  the ability and willingness  of the parents to satisfy those needs, and the views of each child, to be prepared by a psychologist  to be jointly  selected by the parents.  The parties eventually  agreed upon the selection of Dr. Peter Meuser for the s. 211 assessment and their respective lawyers  issued a joint letter of retainer to Dr. Meuser on September 11, 2013.

[33] On August 30, 2013, the wife made an assignment into bankruptcy.  She has still not been discharged. Her discharge has been opposed by one of the house mortgage creditors but it is anticipated that an application will be made shortly  for a discharge notwithstanding  the objection.

[34] Various orders were made during the period August 19, 2013 to April 2014 respecting parenting  arrangements,  travel  for the children,  and other contentious matters.

[35] Dr. Meuser issued his s. 211 report on April 8, 2014. He concluded  that the mother had been engaging in a program of systematic alienation of the children  from the father,  particularly  insofar as S. and T. were concerned. He made a number  of recommendations including that the parties and children be enrolled in a counselling program specifically designed to address alienation.

[36] On May 1, 2014, an order was issued implementing  counselling  with Alyson Jones &amp; Associates 'Family Forward Reunification  Therapy  Program' and directing the parents to follow  all reasonable treatment  recommendations  made by the therapists in that program. An order for parenting  time for the father with the three

youngest  children  was made, however  his parenting time with the two oldest children was suspended.

[37] In  June, Alyson  Jones recommended equal parenting  time between the parents and all of the children.  On July  4, 2014, this Court issued an order creating such an equal parenting time regime for the months  of July  and August.  The order also provided that the eldest daughter,  S., would be at liberty to attend a certain sailing competition in Lunenburg,  Nova Scotia, from August 10, 2014 to August 23, 2014.

[38] In  the third week of August 2014, the father  took the four other children to visit family in Michigan, USA. He attended Lunenburg  on August 22 to pick up S. to take her back to Detroit. This was the last day of the sailing event  in Lunenburg.  A confrontation  ensued with S. refusing  to leave that  particular evening.  The father retrieved her in the early morning of the following  day and the two of them travelled to Michigan.

[39] While in Michigan, in response to truculence  on the part of S., the father  is alleged to have violently  pushed her down some stairs. The father  vehemently denies this.

[40] On the return  trip to Vancouver,  in frustrated  response to further  verbal defiance and insults  by S. at the airport, the father  slapped S. in the face in front of the other children.

[41] Upon the family's return  to Victoria, the slapping and alleged pushing incidents were reported to both the police and the Ministry  and investigations were undertaken.  In  the course of that investigation,  T. disclosed to the Ministry  an incident which she said occurred four years earlier and involved  her father  dragging her out into the garage and putting her in a dog kennel.  This alleged incident features prominently  in the mother's various accusations of abuse by the father.

The father denies anything  of the sort occurred and says it is a complete fabrication.

The Ministry  ultimately  made a determination that the children  were not in need of protection.

- [42] In  September 2014, the two youngest  children, the twins,  started school at GNS. On September 4, 2014, the Court issued a further  order for parenting  time for both parents on a four-day  on, four-day  off basis.
- [43] In  September, the mother filed an application to terminate the counselling program with Alyson Jones. She also filed an application for an order to have Dr. Meuser's s. 211 report reviewed or alternatively  for a second such report to be prepared.
- [44] A two-day  hearing on all outstanding  applications occurred in front  of Mr. Justice Pearlman in October 2014. On October 28, 2014, the Court issued an order dismissing the mother's applications referred to above, confirming  shared parenting on a one-week on, one-week off basis and directing continuation  of counselling  with Alyson  Jones &amp; Associates. The order also directed the father  not to disrupt or interfere with the children's ballet, swimming, soccer and sailing activities, a direction which  the mother  alleges to have  been breached many  times since.
- [45] On January  13, 2015, N. sustained a scratch on her forearm. It apparently occurred when her father was hurrying  her to get dressed that day. The mother brought  the scratch to the attention  of the school principal and the matter was also reported to the Ministry.  Interviews  were again conducted.  The father was completely  unaware  that any scratch had been sustained.  The Ministry  did not suspect any type of child abuse and the incident was closed.
- [46] In  the fall of 2014, the attendance  of the mother and the two eldest children  at Alyson Jones counselling  petered off. In January  2015, the mother reconnected  with the Family Forward Therapy  Program and counselling  for the family resumed on February  2, 2015, and has continued  to date.
- [47] The trial of this action was held for 17 days April 20-24, 27-30, and; May 1, 6-8, 25-26, and 28-29, 2015.

## CASE MANAGEMENT AND SEIZURE OF FUTURE APPLICATIONS

[48] The term 'high  conflict' fails to properly capture the depth of animosity displayed by the parties in this case. To date, there have been countless applications by the parties resulting in 21 orders issued by 10 different judges in the Supreme and Provincial Courts. I am the 11th member of the judiciary to handle this matter and, unlike  my predecessors, I have  had the benefit of 17 days of evidence from 26 different witnesses.

[49] I  am in complete agreement with the comments  of Madam Justice Martinson in A.A. v. S.N.A. , 2009 BCSC 387, to the following effect:

77. It is imperative in high conflict family cases generally, and certainly in cases involving allegations of alienation like this one, that one member of the Court take charge of the case. Having a single judge hear cases is required by s. 14 of the Supreme Court Act :
- (1) All proceedings in the court and all business arising from those proceedings, if practicable and convenient, must be heard, determined and disposed of before a single judge.
- (2) All proceedings subsequent to the hearing or trial including the final order, except as otherwise provided, and on a rehearing must, if practicable and convenient, be before the judge before whom the trial or hearing took place.
78. The reasons for doing so for all cases are obvious. The judge will be familiar with the case so the litigants do not have to explain the situation over and over again. It avoids 'judge shopping' to try to get a better result. It prevents inconsistent approaches. It saves legal and other costs. There will be times in dealing with some cases when it is not convenient or practical to do so.
79. However, in high conflict custody cases the stakes are particularly high; children can be seriously harmed by the ongoing acrimony and lack of a timely resolution. It should be only in rare circumstances that the court finds it inconvenient or impractical to have a single judge hear the applications in cases of this sort.
80. It is common for these cases to come before the court numerous times before the trial takes place. The problems do not end with the trial judgment. After the trial, it is equally common to have one parent or both make repeated applications to the court, often trying to change the result at trial. Issues that have been decided at trial are re-argued. Highly contentious access problems arise. There are allegations of breaches of court orders. These problems can, if unchecked, go on for many months or even years. It is the trial judge who knows the situation; that judge, in my opinion, should

deal with the matter as it continues to unfold, as envisioned by s. 14 of the Supreme Court Act .

81. Unless a particular judge decides to become seized of a case, the applications can be heard by many different judges. I was the fifth judge to deal with this case after the Court of Appeal made its decision in June 2007. If a judge does become seized of a case, the applications normally must be dealt with on top of the judge's regular workload, before or after normal court hours. This ad hoc approach is not effective. It does not give these important cases, and the children involved in them, the attention they deserve.
82. In my respectful view, an institutional response is required which identifies these cases early and ensures that they are dealt with by one judge who has experience in and an interest in family law. The importance of effective case management in high conflict cases is supported by judges, legal academics, medical professionals, and lawyers.

[50] While the institutional  response referred to by Madam Justice Martinson has not yet occurred, it is nonetheless  imperative and in the best interests of the children,  the parents and the court for one member of this Court to be seized of any further  applications that may be made in this case. I will therefore remain seized of all such  further  applications. However,  in the case of any application involving urgency  and where, for any reason, I am not available to hear the matter, such urgent  application can be heard by another  member of this Court.

## SUMMARY OF NON-PARTY WITNESS TESTIMONY

- [51] I  do not intend to resolve the numerous  credibility disputes between the parents nor their differing characterization  of the numerous  events  which have occurred in their troubled  relationship. I much  prefer determination of facts made with the benefit of observations from disinterested witnesses. From this latter category, I exclude  family members and witnesses who are clearly advocates for one party or the other.
- [52] I  set out below a summary  of the evidence provided by all of the non-party witnesses in this case. I apologize to any  readers of this judgment  for the resulting increase in the length  of these reasons, however,  I consider the description of factual  events made by the disinterested lay witnesses to be generally  accurate and reliable.

- [53] It  is also hoped that,  in the event  yet another member of this  Court is required to adjudicate any further  proceedings in this matter, the evidence summaries below will provide useful  context  for the conclusions  reached and orders made at this time.

[54] As well,  I am directing that a copy of these reasons be provided to the therapists and counsellors  currently  assisting the parties so that they might have a better understanding  of the facts determined by the Court, the rulings  made, and therefore  the context  in which  future  therapy  may play a helpful  role.

## Mother's Lay Witnesses

## Dr. Darcy Nielsen

- [55] Dr. Nielsen is the former family doctor for the G. family.  She went to medical school with the mother.
- [56] Dr. Nielsen described an incident which  occurred on April 3, 2013. I accept her evidence as an accurate and reliable recounting  of the event.  The father had made appointments for T. and S. to attend upon Dr. Nielsen in the afternoon  of that day. He called Dr. Nielsen's receptionist from the parking lot indicating that T. was in the car, crying, and refusing to go into the doctor's office. He asked the receptionist to have Dr. Nielsen go down to the parking lot to encourage T. to attend. Dr. Nielsen refused.
- [57] The father called three times from the parking lot. He also came into the office to directly request assistance. Eventually,  Dr. Nielsen's receptionist went outside and T. ultimately  came into the office.
- [58] Dr. Nielsen spoke with the father  in a separate examination  room. He wanted a note stating that T. was afraid of him. He wanted Dr. Nielsen to know that  he had not seen his children and that  they were being kept from him. She told him that this was not a medical issue and not a situation in which she would become involved.
- [59] Dr. Nielsen then spoke with T. She was visibly upset, shaking and tearful. However, T. would not disclose why  she was upset. At T.'s request, Dr. Nielsen

called the mother who arrived shortly  thereafter  to pick T. up. At Dr. Nielsen's request, the father had departed the doctor's office in the meantime.

## Dr. David Hanks

[60] Dr. Hanks is the mother's brother-in-law.  He has known  her for some 30 years. He is a general surgeon  and his wife, the mother's sister, is a family physician.  The mother's family  name is Yoshida.

- [61] Dr. Hanks testified as to his observations and experience with the Yoshida family and the mother's children.  He says the family is very  close-knit and large family gatherings play an important role. All of the children  are 'well raised' and are mature and respectful  in their behaviour.

[62] Dr. Hanks noted that everyone  in the family has busy careers, but  'the kids come first'. He believes it is a 'Japanese cultural  thing',  but he considers it to be an extremely  positive attribute.

[63] Dr. Hanks' recollection  is that the father  was spending a lot of time out of the country,  but he did attend the various family gatherings.  The frequency  and duration of such attendances  dropped off, however,  and he has not seen him at the Yoshida family gatherings for several years.

- [64] Dr. Hanks was listed by the mother  as one of her 'collateral references' to be contacted by Dr. Meuser, the author  of the s. 211 Family Assessment Report prepared in this proceeding dated April 8, 2014. Dr. Meuser called Dr. Hanks while the latter was driving his kids to activities and they  arranged for Dr. Meuser to call him at 8:00 p.m. that evening.  However,  he heard nothing  further  from Dr. Meuser in that regard and no interview  was ever carried out.

## Stephen McBride

- [65] Mr. McBride runs the sailing program at the Royal  Vancouver  Yacht  Club where he is head coach. He has known  the G. family for five to six years. He described the three older daughters as quiet, shy and reserved; however,  in the

past couple of years they have  been 'coming out of their shell'  and interact a lot more with the other children  in the sailing program.

- [66] Mr. McBride described an incident at the yacht  club which  occurred in April 2013. He was on his way to work when  he received a telephone  call to come to the club immediately. The police were in attendance  and Mr. and Mrs. G. had been involved  in a confrontation.  He does not recall the actual outcome,  but he has the impression that the girls, who were in attendance,  were trying  to avoid and ignore the events in question.
- [67] Another  incident occurred on awards night at the yacht  club on November 22, 2014. S., who is a very accomplished sailor, was receiving several awards that  night. Mr. McBride was sitting at a table near the girls and their mother.  At one point, the father came over and took the girls away causing upset and tears in the latter. It 'made everyone very  uncomfortable',  so much so that he and the senior staff produced a written 'incident report' for the club's records.
- [68] On cross-examination,  Mr. McBride acknowledged he has no personal knowledge of what the April police incident was about. He also acknowledged that it was the father who had brought  the girls to the awards night at the yacht  club in November 2014 and that the mother  showed up at the event  as the banquet began. He agreed that S. had already received her awards by the time the father was trying to leave with the children.

## Elizabeth Hind

- [69] Ms. Hind, who is currently  23 years old, taught  the G. girls sailing at the yacht club and was also their nanny/babysitter  for a couple of years. Her working hours would range from two days per week to six days per week depending on the mother's schedule and the father's travel  plans.
- [70] Ms. Hind described the mother as a respectful  and caring mother.

[71] Ms. Hind was one of the 'collateral  informants'  contacted by Dr. Meuser as part of his preparation of the s. 211 report. She was, in fact, the only  one of the five informants  offered by the mother who was actually  interviewed  (he interviewed  all seven of the father's proposed interviewees).

- [72] Ms. Hind was provided with three pages of Dr. Meuser's report which recites the contents  of the interview  of her. She is fairly sure that  Dr. Meuser was not recording the interview and certainly  he did not advise her to this effect. She acknowledges she can no longer remember the exact words that she used with Dr. Meuser, but she is confident that  in many  instances she used different words than  the ones that  appear on the paper.
- [73] Ms. Hind was presented with an affidavit she swore on April 25, 2014 at the instance of the mother's then  solicitor. In  that affidavit, the contents  of which she affirmed at trial, she identifies over a dozen instances where  Dr. Meuser's recitation of her statements  is either inaccurate or never said by her at all. She also expresses concern that  Dr. Meuser's report omitted positive things she had to say about the mother.  In  particular, when  Dr. Meuser asked which parent the girls should  be with in Ms. Hind's opinion, she expressed a preference for the mother  saying she was much more stable and loving  than the father and that she treated the girls kindly and with respect.
- [74] On cross-examination,  Ms. Hind noted that she was in Castlegar going to school for the period September 2013 to April 2014 and had not seen the girls or their parents for some time before the interview.  She has seen the girls a few times since April 2014, but it is essentially  just brief interactions at the yacht  club and she 'can't speak to how the girls are doing today'.

## Jacqueline Horton

[75] Ms. Horton  acted as solicitor for the G. family for a number  of years and has also been a friend to both parents. She gave evidence respecting the sale of her clients' condominium  in Sun Peaks in May 2013, the foreclosure of their home on

Beach Drive in the years 2010 to 2012, and the preparation of travel  consent forms for a family  trip to Bermuda in November 2011.

[76] The value  of the house was once appraised at $9.5 million and was subject to two substantial  mortgages aggregating a little under  $7 million. Because of the equity in the home, there was a six-month  redemption period in the foreclosure proceedings, but the sale of the home proved difficult. The price kept getting reduced over a period of some 18 months  and the only reasonable offer, which was accepted and finalized  in March 2012, was approximately  $4 million.  The mortgagees took a substantial  loss.

[77] The Sun Peaks condominium was actually  owned by 6015 Valley Drive Holdings Ltd., a company owned by the G. family.  At one point, the shareholdings were restructured  so that  the two parents held the shares as trustees for the children.

[78] By the time the property was sold, the mother  and the father  had resigned as directors of the company  and the father's sister, Dianne Stanton,  was the sole director. Ms. Stanton was the one who instructed  Ms. Horton with respect to the sale transaction.

[79] The sale proceeds were $403,320. They  were disbursed in favour  of certain outstanding  small debts and thereafter  to the two mortgagees, the Toronto Dominion Bank and a certain law firm in Washington,  DC. There were insufficient  funds  to pay out the latter security  in its entirety,  although  a discharge of their security  from title was obtained, and the corporation owning the condominium  received no money  on the transaction.

[80] On the occasion of the father seeking the travel  consent forms in November 2011, he attended Ms. Horton's office. He broke down and cried while describing his marital situation.  He wanted to separate and asked Ms. Horton to prepare a separation agreement.  She told him this could only  be done if both parties to the agreement consented to same.

## Dr. Margaret Sherwood

[81] Dr. Sherwood is a physician who works at the operating room at Victoria General Hospital. She has been the mother's full-time  surgical assistant for the past five years and on an intermittent  basis for some years before that.

[82] Dr. Sherwood described the mother as calm and pleasant with her interactions with other professionals, staff,  the patients and their parents.  She has never heard the mother swear, seen her throw  things, or otherwise demonstrate any behavioural  issues during the time they  have worked together.

## [83] Dr. Sherwood has never met the father.

## Tine Moberg-Parker

[84] Ms. Moberg-Parker is a sailing coach who has known  the G. family for six to seven years. Her two children are approximately  the same age as T. and S. and all of them have gone through  the same sailing programs.

[85] Ms. Moberg-Parker coaches the Provincial sailing teams and supervises their participation in local, national  and international  events.  She travels with the team and has spent a great deal of time with the elder G. girls, S. more than  T.

[86] Ms. Moberg-Parker gave evidence about various events in which  the father had insisted his children participate, even though  they were too young  and inexperienced.  This included a training camp in August 2011, and two regattas in San Francisco. The latter venue  usually  involves  rough conditions with winds of more than  25 knots and it is 'not a kid-friendly  event'.

[87] The father's insistence on pushing his children  into events  at a young  age was part of the impetus for the sailing organization to impose minimum age requirements  for certain events.  Ms. Moberg-Parker says she has had long talks with the father about these issues and, at the end of the day, albeit after the events in question, he has agreed that perhaps the children  should not have been in attendance.

[88] Ms. Moberg-Parker also described how the father would frequently  drop the children  off at events and return  later. The usual practice, particularly  when  it is not a local event,  is for any travelling  parent to be there for the entire event.  This is because the coach is always on the water with the children  and does not return  to shore if one of the children decides to take his or her boat back in.

[89] Ms. Moberg-Parker remembers very well the events  at Lunenburg  in August 2014. She was aware that  a court order had been granted allowing S. to accompany the team for the entire trip to the Nationals (unlike  the previous year when  she missed the first week of preparation before a court order was obtained). S. had tremendous fun  on the trip and was lively  and enthusiastic  right up until  the last day. At that time, the father wanted to come and pick her up in Lunenburg  to take her to the USA the night before the awards ceremony and [S.'s] 'whole  personality changed'.  She 'closed down' and 'didn't talk'.

[90] The father came to the yacht club to collect her gear the day before the team was set to travel home and a screaming match ensued.  Ultimately,  he left the gear behind and Ms. Moberg-Parker took it home the following  day.

[91] S. did stay for that night's celebratory  dinner, but the father showed up very early the next  morning to pick her up and take her to the airport. Ms. Moberg-Parker woke S. up and the latter  pleaded with her to stay with the team. She asked three times if she had to go before leaving.

[92] The G. girls have always  been polite and kind and Ms. Moberg-Parker says the screaming incident involving  S. was very  shocking and in her view,  'totally  out of character'.

[93] For this upcoming summer, S. is in her last year at this particular age group. T. is now ready to perform in her first Canadian Nationals.  The schedule this year will include a training camp in Squamish from June 7 to 8, one week in San Francisco from June 13 to 22, a training camp and the Provincial Championships the first week of July,  and training/racing  in Squamish from August  20 to September 5.

There will also be other BC circuit events throughout.  Total costs for all of this will be approximately  $3,000 per child (S. and T.), plus travel costs and any  equipment costs. There  are no costs for attending  training camps, and participation in the local circuit, which is A.'s direction this summer, is also free of charge.

[94] Ms. Moberg-Parker is aware that  she was identified as a potential collateral interviewee for Dr. Meuser.  However,  she testified that he never contacted her to conduct  any such interview.

## Jean Bigelow

[95] Ms. Bigelow is the principal of the junior  school at GNS in Victoria. She has been at the school for 22 years in both the junior  and senior programs and has been junior  principal for the past four years. She has known  the G. family for approximately  four years, during which time the three oldest girls were in the junior program.

[96] Ms. Bigelow described a couple of incidents in January  and April 2013 when the father turned  up at the school to pick up N. and T. respectively  outside of usual school hours.  She allowed this to occur because he was the father of the children. With respect to the T. incident, the purpose was to take her to the doctor's office and T. did not want to go. Ms. Bigelow insisted that  she accompany her father and she returned  approximately  one hour  later, very  upset. She did not say why  she was upset.

[97] Ms. Bigelow has been provided a copy of the extract  from Dr. Meuser's report describing her interview.  She disagrees with some of the emphasis which appears in Dr. Meuser's account.  For example, she did not say that T. was 'inappropriately anxious',  only  that she appeared anxious.  She also points out that  she has no personal knowledge about the cause of T.'s anxiety  and any statements  attributed to her in Dr. Meuser's summary  were 'pure conjecture'  on her part.

[98] When asked whether,  based on her contact with and observations  of the children  at her school, she had any  concerns about any of the children's physical,

psychological  or emotional well-being,  Ms. Bigelow stated she had no concerns at all in that regard. In  her opinion, these are 'well-adjusted  happy little girls' who are engaged and affectionate and who like school very  much.

## Jacob Burnett

[99] Mr. Burnett  is the middle school principal at GNS. GNS is an independent school which offers education from junior  kindergarten to Grade 12. It  has 700 students  divided between two campuses. The first campus is for junior  kindergarten to Grade 5 on Beach Drive, Victoria. The second campus, for middle and senior school, is located in Pemberton Woods.

- [100] Middle school is for Grades 6 to 8. S. is currently  in Grade 8 and T. is currently  in Grade 6. Mr. Burnett  knows both children well, although  he has had more exposure to S. over the years.
- [101] GNS offers the International  Baccalaureate program (IB). The starting point is the standard BC curriculum,  but the IB program also emphasizes a variety  of additional values  at its core, including  leadership, service and extensive  participation in co-curricular,  non-academic activities. The intent  is to involve  the students  in as many different activities as they  can reasonably  manage so as to broaden horizons and experience. Mr. Burnett  says that children  who are educated in an IB program usually  go on to do very  well in life and research confirms that they  tend to get higher grades at university.
- [102] GNS middle school has an awards program. The school emblem is a griffin. Nine 'Griffin  Awards' are awarded each year, three for each grade of the 180-student  body. These awards are made for exceptional all-around accomplishment and are considered to be a very  notable distinction.
- [103] Mr. Burnett  considers both S. and T. to be very smart (excellent  marks) and also very  involved  in a host of co-curricular  activities. S. received a Griffin Award in 2014. Both children get on well together  and have a wide circle of friends at school.

He has no concerns  regarding attendance,  attitude, behaviours,  interaction with others or their general well-being  at the school.

[104] GNS does not have any sort of express policy dealing with interaction  with parents and children  involved  in high conflict  matrimonial disputes. It  tries to ensure that communication  is with both parents equally  and in most cases, where custody is shared, the school will generally  follow  the desires and instructions  of the parent who has custody  of the children  during the week or other time in question.

[105] In  the case of the G. family, Mr. Burnett  says he has adopted a slightly different regime; he requires mutual  permission from both parents before allowing the children to engage in any additional activities. For example, both S. and T. wanted to be involved  in the school's annual  drama production in 2014-15; however, the father felt that the girls were already too 'stretched'  in their activities and was not prepared to consent  to the additional commitment  required for participation in drama (at least two hours per week including rehearsals on weekends as the production date nears).

[106] Mr. Burnett  recounted an incident which  occurred on Friday, September 5, 2014. The second full  day for the fall term had been completed and all the students had gone home when Mr. Burnett received a message summoning him to the parking lot. When he arrived, the father was there with all five girls, the three younger  ones in the car, and S. and T. outside who were refusing to get into the car.

[107] The father asked Mr. Burnett  to instruct  the children to get into the car. He refused, reminding the father that the school is supposed to be a 'safe place' for children  involved  in marital conflicts and that  it tries to maintain a position of total neutrality.  He spoke with the girls who told him that they did not want to go with their father.  Mr. Burnett  then  consulted  with the head of school who in turn  called the school lawyer.  The latter advised that it was 'up to the girls' as to what  they wanted to do and so the parking lot impasse continued for some additional time.

[108] When Mr. Burnett  contacted N.G. by phone,  he learned there had been some incident involving  the Victoria Police Department in the summer. When  he contacted the Police Department, he was informed that there was a court order addressing custody  and that the girls would  have to go with their father.  He instructed  the girls to get into the car and they  complied.

- [109] The following  Monday,  he was visited by S. who explained to him certain events  which had occurred during a summer trip to the  USA with her father  and which involved  two incidents of pushing  and striking her at an airport. Mr. Burnett says that  upon learning this information,  it was his obligation to report it to the Ministry.  T. also spoke to him later about the same summer incidents. She had evidently  witnessed the incidents and felt uncomfortable  as a result.  Mr. Burnett  said that he again reported this information  to the Ministry.
- [110] Both girls advised Mr. Burnett  that  they had been instructed  by their mother  to tell him about these events.  He considered this unusual  since the events  were now in the past. He thinks that perhaps the information  was being given to him as an explanation  for the girls' refusal to get into the car with their father.
- [111] Mr. Burnett  also recounted  how the Ministry social worker, Kira Maxwell, came to the school several times to meet with the girls. As far as the school is concerned,  it is the student  who decides whether  or not they  wish to meet with any such visitor. S. did consent  to meeting with Ms. Maxwell;  however,  T. refused, saying, 'There's nothing  in it for me.'
- [112] On cross-examination,  Mr. Burnett  acknowledged that all of these cocurricular  activities before, during and after school require 'careful  logistical planning'.  He also is aware that just one month  ago, S. was posting a comment on a website frequented  by children  her age about how she 'hated' her father. He does not monitor this website, but he learns of the activity on it by way of reports from others.

- [113] Mr. Burnett  also confirmed that while the father appears to be frustrated  by his daughters' conduct  at times, he does not raise his voice and appears to be reasonably  calm and collected.

## Constable Jason Ince

- [114] Constable Ince is the police officer who investigated the September 5, 2014 report made by N.G. regarding the interactions  between the father  and S. earlier in the summer. He first sought some advice from others within the department because the allegation involved  conduct outside of Victoria. However,  he obtained a statement  from S. a few days later (her mother  brought S. to the station).  She was a credible witness who described how her father had pushed her down some stairs while visiting her aunt in Detroit and the next  day had slapped her at the Seattle airport. Later that same day, Constable Ince  received a phone call from the school principal respecting an altercation in the school parking lot. The father was at the lot; however,  the children  did not wish to go with him at the time.
- [115] Constable Ince told the principal that the father had custody of the children on certain days and that the children had to go with him whether  they  wanted to or not.

## Heather Schryburt

- [116] Ms. Schryburt  is an assistant at the office of a family  physician,  Dr. How. She testified as to the content  of a conversation  with the father  on February 18, 2015. At the time, the father wanted to speak to Dr. How about taking over the care of the children.  He was informed that Dr. How, who had taken on the mother  as his patient, would not speak to him.
- [117] Ms. Schryburt  testified that, contrary  to a statement  that was later attributed to her in a letter by the father's legal counsel,  she did not say to the father on that occasion that the office was 'under  strict instructions  from the mother not to talk to [the father]  regarding the children's medical matters'.

## Jennifer Grierson

- [118] Ms. Grierson is a sailing coach and has known  the G. family for five years. Most of her exposure has been with T. and S.
- [119] Ms. Grierson testified to several  incidents where the father displayed poor judgment.
- [120] In  June 2011, the two girls, then nine and seven years old, were part of the Provincial team attending the 'heavy  weather'  regatta in San Francisco. It had been recommended that the girls not participate because they  were too young  and small, but the father  brought  them along in any event.  They  were struggling and having difficulty  performing.  They  were unable to make the line for the last race and so the coaches decided to tow them into the dock. They  got upset, saying they  'weren't allowed to go in' and that 'Dad would  be mad at them'.  At the dock, the father had an angry  exchange  with Ms. Grierson, although  she cannot  now remember the exact words. Both girls were crying and he did apologize later.
- [121] At the 2011 Sailwest Championship in Gimli, Manitoba, the  BC attendees travelled  as a Provincial team. Ao., who was only five years old at the time, was part of the novice 'green fleet' and was required to have an individual  coach on the water with her at all times. The father did not act as her coach so Ms. Grierson assigned her own student  to another  person and assumed that role. Ao. did not really wish to sail and so with Ms. Grierson's blessing, she went  into shore, but was promptly  sent out again by the father.  She then  spent the rest of the day in her boat while anchored or travelling  with Ms. Grierson in the latter's boat.
- [122] In  a summer training camp at Porteau Cove, BC in 2012, S. and T. attended with the father and rented a cabin. During the days, the father  was not present. Pick-up time for the children  was generally  3:30 to 4:00 p.m. He did not arrive, but 45 minutes  later made a phone call to advise that he would be another  couple of hours.  He suggested that the girls just be left as they would  be fine in the cabin, but the coaches were not comfortable with leaving a 10 and 8-year-old in such a fashion and so they stayed with them until  he arrived.

[123] Ms. Grierson says that  in the past, the girls were generally  quiet and reserved, but in the most recent year and one-half  or so, she has seen a big change; they  have become much  more social and interact with the other children.  She believes that sailing is really  important for these girls and that while sailing is fun and a 'sport for life', she thinks the social element  of the sport is even more important for them.

[124] Ms. Grierson says that  when the girls attend events with their father,  they tend to be quiet and reserved and do not say much.  When attending  with their mother,  however,  they  tend to be a lot more social and display their personalities.

[125] Ms. Grierson described the time commitment  associated with sailing. It is extensive.  It includes training two to three days a week (Wednesdays for two to three hours,  Sundays  for five hours,  and the occasional Saturday)  for the season that spans the end of April to October. There is a break from training in the months of June and July  so that  children can participate in other sports such  as soccer or baseball. There are nine local sailing events  which take place over weekends (Saturday  and Sunday).  In August,  the Canadian Championships last for one week, sometimes with another week of training beforehand.  The Sailwest Championship lasts four days in the summer.  The San Francisco 'heavy  weather'  regatta is another  optional event  and lasts one week. If the children qualify  for any international  events,  these can last 10 days to two weeks.

## Erik van der Pol

[126] Mr. van der Pol is also a sailing coach and indeed taught  S. her first sailing lesson.

[127]  He described how during the BC Summer Games in 2012 the father asked him to take S. to the airport so she could fly to the  USA. As a result  of that, she had to miss the last two races.

[128] He also described the November  22, 2014 incident at the Royal  Victoria Yacht  Club Awards Ceremony. S. had received her award for the Canadian

Championship (best under 15 sailor) and the father  was then anxious  to leave with the girls. He was quite abrupt and rude. The twins were sitting with their mother and he came over and pulled them off her lap. They  started to cry. It  was an embarrassing and awkward moment, sufficiently  so that  he and two other coaches prepared a written 'incident report' describing the event  for the club's records just in case anything  further  came of it.

## Margot Bernard (Peggy Bain)

- [129] Ms. Bernard owns the Centrepointe Ballet School. She goes by the name 'Peggy Bain'. She has known the G. family  since S. was four years old, i.e., 10 years. All of the G. girls have taken and continue  to take ballet lessons at her school, although  in different programs and at different times.
- [130] The 'season' stretches from September to June.  S. has lessons on Mondays at 4:30 p.m. and Wednesdays at 5:00 p.m., each for one hour.  T. and Ao. have lessons on Tuesdays  and Thursdays,  4:30 p.m. for Ao., followed by 5:30 p.m. for T. The twins attend for 45 minutes  on Tuesdays  at 3:45 p.m.
- [131] All of the girls seem to enjoy  ballet. They  are 'quite keen' and 'work very hard' when  they are in class. All of S., T. and Ao. have  missed quite a few classes. It  is a concern because they  are all enrolled in examination  programs and also have responsibilities for performing at the year-end  show.
- [132] At the end of session 1 in December 2014, Ms. Bernard asked the father  if the girls would  be continuing  in January.  He told her he did not think they  would be coming back because he 'couldn't manage the time'. However,  they  are still currently  enrolled and continue  to attend,  albeit with some missed classes.
- [133] In  February 2015, the father asked Ms. Bernard if the two of them could meet for coffee. She agreed, but only  if ballet was the subject of discussion. He commented at that time that the mother 'had a mental illness'.  Ms. Bernard did not wish to pursue  the matter and there was no further  discussion of it.

[134] In  April 2015, there was a guest choreographer at one of S.'s Wednesday classes. The father  showed up at 6:00 p.m. when there was still 15 minutes to go and wanted to take S. away.  She became embarrassed, but after some discussion, she was allowed to stay.

## Louise Mooney

[135] Ms. Mooney is the head nurse  for the operating room at Victoria General Hospital. She has known  the mother  for 10 years and has worked with her professionally  throughout  that time. She has never received any complaints about the mother who Ms. Mooney described as professional and very level-headed. Ms. Mooney has never heard the mother  swear, throw  things or otherwise behave inappropriately at work.

[136] On cross-examination,  Ms. Mooney acknowledged that she is not a personal friend of the mother,  has never met the father,  and has never seen her interact with her children or family.

## Kimberly Walker

[137] Ms. Walker has known the mother for many years since the mother  attended the same medical school class as Ms. Walker's husband.  She first met the father approximately  13 years ago, shortly  after S. was born.

[138] Ms. Walker recounted  an incident which occurred approximately  10 years ago when the G. family was staying with them. The  father was bathing the girls in the upstairs bathroom  and after 10 or 15 minutes,  water started flooding through  the dining room pot light. It appears that the father was on his telephone  and the bathtub had overflowed.  It  appears that the father had been on the telephone and had left the water running.  She described it as an 'oh darn! parenting moment'.

[139] Ms. Walker described the father as an intense person who was 'always  crisisdriven',  so much  so that at one point she stopped answering the phone when  Caller ID indicated a phone call from him.

[140] Since the mother and father's separation, Ms. Walker has been a selfdescribed 'helper' for the mother.  She lives five minutes away and although  she has three children of her own aged 12, 15 and 19, she is happy to help out when  she can, driving the kids around several times a month,  whether  to activities, dental appointments  and the like. Sometimes when  the mother  was called out to work, she would  babysit to 'relieve the pressure from [S.]'.

[141] Ms. Walker drove S. and T. to one of their counselling  appointments with Shelaine Grant,  a counsellor  with the 'BC Families in Transition'  program. Afterwards, T. told her that the experience was very  helpful  and positive for her, although  S. was more private and Ms. Walker did not get any sense of S.'s impressions.

[142] Ms. Walker has had quite a bit of interaction with the G. children over the last few years. She says they are 'great kids, pleasant and helpful,  although  they all have different personalities'.  She believes they are very  independent and 'don't need parents hovering  over them'.

[143] Ms. Walker remembers being called by the Ministry Social Walker, Kira Maxwell,  one morning in the fall of 2014. The call was very  brief as Ms. Maxwell  was interrupted  and asked if she could call back. She never did make a return  call, nor did she respond to a message that Ms. Walker left for her on her voice mail.

[144] Ms. Walker attended one of the court appearances as support for the mother.  At that time, the presiding judge had to recuse himself because he knew Ms. Walker's children.  However,  Ms. Walker was speaking with the father on that occasion and was told by him that the mother  'is sick and needs help'.  He seemed very  sincere in stating this, but in Ms. Walker's opinion, the mother is not at all unbalanced  and is a capable parent.

## Father's Lay Witnesses

## Kira Maxwell

[145] Ms. Maxwell  is a social worker in the Child Protection Services Division of the Ministry  of Children and Family Development  ('Ministry').  She joined the Ministry  in July  2014 and assumed the G. family file in August 2014. At that time, the mother's counsellor/divorce  coach, Dr. Burima, had reported two incidents of concern respecting the father's parenting.  The first was that he had locked some of the children  in his car for three hours  while attending  a regatta. The other was the alleged slapping of S. and pushing her down some stairs.

[146] Ms. Maxwell  has no personal knowledge of any of the earlier 'Ministry intakes' involving  the G. family,  but she did conduct a review of the file and put together a document entitled 'Evidentiary  File Review' which she used for the purposes of refreshing  her memory  during her testimony.

[147] It  should  be noted that the father provided to Ms. Maxwell,  early on in her file handling,  a copy of the s. 211 report prepared by Dr. Meuser. She read the report and although  she denies that it 'coloured'  her perception of things, she acknowledges it raised issues that 'confirmed her own thinking'  and 'reinforced her own suspicions' respecting parental alienation and preparatory coaching of the children  for their interviews.

[148] The Ministry  file was not put into evidence and the recitation of its contents by Ms. Maxwell  is not proof of the events  described or the Ministry's handling  of the matter before August 2014. Nonetheless,  these contents  informed Ms. Maxwell's understanding  of the background  and therefore her approach to the handling  of the matters that she was required to address in the period following  August 2014.

[149] The first Ministry  report is in March 2011. It  was triggered by Ao.'s disclosure at school of shouting,  name-calling  and hitting in the household.  During meetings with parents, both acknowledged dysfunction  and conflict in the family and both admitted to yelling/swearing  when  frustrated  and to spanking the children from

time to time as a form of discipline. Both parents agreed to counselling  and the Ministry  closed its file.

[150] The next  incident recorded in the Ministry file is in October 2011. At that  time, the father had reported to the counsellor  'verbal  aggression' (swearing) on the part of the mother  and one instance of her allegedly kicking one of the children  in the behind. The file was closed without  follow-up  because the father was out of town and did not seem interested in assisting with the investigation.

[151] The next  incident recorded on the file is January  9, 2013. It was reported to the Ministry by the police, whom the father had summoned  to the residence in the late evening.  The Saanich Police Department's 'Narrative  Occurrence  Report' is in the file and was read by Ms. Maxwell.  The police had been dispatched to a 'domestic dispute in progress', namely,  a verbal altercation  between the father  and mother.  The argument  related to the sleeping arrangements  for the children (the parents were separated, but living in the same home and the children  were sleeping with their mother).  The father had the two youngest  children in his bedroom and the mother was attempting access when some grabbing and pushing occurred.  Things had settled down by the time the police arrived. Both parents agreed to have no further  contact for the remainder of the evening.

[152] The Ministry  is aware that they  are often used as a weapon by parents involved  in high-conflict  marital disputes and they are careful to try and avoid such involvement  unless  actual violence occurs and child protection interests are triggered. This January  9, 2013 incident was treated as a 'custody and access' and not a 'child protection' matter. Both parties were directed by the Ministry to address the dispute through  their respective lawyers.  A determination was made that the children  were not in need of protection.

[153] On January  19, 2013, the father again called the Ministry.  He had returned from a trip to find the house empty and the mother and children gone. Again, the Ministry  treated this as a custody  and access concern,  and the father was advised to speak with his lawyer.

[154] The next  incident recorded on the Ministry  file is February  2013, and again involved  a report by the father.  He accused the mother  of being verbally  abusive to the children,  striking the back of the children's hands,  being denied access to the children,  incidents where the children  were left in the car for long periods of time by themselves,  and the like. The parents were interviewed and the mother did admit to leaving the children in the car from time to time, albeit for shorter periods than was being alleged and under the 'care' of the eldest daughter,  S. (who was almost 12 years old).

[155] The next  report on the file is April 5, 2013 and was again reported by Dr. Burima. It  involved  an incident where, although  the father had been 'taking a break' from the children as a result  of a mediation agreement, he showed up at school to pick up T. for a medical appointment.  T. was extremely  upset. The Ministry determined that again, this was not a 'child protection concern',  but rather  was a custody  and access matter. On May 1, 2013, the Ministry wrote a letter to the father explaining  the department's role in terms of child protection and recommending that he contact BC Families in Transition  and look into the 'Caught in The Middle Program' for the children.

[156] Ms. Maxell  herself handled  the August 2014 incident, albeit with assistance from her supervisor.  She interviewed all the children  separately in mid-September and also did a follow-up  interview with them in late October. She interviewed  the parents and also spoke with some of the 'collateral  contacts' that had been provided.

[157] The father denied slapping S., but acknowledged he 'tapped her' on the side of the face. He demonstrated to Ms. Maxwell  a single contact, patting the side of his cheek with the palm of his hand, leaving her with the impression that  it was an 'attention  getting mechanism' and not a forceful slap. He denied pushing  anyone down the stairs although  he stated that the twins had tripped on the stairs.

[158] For her part, the mother was very  concerned and reported to Ms. Maxwell that the children were 'severely  traumatized'.

[159] S. demonstrated a noted dislike for her father  during  Ms. Maxwell's  interview, stating she would not see him if she had a choice in the matter. She called him a 'liar' and described him as 'mean' and someone who 'yells'.  She admitted that she called him 'stupid' whereupon  he slapped her. She also described how he dragged her to the steps and kicked her down the stairs.

[160] The other children also purported to confirm the slapping incident. During her interview,  T. also disclosed to Ms. Maxwell  how in 2010 she had been dragged out of her bedroom by her father and put in the dog cage (kennel)  in the garage. She began to cry, but then 'shut  down' and would not say much more.

[161] Ms. Maxwell  asked the father  about the kennel  incident. He stated the entire thing is completely  fabricated and simply did not occur.

[162] It  was apparent to Ms. Maxwell  that these parents were in a 'nasty'  custody and access battle. However,  she found the manner  in which the children answered questions to be strange and she believed they  were coached in some of their responses. She believes some sort of slapping incident did in fact occur, but considers the varying  descriptions of details to be 'questionable'.  She did not think that the children  were 'severely  traumatized'  as stated by the mother.

[163] In  the late October 2014 interview  with Ms. Maxwell,  S. stated that she had been told by her mother  that her father  had 'lied in court'  and described the slapping incident as 'tapping'. She again labelled her father a 'liar' and restated that  if she had her way, she would  not see him at all.

[164] At the end of the day, knowing that the matter was before the courts and that the family was in a comprehensive  court-ordered  counselling  program with Alyson Jones, the Ministry  made a determination that the children  were not in need of protection and a letter was issued to the father  to that effect.

[165] The next  and most recent incident on the Ministry file occurred on January  13, 2015. The mother had taken N. to the principal at school,  pointed out a scratch on the child's forearm, and accused the father of abuse. The principal did not think this

was significant and indeed was suspicious of the mother's motive in bringing the matter to her attention  and chose not to report it to the Ministry.

[166] Interviews  were again conducted  by Ms. Maxwell,  although  this time T. refused to meet. N. stated that she was taking too long to get dressed, so her father had grabbed her to hurry  up and in doing so scratched her forearm. She did not talk to her father  about it, but she believed it was deliberate because he did not apologize. Ai. said the same thing in her interview  and gave the same rationale for not thinking this was an accident. Ms. Maxwell  again had the impression that the children  had discussed the matter beforehand.

[167] When interviewed,  the father expressed incredulity.  According to Ms. Maxwell,  he had no idea that any  scratch had occurred as no one had mentioned anything  to him and he had no idea that anything  had been reported to the Ministry.  According to her, he seemed genuinely  surprised.

[168] Ms. Maxwell  informed the mother that based on the nature  of the injury  and the interview contents,  she did not suspect any type of child abuse. She says the mother was not pleased to hear that determination,  protesting that  if a person has a genuine concern  about abuse occurring,  then  they must  report it to the Ministry.

[169] At the end of the day, Ms. Maxwell  states that this is a situation where the children  are understandably  caught  up in the middle of a high-conflict  marital dispute and that the Ministry  has no concern at this time that any  of the children  are in need of protection.

## Lynn G.

[170] Ms. G. is the 79-year-old  mother of the father.  She gave no evidence about her son's upbringing.  She did not attend his wedding to the mother.  Indeed,  she did not meet the mother  until  May 2001 at her brother's funeral,  and even  then,  she did not speak to her.

- [171] Ms. G. lives in Midland, Michigan. It appears she has only  met the children on five occasions, for two to three days at a time.
- [172] The first such  visit was in 2012 when  G.G. visited with S. and T. The next was during a June 2013 visit to Victoria. She described the children  as pleasant, happy children  on these occasions.
- [173] In  August 2014, G.G. brought  four of the girls to Midland for a short visit. S. was not present. At that time, she noticed a change in T. who had developed 'a bit of an attitude to her father'.  At one point, Ms. G. took it upon herself to remind T. that one of the biblical commandments  is to 'honour  thy father'.
- [174] In  November 2014, Ms. G. visited her son for a USA. Thanksgiving  dinner. She thought  the children  were non-responsive  and rude and that S. in particular  was behaving badly.  It was, she said, an unpleasant,  trying  day.
- [175] At one point, Ms. G. became so angry with S., she told her in a 'loud, authoritative  tone' that she was 'the nastiest child I'd ever seen'.
- [176] Thanksgiving  dinner started with a blessing. According to Ms. G., when  S. was asked what she was thankful  for, she stated 'I can't wait till this court case is over and I won't have  to see any of you anymore.'  According to Ms. G., T.'s blessing was simply the statement  'Death.'
- [177] Ms. G. has been providing financial support to her son. She has provided him with a credit card with a $2,500 limit which she pays off from her chequing  account. Simply for living expenses over the past couple of years, she calculates  she has given her son approximately  $152,000, not including  the money  she has provided for his legal fees. She says she does not know if she can keep doing this and declared 'I've  assumed the mother's responsibility for spousal and child support!'
- [178] The animosity Ms. G. displays to the mother  was immediately evident  when the latter stood up to try  and conduct cross-examination.  Ms. G. felt obliged to make

a 'statement'  to the mother  before being cut off by the Court and directed to simply answer questions put to her.

[179] Ms. G. acknowledges she has had no contact with the mother in over 12 years. She admits she cannot  recall all of the words that  she used on the occasion of her scolding S. at the November  Thanksgiving  dinner,  but she denies calling the latter a 'malicious bitch'.

## Olga Melounova

[180] Ms. Melounova  speaks imperfect English with a heavy  accent. She is one of the father's collateral witnesses who was interviewed over the phone by  Dr. Meuser for the purposes of the s. 211 assessment and report. It  is clear from her presentation  in court that  the language  and syntax  ascribed to her by Dr. Meuser in his report cannot  be verbatim quotation.

[181] Ms. Melounova  worked as a nanny  for the G. children,  primarily for Ao., from 2006 (Ao. was six months  old) until  the end of September 2009, shortly  after the birth of the twins. Her position ended at that time as the mother was taking advantage of a nine-month  maternity  leave following  the birth of the twins,  and so both parents were available to look after the children.

[182] Ms. Melounova  has gone back to working for the father since September 2013, again providing childcare for the children during the weeks when  he has parenting time. She generally  works Monday to Thursday  from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., but sometimes on the weekends as well.

[183] Ms. Melounova  was asked about her observations of the mother and the father as parents. She described the mother as being very strict, so much  so that  the girls would become worried about upsetting their mother  if they failed to do things like practise piano and the like. In  her opinion, the mother is a person who 'likes to have things under  control'  and gets very  upset when little things go awry.

[184] Ms. Melounova  remembers an occasion when the mother had left instructions with her that  the children  were not to go outside, but because the mother was late returning  from work, Ms. Melounova  decided to take the children  outside to play on the beach. The mother  became extremely  angry when  she arrived home and found the children outside.

[185] Ms. Melounova  was asked to tell the Court what she remembered advising Dr. Meuser during the telephone  interview.  She did not mention everything  that is set out in Dr. Meuser's report and her memory had to be refreshed by same.

[186] In  Dr. Meuser's report, Ms. Melounova  is said to describe an incident when the mother on one occasion squeezed Ao.'s mouth  until  a chocolate candy she was eating fell out, whereupon  she was then  put in the garage for punishment.  Ao. was only  two or three years old at the time and was crying.  This was an example of how strict the mother was in terms of insisting on eating healthy  food.

[187] Ms. Melounova  confirmed she did indeed advise Dr. Meuser that the mother's behaviour  and language left her concerned that she might at some point become so furious as to lose control  and perhaps do some kind of harm to the children.

[188] Ms. Melounova  describes the father as being much  more easy-going and the happier parent who would  keep the children calm. He was always very  nice with the children,  frequently  giving them little gifts. He would play music and would dance with them. Unlike the mother,  who rarely displayed affection (hugging  and kissing), the father has always  been affectionate with the children.  She observes him to be very  patient, especially with the older girls with whom he has really  tried to foster a relationship.

## Laurie Kelley

[189] Ms. Kelley,  who has two children  (twins) of her own who attend GNS, met the G. family  in September 2009 when  their children were in Grade 1. She has had a number of contacts with the G. family during the period 2009 to 2013, although

primarily with the father who seemed to do most of the dropping off and picking up at school.

[190] Ms. Kelley describes herself  as a 'school parent'  whose role is to 'keep parents busy'.

[191] Ms. Kelley is clearly  an advocate for the father  in this proceeding and displayed an obvious antipathy  for the mother.  During her testimony  on behalf of the former, she broke into tears on several occasions as she was describing her observations of the mother and the father,  their children  and their home. During cross-examination  she became combative and argumentative.

[192] Most of Ms. Kelley's observations respecting the G. children  related to T. who, at one point in time, was best friends with Ms. Kelley's daughter,  G.K. Apparently,  T. 'shut  G.K. out' in early spring 2013, upsetting  the latter considerably. G.K. told Ms. Kelley that T.'s reason was 'my mummy  says your mummy  is bad'.

[193] Ms. Kelley expressed the view that the mother was 'too hard on the kids' and in Ms. Kelley's opinion, it amounts  to 'abuse'.  She has observed the mother yelling at the children  in a loud voice, telling  them to 'hurry  up!', 'get in the car!' and the like, and she has seen the mother  jerk the children's arms to hurry  them along and slap their hands.  She described her conduct  as 'militaristic' (ordering people around and enforcing discipline).

[194] Ms. Kelley says she would see the children  emerge from class happy and laughing  with their classmates and then  immediately change demeanour the moment they saw their mother.  They  would  hurry  to meet their mother and stop talking to their friends.

[195] Ms. Kelley has visited the G. house on many occasions, mostly  during the course of picking the children  up or dropping them home. When  she did the latter, she would  invariably  take the children  inside the house  and so had an opportunity  to view the interior. She described it as 'filthy'.  She saw uncovered  half-eaten  dinners in the fridge. The previous night's food would still be sitting on the table. The high

chairs had mold growing on them.  The floors were covered with clothes. The bathroom was grimy and wet laundry  was sitting in the dryer molding.

[196] Ms. Kelley confirms some of the statements  she made to Dr. Meuser during their interview.  She acknowledged telling  Dr. Meuser that in Ms. Kelley's opinion, the mother has some sort of psychological  dysfunction  and that there is 'clearly  a mental health  component'  in the mother's conduct.

[197] According to Ms. Kelley, just  the day before her testimony,  T. had been declaring in the school gym that  'G.K.'s mom thinks I'm ugly  and mean'. Ms. Kelley was informed of this by her daughter in front  of three Grade 6 girls she was transporting  in her car.

## Psychologist and Counsellor Witnesses

## Dr. Peter Meuser

[198] On July  16, 2013, this Court ordered the preparation of a report pursuant  to s. 211(1) of the Family Law  Act by a psychologist to be selected jointly  by both parties. This was not a consent order. The application had been opposed by the mother.

[199] The parties eventually  agreed to retain Dr. Peter Meuser for this assessment. The joint retainer letter signed by counsel for both parties was issued to Dr. Meuser on September 11, 2013.

[200] Dr. Meuser has been a registered clinical psychologist  in British Columbia since 1980. He obtained his Ph.D. in clinical psychology  at the University  of Ottawa in 1978. He testified that for the last 10 years his practice has been devoted almost exclusively  to psychological assessments for the purposes of court proceedings. He estimates that he has prepared over 400 assessments in the past 20 years pursuant  to s. 211 of the Family Law Act or its predecessor legislation.

[201] Dr. Meuser says he has considerable experience with parental  alienation, estimating that  as many as 25% of his cases have involved  some component  of

same. While he has not attended any  seminars or courses expressly  devoted to alienation, nor has he himself written any  papers or conducted any research in the area, he says he has read extensively  on the subject and is familiar  with both the research and the 'pivotal' publications on the subject.

[202] Dr. Meuser's report is dated April 8, 2014. It comprises 141 pages, unfortunately  without  the benefit of any table of contents.

[203] For the purposes of his report, Dr. Meuser:

- reviewed thousands  of pages of documents  including  many of the affidavits sworn in the litigation between the parties and hundreds  of emails and related documents  forwarded largely by the father;
- listened to more than  15 hours  of covert  audio recordings made primarily by the father during his 'access visits';
- interviewed and undertook formal psychological  testing of both the mother and the father;
- interviewed the three oldest daughters;
- attended each parent's home to observe their interactions with the children  (one observation in the mother's home and three observations in the father's home, the latter because of the complicated parenting routine which disallowed all five children  in the father's home at one time); and,
- conducted phone interviews  with various 'collateral  informants'  identified by the parties.

[204] With respect to the covert audio recordings, Dr. Meuser commented in his report:

The writer notes that literally everyone involved, including the children, at times covertly recorded conversations, parent-child visits, etc. using cell phones. Sadly, this fact underscores the profound and consistent levels of mistrust and animosity which is a prevailing characteristic in this family group

and hints at the roots of their noted troubles in achieving workable and mutually acceptable co-parenting routines.

[205] Large portions of Dr. Meuser's report recite what purport to be interviewee quotes. These quotes are italicized and presented within quotation marks. While Dr. Meuser does not record his interviews,  he says he takes meticulous  notes (over 200 pages in this case) and that the italicized materials are 'direct quotes'.

[206] Dr. Meuser was successfully  challenged  on cross-examination  about the accuracy  of his purported quotes. It quickly  became apparent that many  of the purported quotes were not in fact a verbatim transcript of notes, but rather  had been subjected to some editing.

[207] One telling example put to Dr. Meuser related to his interview  of Jean Bigelow, the principal of the junior  GNS. The quote set out in the report reads:

I felt [T.] w as inappropriately anxious because of [N.G.'s] expressed concerns, and she had a hard time trusting me since I had left her with her Dad years ago.

## [208] Dr. Meuser's notes actually  read:

I felt [T.] was a bit anxious as she had a hard time trusting me since I had let her Dad take her years ago.

The attribution  of T.'s anxiety  to '[N.G.'s]  expressed concerns'  is not found anywhere  in the notes.

[209] As indicated elsewhere in this judgment,  other witnesses have also testified as to the inaccuracies in Dr. Meuser's purported quotes. His notes were not put into evidence and a word for word comparison has not been undertaken.  Nonetheless, the evidence is compelling,  and I am obliged to conclude,  that the purported quotes in the report are not in fact verbatim reporting, but are the product of editing that  has to some extent  imported error and inaccuracy.

[210] Another  major cause for concern  with respect to Dr. Meuser's report relates to his interviews  of the collateral  informants.  The father  identified seven such  persons

to be interviewed and the mother  identified five. Dr. Meuser interviewed all seven  of the father's proposed interviewees,  all but one on April 4, 2014, and only  interviewed one of the five interviewees suggested by the mother (Ms. Elizabeth Hind, who was interviewed on April 6, 2014).

[211] The other four interviewees proposed by the mother all testified at trial. They include her therapist, Dr. Burima; her brother-in-law,  Dr. Hanks; the children's sailing coach, Ms. Moberg-Parker; and the family  physician, Dr. Nielsen. He says he attempted to contact all of these individuals  multiple times on April 6, 7 and 8 (the latter being the date of the actual  report) with the exception of Dr. Burima. With respect to this latter interviewee,  Dr. Meuser stated in his report, 'no number  given', but acknowledged on cross-examination  that he had actually  worked with Dr. Burima in the past and that  her contact information  was readily available, whether  from the College of Psychologists or simply the Internet.  He has no valid excuse for not contacting the one person who might have had the most informed professional insight of all the interviewees into the mother's psychological makeup, namely, her own treating psychologist.

[212] It  appears from Dr. Meuser's testimony  that the mother launched  a complaint against Dr. Meuser with the College of Psychologists and that he acknowledged the section of his report respecting the collateral  interviews was 'compromised'. He says he would  have liked to have had more time with these interviews,  but the 'report had to be done for court',  that he was told it simply 'had to be finished' and therefore, a 'trade-off'  was the result.  Neither the substance  nor outcome of the complaint to the College was put in evidence at trial.

[213] The mother accuses Dr. Meuser of bias. I do not believe such bias exists; however,  there are several aspects of Dr. Meuser's report that could be construed as lending support to the proposition. They  include:

- inappropriate comments on the mother's appearance ('humbly  dressed in … frumpy  and aging, loose-fitting [clothes]'  with 'scuffed worn shoes,

oversized wool socks (at times two pairs) and a ponytail'  such that she 'did not match the image one might expect of a paediatric surgeon');

- a 'clinical assessment' of the mother which,  while it is expressly  said to 'fall short of a formal diagnosis', nonetheless  concludes  she has 'significant characteristics synonymous  with … several clearly-defined Personality  Disorders', including  Paranoid Personal Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality  Disorder (the characteristics of which are then recited at length);
- several interviews  and observations of the father were conducted before any interviews  and observations of the mother were made, contrary  to the 'staggered' approach to such  interactions that had been contemplated  by the parties;
- receipt and review of enormous  volumes  of additional, largely  self-serving documentation  from the father during the process (which  was not shared with the mother),  including the latter's identification of the mother's 'mental  health  issues' (including,  perhaps not coincidentally,  ObsessiveCompulsive Personality  Disorder and Paranoid Personality  Disorder), as well as submissions respecting 'extreme  parental alienation' (a phrase used, and conclusion  ultimately  reached, by Dr. Meuser in his report);
- use of language that  does not reflect the objective, dispassionate analysis expected from an expert witness (describing at various points the father's conduct  as 'heroic', 'someone should offer him a medal'; child behaviour that is 'horrendous';  'disturbing' personality  characteristics of the mother who has 'systematically  and willfully  engaged' in a 'toxic, destructive  and systematic pattern of alienation' which  has 'wreaked devastation  in the relationships between [G.G.]  and his oldest two daughters');
- failing to interview  the mother's collateral  witnesses; and

- devoting a substantially  disproportionate part of the report to the recitation of the father's interviews  and collateral  witnesses in comparison to those of the mother.

[214] These matters are all cause for concern and it may very well be that the scheduling  of interviews and the receipt of supplementary  information  from the father has influenced  the conclusions  ultimately  reached by Dr. Meuser. But this does not detract from what is perhaps the most compelling part of his report, namely,  his observations of the children's conduct in the presence of their father. In  his testimony,  he described the behaviour  as 'atrocious' and 'the worst I have ever seen in children'.  In  his report, he described their screaming, shouting,  insults, swearing and expressions of hate for their father. He comments:

The writer will not document every foul and abusive word shouted by these children at their father [G.G.], but suffice it to state that this parent-child observation was without exception the most difficult such observation the writer has conducted in nearly 40 years of professional psychological practice. Never have I seen two young children more hostile and blatantly rude to a parent than [S.] and [T.].

[215] In  the Conclusions  and Recommendations  portion of his report,  Dr. Meuser lists a variety  of criteria often used to identify parental  alienation. Some of the criteria so identified include:

- the child indicating fear and hatred of the targeted parent;
- the child denigrating the targeted parent to friends, family and the public;
- the child creating public scenes involving  untoward  language to embarrass or denigrate the targeted parent;
- the child making false allegations involving  the targeted parent;
- the child displaying severe opposition to contact with the targeted parent;
- the lack of credible or compelling evidence to support the child's usually weak or frivolous  explanations  for the rejection of the targeted parent;

- the targeting parent believing they  are 'protecting'  the child, which  beliefs may develop a delusional or obsessive quality;  and
- the targeting parent voicing support of the targeted parent, yet consistently acting in a manner  that suggests the opposite.

## [216] Having regard to these criteria, Dr. Meuser concludes:

Overwhelmingly, the evidence gleaned during this assessment, from multiple clinical interviews and observations with parents and children, to documented, anecdotal and collateral information from informed sources, points to Parental Alienation  as the root of the noted dysfunction in this family and the ongoing litigation.

[217] Dr. Meuser expresses the opinion that the root cause of the ongoing struggle between the parents respecting custody of and access with the children  'lies in the unshaken  belief by [the mother]  that [the father]  is or has been abusive with the children'.

[218] Rather surprisingly,  Dr. Meuser's report contains very  little commentary  on the specific needs of the five children  and how their present or future  psychological and emotional well-being  is impacted by the alienation he perceives to exist. He simply says:

Allowed to continue unabated, the distress for these bright children might well derail their otherwise brilliant futures … From a professional perspective, all children are better off having healthy and supportive relationships with both good parents. Parents who wilfully and without just cause, separate or alienate children from their other parent, if that parent is in fact a 'good' parent, are damaging their children.

## [219]  Dr. Meuser then makes several recommendations:

- the residency and access arrangements  for the three youngest  children should  reflect a more balanced and equal routine  for both parents;
- the father's then-existing  'dysfunctional  access routine'  to the two oldest children  (Thursday  evenings  from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.) should  cease immediately; and

- a treatment  program should  be immediately ordered for the two oldest children,  designed specifically to deal with their profound  alienation from their father.

[220] In  his report, Dr. Meuser identified three treatment  programs in British Columbia and the USA which have 'excellent  reputations'  for addressing and repairing parental alienation, namely:

- the 'Family Forward Reunification  Therapy  Program' designed and operated by Alyson Jones in West Vancouver;
- the 'Family Reflections Reunification  Program' operated by Dr. Kathleen Reay in the Okanagan;  and
- the 'Family Bridges: A Workshop for Troubled and Alienated Parent-Child Relationships'  program developed by Drs. Rand and Warshak in the USA.

[221] Dr. Meuser was testifying at trial fully  one year after his s. 211 report had been issued. By that  time, all of his recommendations had been imposed as a result of various court orders. Parenting time was divided on an equal basis and participation in the Alyson  Jones program had been underway  since the early summer of 2014.

[222] Before testifying,  Dr. Meuser had been provided with all of the Alyson  Jones minutes of meetings and progress reports. He observed that Ms. Jones agreed with him that alienation was the issue for this particular  family. He observed that  the mother is the obstacle to progress and that the failure of the Jones program to remediate the family  dysfunction  lies not with the program itself, but rather  with the mother's failure to genuinely  participate.

[223] On cross-examination,  Dr. Meuser was challenged  with the proposition that the children's alienation from their father was in fact estrangement  triggered by the father's conduct.  He acknowledged that violence toward the children  such as pushing  and slapping could certainly  have a significant impact on the children's

attitude and behaviour,  as could poor parenting such as abandoning children to their own devices at challenging  sporting events  or rousing them from bed in the middle of the night  for travel.  He was adamant, however,  that the reaction of the older children  to their father,  as evidenced by his own  observations, the hours of audio recordings, and the reports from third parties, went 'far beyond estrangement'  and could only  be reasonably  explained by persistent parental alienation on the part of the mother.

[224] Dr. Meuser acknowledged that  the children  were 'amazing young  ladies' insofar as their accomplishments  are concerned,  but he noted that it is possible for them to have a crisis in one aspect of their lives (parental relationships)  that does not spill over into other aspects (performance  at school, peer relationships,  etc.).

[225] Dr. Meuser concluded his testimony  by observing that successful  reunification of this family is still possible. He has grave reservations  that the mother's attitude is too entrenched  and that  she will consciously  or unconsciously  undermine  any treatment  program, but he suggests crafting a regime that will somehow compel the mother's participation in the program in a genuine way, failing which there should be resort to one of the alternative  programs which  would involve  the total exclusion  of the mother in parenting of the children until  relationship repair with their father had been sufficiently  established.

## Dr. Gloria Burima

[226] Dr. Burima is a Registered Psychologist with over 30 years' private clinical practice experience.  She has been preparing s. 211 reports (and similar reports under previous legislation) for 14 years and has been a qualified Parenting Co-ordinator since 2007.

[227] Dr. Burima was initially hired by the mother  as a 'divorce coach', but once the mediation between the parties failed and the attempt at collaborative  process fell away, she eventually  morphed from a role as coach to one of therapist for the mother.  She has generally  being providing therapy  once a month,  sometimes twice, for sessions that last one hour or one and one-quarter  hours.

[228] Dr. Burima says she has an ethical obligation to report to the Ministry  any events  that are brought  to her attention  which  might amount  to child abuse. She does so 'without  evaluating  the accuracy'  of such reports and she acknowledges that her various reporting of incidents to the Ministry  to date has been based exclusively  on information  provided to her by the  mother.

[229] The mother provided Dr. Burima with a copy of Dr. Meuser's s. 211 report as soon as it became available in April 2014. She has known  Dr. Meuser for many years and has much respect for his work; however,  she was dismayed by the methodology,  content  and conclusions  set out in the report. She wrote a four-page letter dated April 23, 2014:

... recommending that as soon as possible, a Review Letter be prepared by a qualified Ph.D. registered psychologist, who has experience completing s. 211 Assessment Reports and is an expert in the areas of Parental Alienation,  Parental Alienation  Syndrome, and Parental Estrangement.

[230] Dr. Burima says she has all of the stated qualifications but, because she was (and still is) the mother's therapist, it would not be ethical for her to perform the full  critique she was recommending.  Even so, she identified in her letter some 17 questions and concerns  that 'most definitely  require review by a qualified s. 211 assessment psychologist,  before any changes in parenting responsibilities and arrangements are made' for the G. family.

[231] The questions and concerns  occupy some three pages of the letter. They suggest 'possible bias' on the part of Dr. Meuser in favour  of the father,  and flawed methodology.  All of these 'concerns'  are not recited here, but they include  the following:

- Dr. Meuser contacted seven of the husband's suggested collateral interviewees, all of whom were interviewed, and discussed in 20 pages of the report, whereas Dr. Meuser only interviewed one of the five interviewees suggested by the wife (including Dr. Burima herself who was not contacted and who as the wife's therapist would have had valuable information to impart);
- When psychological testing produces 'marginally valid' results (as occurred with the husband), second testing usually produces valid results, but this was not done;

- Even though the test results do not support any such diagnosis, Dr. Meuser has made his 'own clinical assessment' and diagnosis of Paranoid Personality Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder without adequate or sufficient clinical information or testing;
- The parent-child clinical observations were 'inequitable' with much less time being spent on the observation of the wife's interaction with the children than the husband's;
- Dr. Meuser's 'repeated and outraged analysis' of the wife and his diagnosis of 'Parental Alienation  Syndrome' failed to systematically address the most recent research and criteria on the subject and did not appear to even consider alternative possibilities such as estrangement (conduct by the parent, here the father, that results in the child's withdrawal from affection);
- The twins could have and should have been interviewed and the three older children should have been interviewed using 'projective interview techniques' (drawings, colours, etc.).

[232] In  her testimony,  Dr. Burima expanded on some of these themes. She suggested that the report failed to clearly  identify the interests and needs of the children,  as opposed to the perceived deficiencies in the mother's personality. The girls' primary teachers should  have been interviewed as children subjected to parental alienation usually  display emotional disturbance and are not well-adjusted as the G. girls appear to be. She believes some of the described behaviour  by the girls is consistent with estrangement  just as much  as alienation.

[233] If  she had been interviewed by Dr. Meuser,  Dr. Burima says she would have advised him that she has not observed any mental illness on the part of the  mother, but rather sees her as a competent, dependable person who is extremely  stressed by the separation and ensuing  high level of conflict.

[234] Dr. Burima was supplied by the mother with copies of the reports/minutes  as and when received from Alyson  Jones &amp; Associates. She has read them all. She disagrees with that program's approach and particularly  with the questioning  of children  in front  of the very  parents about whom  they are being asked. She believes this is contrary  to the basic requirements  of therapeutic treatment,  namely,  trust  and confidentiality.

[235] Dr. Burima spoke with Ms. Jones once in June  2014. She queried whether estrangement  had been considered, at which time Ms. Jones expressed the view that this was a 'hybrid' situation,  i.e., elements  of both estrangement  and alienation were at play. However,  Dr. Burima believes that  Ms. Jones accepts this as a parental alienation situation and indeed she has heard Ms. Jones talking about this case at a conference  and describing how extreme  an example of alienation this was.

[236] Dr. Burima recommends consultation  with Family Services of Greater Victoria to obtain (or resume) private counselling  for the girls, particularly  S. and T., along with separate counselling  by different counsellors  for the parents with one counsellor 'co-ordinating the linkage' with the therapeutic  requirements  of all concerned.

[237] Dr. Burima was unaware that the mother had already made applications to the court for a review of Dr. Meuser's report and the commission of a further  s. 211 report, both of which requests were denied on October 28, 2014. In  her opinion, this 'still  needs to be done'.

[238] On cross-examination,  Dr. Burima acknowledged she has had limited contact with the father, although  she emphasized that she saw him display a complete lack of empathy  throughout  the mediation process. She acknowledges that her understanding  of the facts in this case are based solely on the descriptions provided by the mother,  although  somewhat supplemented  by the Alyson  Jones material. She also acknowledges that it would  be inappropriate for the  mother to even discuss the litigation with the children,  let alone encouraging participation by way of writing letters.

[239] Overall,  it is Dr. Burima's opinion that the flawed s. 211 report by Dr. Meuser and his questionable diagnosis of extreme Parental  Alienation Syndrome  has sent the court, the Ministry and the Jones' therapists in the wrong  direction.

[240] Many of Dr. Burima's observations deserve respect. I might add, however, that she does appear to be actively  advocating the mother's position in this case and, while support for one's client is no doubt important, it is hoped her future

therapy  with the mother  will assist the latter  in implementing,  rather than resisting, the rulings and directions made by the Court at this time.

## Alyson Jones

[241] Alyson Jones is a Registered Clinical Counsellor  who specializes in child and family therapy  in high conflict divorce situations.  She also has qualifications as a Parent Co-ordinator and Mediator.

[242] Ms. Jones is the president and director of a counselling  and therapy  centre in West Vancouver,  BC. Among other programs, the centre operates a 'Family Forward Counselling  Program' which  is designed to assist both children and parents in high conflict divorce cases. The program uses a team approach where a parenting therapist and a child therapist work together in family sessions as well as individually with family members. Ms. Jones acts in the role of clinical supervisor and 'team leader'.

[243] Ms. Jones says that in high conflict cases, such as the one at bar, her role is to 'advocate for the children  and not for the parents' and that her group will develop a set of guidelines or 'rules  of engagement'  designed to protect the children from the conflict between their parents, to develop conduct  boundaries and resiliency skills, to reduce stress and anxiety  in the children,  and to encourage a healthy  relationship with both parents.

[244] It  is a requirement  of the program that both parents participate and also execute  a 'Treatment  Program Agreement'.  Among other things,  that Agreement requires the parents to 'overtly  support the therapy  and the therapists to the children'  and also purports to forbid 'unilateral  withdrawal'  from the program.

[245] In  this case, on May 1, 2014, Mr. Justice MacKenzie issued an order requiring the parties and their two eldest children,  S. and T., to be forthwith  enrolled  in the Family Forward Counselling  Program run by Ms. Jones. The order directed that the parents 'follow  any reasonable treatment  recommendations made by the therapists

at the Alyson  Jones &amp; Associates Family Forward Reunification  Therapy  Program for so long as directed by the treating professional or further  Court Order.'

[246] In  October 2014, the mother  applied to vary Mr. Justice MacKenzie's order to terminate the treatment  by Alyson  Jones &amp; Associates and appoint a different therapist in their place. The application was dismissed by Mr. Justice Pearlman on October 28, 2014.

[247] It  is Ms. Jones' practice to draft detailed minutes of each 'family  team meeting' as well as occasional 'progress reports with recommendations'. Sixteen such minutes  and reports were put into evidence detailing issues, problems, assessments and recommendations/agreements  made at the numerous meetings and therapy  sessions spanning the period May 20, 2014 through  April 18, 2015.

[248] While Ms. Jones is of the view there was significant progress at the beginning of the program (May and June 2014), she opines matters have  since stalled or even regressed. Ms. Jones is of the view that  the mother  has demonstrated 'a high level of resistance' to the program and she has 'serious concerns'  regarding the authenticity  of the mother's commitment to same.

[249] The Jones group prepared a document dated July  18, 2014 entitled '[G.] Family Rules of Engagement and Parenting Time Guidelines'.  It is six pages long and contains some 51 separate directions respecting communications  and conduct. Ms. Jones says it is imperative for both parties to follow these guidelines, 'in order to create a healthy  future  for the children'.  Her opinion is that a securely  attached relationship with both parents is critical to the children's long-term  well-being  and the rules of engagement are designed to try and promote such  relationships.

[250] It  is apparent from even  a cursory  reading of the detailed guidelines that both parents have failed to comply and that such non-compliant  conduct  continues  to this day. Ms. Jones says that  these parents are simply not able to make decisions together well and that  if no structure  for decision-making exists, 'the next  year is going to be wasted'.

[251] The most recent team meeting minutes dated April 18, 2015 illustrate  the difficulties and possibly the futility  of the counselling  program.

[252] The father brought  S., T. and Ao. to the meeting. They  arrived late. The girls initially refused to get out of the van,  refusing even the entreaties of one of the therapists.

[253] Private meetings were held by the counsellors  with all of the attendees. Meetings were also held between the counsellors  and one or more of the parents, along with each of S. and T.

[254] At her meetings, S. declared, both privately  and in front of her father,  that she 'hates' her dad. When  asked what it was about her father that brought  forth this reaction, S. could not provide any concrete examples.

[255] At her meetings, T. expressed the feeling, both privately  and in front  of her father,  that her father lies to her. She broke down and cried, expressing worry  that the court proceedings would  not be fair because her mother did not have a lawyer.

[256] Both parents accused the other of discussing the court proceedings with the children.  Both denied that he/she  had had such discussions. Both children  stated that their father does not talk to them about court, but  that their mother does bring it up.

[257] Both parents received feedback and direction, both privately  and in front of the others. Both were (again) directed to keep the children out of the adult conflict.

[258] As expressed in her February 2, 2015 progress report, Ms. Jones believes the mother exhibits characteristics of 'parental  alienation',  but will not acknowledge any alienating behaviours  on her part. Rather,  she continues to focus on the father's behaviour  instead of considering her own contribution  to the problem.

[259] Ms. Jones defines 'parental  alienation' as the 'aggressive undermining  by one parent of a child's relationship with the other parent'.  She says that S. and T.

are displaying a level of contempt and profound  rejection of their father  that is 'usually  an indicator of parental alienation'.

[260] When asked whether  there is any utility  in continuing  with this Family Forward Counselling  Program for the G. family,  Ms. Jones pointed out that the program is expressly  designed for this type of situation.  She stated her 'realistic view' is that  the family dynamics can be improved and that huge progress could be made if the parents would actually  follow the rules of engagement.  She acknowledges, however, that the dysfunction  is deeply embedded and that it will be a 'long road' ahead.

## Dr. Larry Waterman

[261] Dr. Waterman obtained his Ph.D. in psychology  from the University  of Windsor in 1980 and has practised clinical psychotherapy  since that date. He has written  a variety  of non-peer  reviewed papers which have been published in journals or presented at conferences  and has led specialty workshops dealing with parental alienation. With respect to the latter subject,  he has attended various courses presented by Dr. Joan Kelly (four in total) as well as Dr. Kathleen  Reay, both of whom he considers to be acknowledged experts in the subject.

[262] Like Dr. Meuser, Dr. Waterman has prepared a substantial  number  of assessment reports pursuant  to s. 211 of the Family Law  Act and prior legislation, going as far back as 1982. Unlike Dr. Meuser, his practice is not devoted to such reports, but also includes a private clinical practice in which  he provides psychotherapy  for children,  adults and families.

[263] Dr. Waterman was retained in January  2015 by the then counsel  for the mother.  It was explained to him that a s. 211 assessment had recently  been completed by another psychologist  who had come to the conclusion  that the mother had a number of psychological  disorders. Counsel was requesting a new, independent  assessment of the mother.

[264] Dr. Waterman has not actually  read Dr. Meuser's report. He did, however, obtain the raw data for the Minnesota  Multiphasic Personality  Inventory  - 2 (MMPI-2)

testing that had been administered to the mother by Dr. Meuser in January  2014. This data was re-analyzed  using Dr. Waterman's in-house scoring program and essentially  the same pattern  of results was obtained.

[265] Dr. Waterman conducted a detailed interview  of the mother  on February 2, 2015. He also administered additional psychological  tests which had not been performed by Dr. Meuser, namely,  the 'Personality  Assessment Inventory'  and the 'Millon Clinical Multiaxial  Inventory  - III'.

[266] Dr. Waterman prepared a report respecting his assessment dated March 12, 2015 which was entered in evidence at trial. In  his report, he concludes that the mother is 'essentially  a well-functioning  individual with no major personality disturbances',  but she was also 'going through  a stressful  period in her life' and 'is experiencing some problematic symptoms that  are largely  situational and transient'. He also concludes 'there  was no information obtained suggesting that [the mother] suffers from any severe personality  disorder that would have a negative impact on her ability to parent her children'.

[267] Dr. Waterman is not very familiar with the alienation treatment  program offered by Alyson Jones. He has greater familiarity with the program offered by Dr. Reay and, indeed, has made referrals to that program in a couple of cases.

[268] Dr. Waterman described the features of the Reay program as follows:

- the court must first order the participation in the program;
- the alienated parent and the children will attend the facility in the Okanagan over a period of four to five days, during which intense reunification  therapies are put in play;
- each participant is then  assigned their own therapist, chosen in consultation  with Dr. Reay's team, and a family therapy  plan is developed;

- the children reside with the alienated parent and have no contact with the alienating parent for as long as the therapy  team considers necessary (three months  to 12 months);
- the short term effect upon the children is quite traumatic,  but the long-term effects (family reunification)  far outweigh  the same;
- the success rate within the program is extremely  high;
- the program costs $25,000 for the initial four-day  immersion and thereafter payment must be made to each of the therapists who continue  to be involved  (likely  at least twice per month  at whatever  their hourly  rate may be; Dr. Waterman's hourly  rate is $180).

[269] Dr. Waterman was asked about the consequences to the children of long-term  parental alienation.  He explained they include:

- problems in school;
- problems in relationships  with peers;
- difficulty  with trust  and relationships later in life;
- difficulties in caring for their own children  in the future;
- mental health  problems such as depression and anxiety  along with increased risk of alcohol and drug abuse.

[270] When asked whether  there may be any other alternatives  to the treatment programs recommended by Dr. Meuser, Dr. Waterman posited one further,  perhaps more draconian, intervention:  removal of the children from both parents and granting custody  to a third party,  combined with therapy for the children  (the same therapist), as well as for the parents (with  their own therapists),  leading to a supervised and gradual re-establishment  of a relationship with both parents.

## DIVORCE

[271] Both parties seek an order granting a divorce. The evidence clearly establishes that they were living separate and apart at the commencement  of this proceeding and have continued  to do so since that time. This is a marriage that has irretrievably  broken down. There has been no collusion in relation to the divorce and reasonable arrangements  will be made for the support of the children  of the marriage. Accordingly,  subject to s. 12 of the Divorce Act , a divorce is hereby granted to take effect on the 31st day following the rendering of this judgment.

## CUSTODY, ACCESS, GUARDIANSHIP AND PARENTING

[272] The husband seeks an order under  the Divorce Act , R.S.C., 1985, c. 3 (2 nd Supp.) granting him sole custody and sole guardianship of all five of the children.  He also seeks an order denying  the mother  any parenting time with the children  except as recommended by the Family Reunification  Therapy  Program in which he proposes to enrol the children.  These orders are claimed to be the only sensible remedy for the destructive  and systematic campaign waged by the mother designed to alienate the father  from all of his children.

[273] The mother,  on the other hand, seeks no particular relief with respect to guardianship but wishes for all the children  to be in her primary care. She also seeks an order granting the husband  parenting time with all five children according to a rotating four week schedule,  that is, a five-four-five  day rotation during the two-week period that the husband  is likely to be in Victoria and, in the event he is actually  in Victoria during the following  two weeks (during  which she anticipates he will be working away from the province), then  he would have  parenting time on each Wednesday after school,  overnight  until  Thursday  morning.  In short,  she seeks to substantially  vary the current  parenting regime to significantly  reduce the husband's parenting time with the children.

[274] The central  issue in this case is whether  or not the children,  particularly  the older children,  are alienated from their father and, if so, what  custody,  guardianship

and parenting arrangements  would best protect and promote the children's longterm physical,  psychological  and emotional well-being in the circumstances.

[275] In  the next  section of this judgment  I discuss the concepts of estrangement and alienation and how the best interests of children  are identified and protected in such circumstances.  Thereafter  I will analyse  these issues in the factual  matrix of the present case and issue orders appropriate to the circumstances.

## Estrangement and Alienation: Concepts and Possible Remedies

[276] In  high-conflict  separations, both parents commonly  attempt to undermine their children's relationship with the other parent. Occasionally  children  reject one of the parents,  resisting or even refusing contact.  It is in such contexts  that the concepts of 'estrangement'  and 'alienation'  are often invoked.

[277] The difference between an estranged child and an alienated child lies in the cause; estrangement,  sometimes referred to as 'realistic estrangement',  is the label applied when  the child understandably  refuses contact with a parent because of the latter's behaviour whether  it be physical  or emotional abuse, rigid or restrictive parenting,  immature and self-centered  behaviour,  and/or dysfunctional  conduct arising from the parent's own psychological  or psychiatric issues. In such circumstances,  the child's rejection of the parent may well be a reasonable and adaptive response to the estranged parent's behaviour.

[278] An alienated child, on the other hand,  is the label frequently  applied when there is little or no objectively  reasonable cause for the child's rejection of the parent and particularly  when  it is the product of the other parent's hostility and antipathy towards his/her  former spouse and the intentional  undermining  by the former of the child's relationship with the latter. While the undermining  of the relationship can arise from direct or indirect behaviours,  in its worst form  the parental  conduct is expressly designed to alienate the child from the other parent. Such conduct  is pernicious and unpardonable.

[279] Before addressing the discussion of estrangement  and alienation in social science literature,  it may be worthwhile  to set out the advantages  lost by a child who is deprived of positive involvement  by both parents following  separation. In  this case, both Drs. Meuser and Waterman acknowledged that one of the leading scholars in the field of Clinical Child Psychology  is Dr. Joan Kelly. She received her Ph.D. from Yale University  and has worked in the area of child and family issues related to separation and divorce for over 45 years. She has authored many  widely respected publications, including:

-  'Using Child Development Research to Make Appropriate Custody and Access Decisions for Young  Children', Family And Conciliation Courts Review ,  Vol. 28, No. 3, July  2000, pp. 297-311;
-  'Developing Beneficial Parenting Plan Models for Children Following Separation and Divorce', Journal of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers ,  Vol. 19, No. 2, (2005);
-  'Parenting After Separation: Addressing Controversies  In A Shifting Landscape', Conference Presentation,  September 29, 2014, Vancouver,  BC.

[280] Some of the relevant  themes emerging from the research described in these and other publications by Dr. Kelly include:

-  Positive involvement  of both parents will usually  best address the developmental  needs of young  children  of separated parents;
-  Quality  of parenting is a central variable and major predictor of child outcomes;
-  Independent  of the positive outcomes of secure attachments  with mothers, secure attachments  with fathers are associated with later positive measures of self-esteem, self-regulation  and compliance, social

competence and peer relationships,  cognitive and verbal skills, I.Q., and emotional and behavioural  adjustment;

-  Young  children with involved  fathers  are more likely to be more sociable as infants,  and will have a greater capacity for empathy,  better peer relationships and fewer behavioural  problems;
-  As children  with involved  fathers grow older, they are more likely to solve problems better, have higher educational  achievement  and more satisfying adult relationships,  and cope/adapt better to difficult life situations.

[281] Contrast these positive outcomes with the potential consequences to children of long-term  parental alienation described in the testimony  of Dr. Waterman and more particularly  referred to in para. 271 of this judgment,  repeated for ease of reference here:

-  problems in school;
-  problems and relationships  with peers;
-  difficulty  with trust  and relationships later in life;
-  difficulties in caring for their own children  in the future;
-  mental health  problems such as depression and anxiety,  along with increased risk of alcohol and drug abuse.

[282] Dr. Waterman's observations are supported in part by one of the rare studies into the lives of adult children  of parental alienation: A. Baker, 'The Long-Term Effects Of Parental Alienation On Adult Children:  A Qualitative  Research Study', The American Journal of Family Therapy , 33:289-302, 2005.

[283] There is much  debate whether  parental alienation on the part of a child should  qualify as a psychiatric diagnosis, i.e. a disorder/syndrome  that should  be

recognized as a form of mental illness in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual  of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Fifth Edition. There are powerful  arguments  that conflicted children,  caught  in the middle of intense and emotionally  charged separation scenarios, should not be labelled as mentally  ill: see C. Houchin et al. , 'The Parental Alienation Debate Belongs In The Courtroom,  Not In  DSM-5,' The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law ,  Vol. 40, p. 127 (2012).

[284] The term 'parental  alienation syndrome'  was first introduced  in 1985 by Dr. Richard Gardner,  formerly  a psychoanalyst  and child psychiatrist  on the clinical faculty  at Columbia University.  In  the ensuing  decade before his death, Dr. Gardner founded his own publishing  company and published over 30 books (Dr. Meuser brought  one of those books to court during his testimony).  Dr. Gardner was highly sought  as an expert witness and testified in over 400 child custody cases in the United States.

[285] The concept of 'parental  alienation syndrome'  has been controversial  since its inception. A particularly  scathing review of its evidentiary  admissibility and scientific validity can be found in J. Hoult,  'The  Evidentiary Admissibility Of Parental Alienation Syndrome:  Science, Law, And Policy', Children's Legal Rights Journal , Vol. 26, p. 1 (2006).

[286] Dr. Joan Kelly,  referred to above, has been one of the more noteworthy  critics of Dr. Gardner's classification of parental  alienation as a syndrome  or disorder: see J. Kelly &amp; J. Johnston,  'The Alienated Child: A Reformulation  Of Parental  Alienation Syndrome', Fam. Court Rev. 39:249-66, 2001, as well as Dr. Gardner's formal rebuttal  and the Kelly/Johnston  response published in tandem, Family Court Rev. 42:611-2001 and 622-8 (2004).

[287] Regardless of academic debate respecting labels and diagnoses, the simple fact of the matter is that alienation is a useful  and important  concept which is frequently  at play in high-conflict  separations and has been recognized as such in numerous  cases before the Canadian courts.  Arguably  the more important questions revolve  around the remedies and approaches taken by the courts to address

alienation in the best interests of the children involved  and to ensure  the protection of psycho-emotional  well-being in both the short-  and long-term.

[288] A very  helpful  review of the legal responses to alienation can be found  in Bala et al. , 'Alienated Children And Parental Separation: Legal Responses In Canada's Family Courts', 33 Queen's L.J. 79 (2007). The various mechanisms often used by the courts include:

-  Detailed case management and parental  conduct orders with cost consequences for non-compliance;
-  Judicial exhortation  urging compliance and emphasizing the emotional harm caused to the children  (generally  only  effective  in less severe cases of alienation);
-  Court-ordered therapeutic  intervention  where appropriate, while recognizing 'force-marching'  a child to reunification may in some cases be unrealistic  and harmful;
-  Ordering supervised access/parenting time to allay any child anxiety  and possibly pave the way for further  strategies to achieve positive relationships;
-  Suspension of child or spousal support as a sanction to enforce more engagement with the other parent;
-  Transferring  custody from the alienating parent to the rejected parent where expert testimony  establishes the long-term  benefits will outweigh any short-term  emotional trauma  to the child;
-  Terminating  access by/parenting  time of the alienated parent when  the alienation is so entrenched  that the 'cure is worse than the illness', recognizing that children  do sometimes resume a relationship  with

a rejected non-custodial  parent after a long period without  contact, albeit perhaps only  in later years.

[289] All of these remedies have been employed by the courts in British Columbia over the years. Recent cases which include detailed discussion of alienation and which exemplify  the breadth and flexibility  of the remedies in the best interests of the children  involved  include:

-  I.S. v. D.J.S. ,  2010 BCSC 306;
-  L.G. v. R.G. , 2012 BCSC 1365; and
-  L.D.K. v. M.A.K. , 2015 BCSC 226.

[290] Some of the observations by Mr. Justice Brown in L.G. v. R.G., supra , resonate in this case:

1. Parental alienation has become a term commonly used in divorce cases to denote the occurrence of breakdown of the relationship between a child and one of the divorcing parents. It most often occurs in cases where the parties have locked themselves into high levels of conflict that often includes custody and access matters.
2. Although alienation of a child from a parent can develop as an inherent side effect of marriage breakdown, deliberate action by a parent, sometimes subtle, sometimes obvious, can also bring it about. Children can become enmeshed in their parents' disputes as parents try to enlist them as a standard-bearer in the parental battles. But young children have not yet developed psychological defences needed to engage in adult disputes and they usually become the first casualty of the wars. It is not surprising that professional literature shows a reliable connection between an increased risk of mental illness and childhood exposure to intense marital conflict battles. Compared with most divorce cases, cases such as these consume a disproportionate number of courtroom days.

…

273. Because it tears away one of the most important moorings in the life of the child, the alienation of a child from a loving parent is a very serious matter. One cannot be anything other than deeply concerned for the children's emotional well-being; but whatever the court ultimately sees as lying in their best interests, only the parties, exercising utmost goodwill, and their own sincere regard for the children's best interests and respect for orders of the court can restore and maintain the healthy relationship of both parents. This is clearly in the best interests of the children.

[291] L.D.K. v. M.A.K., supra , is a case where the court ordered interim sole custody,  sole guardianship and primary residency of the two children (aged 18 and 16) be granted to the alienated father  and also required the parties and the children to be enrolled in the Family Reflections Reunification  Program operated in the Okanagan under the direction of Dr. Kathleen  Reay for a period of at least one year. This is the same program referred to by Dr. Meuser in his s. 211 report as one of the alternative  treatment  approaches in the present case and is the remedy sought by the father.

## Analysis, Findings and Orders Made

[292] Before setting out my conclusions  on the personalities, parenting styles and past conduct of both parents, it is appropriate to first recite the common-sense observation made by the court in K.D.P. v. A.R.K. , 2011 BCSC 1085:

- [1] No parents are perfect. All have flaws of one kind or another. If families stay together, except in those rare circumstances in which a child is found to be in need of protection, the state and the courts allow imperfect parents to raise their children as best they can. The children, in most cases, are no worse for wear for the experience.
- [2] If families separate, however, and issues of custody and access arise, in the guise of determining the best interests of the child, a parent's flaws of character and conduct are put under a microscope. In such circumstances, care must be taken not to lose sight of the strengths that a party brings to the challenge of raising a child.

[293] In  high-conflict  matrimonial litigation, such  as the case at bar, the adversarial system often serves to only increase the acrimony between the parties. People who once loved each other exchange  vile insults  and attach nasty  labels to perceived deficiencies in character.  Friends, family,  police, teachers and ministry  officials are summoned to denigrate one parent and advocate on behalf  of the other. The interests of the children,  best served by the positive involvement  of both parents, are sacrificed on the altar of self-centered  animosity.

[294] All of these things have occurred in this case.

[295] The mother is a widely respected pediatric surgeon,  a profession dedicated to advancing the health  and well-being  of children.  Yet,  for the purpose of this litigation, the father calls her 'a Nazi', 'a beast', 'bizarre',  'violent'  'aggressive' and 'mentally  ill'.

[296] The father,  who is well-educated  and highly  accomplished in the world of finance and who clearly  loves his children,  is labelled by the mother as a violent  child abuser who locks children  in cages and throws them downstairs.  Relatively innocuous  'incidents'  spanning more than  a decade in some instances  are dredged up to establish a 'pattern'  of indifference and incompetency.

[297] There is little doubt neither the mother nor the father  is a perfect parent,  nor will they be in the future.  They  both have flaws. They  have both been guilty  of poor judgment  and unpleasant  conduct  in the past and they  will doubtless be guilty  of the same in the future.  Notwithstanding  such  imperfections, however,  I wish to make it perfectly  clear that the mother is not 'mentally  ill' and the father is not 'a violent  child abuser'. Both parents require an immediate attitude adjustment  in this regard.

## Personalities, Parenting Styles and Past Conduct

[298] I  have had the benefit of closely  observing both parents over 17 days of trial and, of course, listening  to their evidence both in chief and under  cross-examination.

## [299] In  his report, Dr. Meuser observes:

[G.G.] and [N.G.] are noted by the writer to each bring some emotional and psychological 'baggage' to the table, although both are highly skilled and extremely intelligent parents. Psychological testing and reasoned clinical opinion, while falling short of any formal psychiatric diagnoses, indicates both to present with enduring and disabling character dynamics that in combination, most probably played pivotal roles in the dissolving of their marriage, and subsequently in the documented ongoing acrimony, family dysfunction, and child alienation.'

- [300] I  agree with this observation.

[301] During his examination in chief the father  was asked for his perceptions respecting his own role in the present family dysfunction.  To his credit, he replied

that he was equally  as responsible for the present situation as the mother and he acknowledged 'making parenting decisions that were inappropriate at any given time'. I also agree with this assessment.

[302] During his testimony,  and in the history he recited to Dr. Meuser, the father paints himself as being dominated throughout  his marriage by an obsessive, controlling  woman,  who he now labels 'violent'  and 'mentally  ill', and who he says was verbally  and physically  abusing the children over many years. The latter  is in reference to frequent  swearing by the mother and to disciplinary measures that included spanking and 'time-outs'  in the garage. However,  he acknowledges that he too put the children  in the garage for punishment  and that he too is subject  to a flaring temper which  has led to such things as smashing a water pitcher on the floor in front of the children,  or, more recently,  slapping S. in the face at the airport in response to misbehaviour  or acts of defiance.

[303] I  find as a fact that these incidents did occur as did the various incidents of poor judgment  described by the disinterested non-family  witnesses recounted  earlier in this judgment.

[304] One cannot help but wonder whether  the father's own self-described family history  of toxic dysfunction  and long-term  estrangement  from his parents at an early age might have affected his psychological  make-up and approach to parenting. It  must be acknowledged, however,  that  the father  accepts at least partial responsibility for the present family dysfunction  and by all accounts  has complied with and benefited from the counselling  he has received, whether  from Alyson Jones or others. It is my sincere hope the father will continue  to seek out the benefits of such counselling  and that his parental skills will improve accordingly.

[305] When posed a question during his examination in chief, the father would sometimes provide a rambling monologue  of events  as he saw them replete with tears, melodramatic exaggeration and statements  of pride at finally  'escaping' the control of the mother.  I treat his characterization  of various events  with  caution.

However, I accept as genuine his denial of locking T. in a dog kennel or pushing S. down stairs and I find as a fact that such incidents did not actually  occur.

[306] The mother's presentation in court was much  less dramatic and flamboyant. At times she displayed an unemotional,  flat effect. She was, of course, selfrepresented at this trial and, it must be said, performed remarkably  well in difficult circumstances.  She was organized and thorough.  Her arguments  were well-written and logical.

[307] It  was also apparent from the mother's presentation and evidence that she is a demanding person who insists on disciplined conduct and prefers detailed rules and schedules  over more informal  or free-wheeling  approaches to most matters. This no doubt serves her well in her profession but it has also resulted in a certain inflexibility  and lack of cooperation which  has substantially  contributed to the parenting disputes and multiple  court attendances  in this case.

[308] In  her oral submissions the mother emphasized that 'I believe my kids'. This includes everything  they  tell her, whether  it be the father pushing  children down stairs or locking them in dog kennels.  She insists that the views of the children  have not been properly heard in this case and states 'If  I don't do it, who will?'

[309] Dr. Meuser expresses the view that 'the root of the ongoing struggle  between N.G. and G.G. over access with their children  lies in the unshaken  belief by [the mother]  that [the father]  is or has been abusive with the children'.  I accept that this is very  likely the case. As indicated earlier, however,  the various instances of poor judgment  or poor parenting  skills by the father do not amount  to abuse of the children  and there is no proper basis for the mother's belief that child protection is warranted.  As stated before, attitude adjustment  on her part is required.

[310] This, then,  leads to the question which  lies at the heart of this case, namely, alienation.

[311] The evidence clearly establishes that the two eldest children  have become increasingly  alienated from their father.  I agree with both Dr. Meuser and Alyson

Jones that the level of antipathy  displayed by the eldest children,  both verbally  and in their conduct,  is not likely the result solely  of the father's occasional poor judgment or lapses in parenting  skills. There is no doubt, and I find as a fact, that the alienation has also been caused in very  large measure by the conduct of the mother. It  is important  to note there is virtually  no evidence in this trial respecting the private communications between mother and children  and so not all of the mother's alienation behaviours  can be readily identified. Nevertheless,  her alienating conduct  includes:

-  leaving the home and removing the children from the reach of their father without  prior discussion or notice;
-  effectively  preventing  the father from having  any meaningful  access to the older children  throughout  2013;
-  resisting and objecting to all attempts by the father to increase access to and parenting time with the children,  frequently  invoking  the unwarranted specter of child abuse in that regard;
-  organizing and insisting upon excessive child activities involving unmanageably  complex logistics invariably  conflicting  or rendering more difficult the father's parenting time with the children;
-  paying lip service to but in actuality  resisting and sabotaging therapies specifically designed to encourage family reunification  and equally involved  parenting time (Alyson  Jones);
-  multiple  reporting of 'incidents' to the police or ministry (or to others with the design of having  same so reported) in an effort to substantiate opposition to granting  or increasing the father  parenting time (the scratching incident of January  2015 being the most recent example);
-  coaching the children  for their interviews  by the Ministry  (and likely others as well);  and

-  keeping the children  informed, and indeed involved  as a witness in one instance,  of her version of the high-conflict  court proceedings thereby inducing worry  and distress designed to reinforce alignment  with the mother.

[312] Long-term alienation of a child from his or her parent can lead to significant psychological  harm of the sort described earlier in this judgment.  The conduct on the part of a parent expressly  intended to cause or perpetuate alienation is wrong and completely  unacceptable  by any standards.

[313] Quite apart from such intended design, in high-conflict  situations even young  children  can and will pick up on unconsciously  telegraphed messages, i.e. emotionless or negative expression when  speaking about the other parent, flat or negative reactions to the other parent's activities with the children,  failing to encourage the children to look forward to parenting time with the other parent, failing to remind the children of the other parent's positive attributes,  and the like. There  is little  or no evidence in this particular case regarding such  matters but it seems highly likely both parents are guilty  of same.

## Best Interests of the Children and Orders Made

[314] Section 16 of the Divorce Act addresses custody  orders and makes it mandatory for the court:

-  to consider only  the best interests of the children  as determined by reference to the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the children;
-  not to consider the past conduct of any person unless  it is relevant  to the ability of that person to act as a parent;
-  to give effect to the 'principle' that  children should  have as much  contact with each parent as is consistent  with the best interests of the children; and

-  for that purpose, to consider the willingness  of the parents to facilitate such contact.

[315]  The Family Law Act contains almost identical mandates, however,  it specifies additional considerations to be taken into account.  Sections 37 and 38 of that Act provide as follows:

## Best interests of child

- 37 (1) In  making an agreement or order under this Part respecting guardianship, parenting arrangements or contact with a child, the parties and the court must consider the best interests of the child only.
- (2) To determine what is in the best interests of a child, all of the child's needs and circumstances must be considered, including the following:
- (a) the child's health and emotional well-being;
- (b) the child's views, unless it would be inappropriate to consider them;
- (c) the nature and strength of the relationships between the child and significant persons in the child's life;
- (d) the history of the child's care;
- (e) the child's need for stability, given the child's age and stage of development;
- (f) the ability  of each person who is a guardian or seeks guardianship of the child, or who has or seeks parental responsibilities, parenting time or contact with the child, to exercise his or her responsibilities;
- (g) the impact of any family violence on the child's safety, security or well-being, whether the family violence is directed toward the child or another family member;
- (h) whether the actions of a person responsible for family violence indicate that the person may be impaired in his or her ability to care for the child and meet the child's needs;
- (i) the appropriateness of an arrangement that would require the child's guardians to cooperate on issues affecting the child, including whether requiring cooperation would increase any risks to the safety, security or well-being of the child or other family members;
- (j) any civil or criminal proceeding relevant to the child's safety, security or well-being.
- (3) An agreement or order is not in the best interests of a child unless it protects, to the greatest extent possible, the child's physical, psychological and emotional safety, security and well-being.

- (4) In making an order under this Part, a court may consider a person's conduct only if it substantially affects a factor set out in subsection (2), and only to the extent that it affects that factor.

## Assessing family  violence

- 38 For the purposes of section 37 (2) (g) and (h) [best interests of child] , a court must consider all of the following:
- (a) the nature and seriousness of the family violence;
- (b) how recently the family violence occurred;
- (c) the frequency of the family violence;
- (d) whether any psychological or emotional abuse constitutes, or is evidence of, a pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour directed at a family member;
- (e) whether the family violence was directed toward the child;
- (f) whether the child was exposed to family violence that was not directed toward the child;
- (g) the harm to the child's physical, psychological and emotional safety, security and well-being as a result of the family violence;
- (h) any steps the person responsible for the family violence has taken to prevent further family violence from occurring;
- (i) any other relevant matter.

[316] In  this case both parents are highly  educated, accomplished individuals. Both clearly  love their children  and wish to protect  and promote the children's physical and psycho-emotional  well-being.  While both parents have markedly different personalities and parenting styles,  they each bring valuable  attributes to the parenting equation which will benefit the children  both now and in the future.

[317] In  this case neither  parent would dispute the positive outcomes of secure attachments  by children  with both their mother and their father assuming both parents are well-adjusted,  capable individuals.  Neither parent would dispute that children  in such  circumstances will likely have positive self-esteem,  greater social competence and peer relationships,  and enhanced  maturity  to cope with difficult  life situations in the future.

[318] The difficulty  in the present case arises from the antipathy  each parent bears towards the other and the alienation from the father  of the two older children.  The overarching  question is how to best address the circumstances  in the best interests

of all five children and in a manner that will protect and promote their long-term psycho-emotional  development  and well-being.

[319] To a large extent,  the court has already addressed the question; in addition to ordering joint guardianship,  it has also adopted the key recommendations  made by Dr. Meuser in his s. 211 report. In  particular,  the court has:

-  ordered the parents and the older children  to participate in a treatment program geared towards resolution  of the alienation problem (Alyson Jones);
-  required the parents to follow the reasonable recommendations  made by the therapists in that  program; and
-  provided for equal parenting time on a week-on, week-off basis for all the children.

[320] The more pointed question is whether  these measures have been successful and, if not, what is now to be done in the circumstances.

[321] The father says the Alyson  Jones program has not been successful,  that the mother continues  to engage in alienating behaviours  designed to frustrate  any relationship with his daughters,  and that  accordingly more drastic measures are required. He seeks to terminate the Alyson  Jones program and instead implement one of the two other programs advocated by Dr. Meuser,  namely,  Dr. Reay's 'Family Reflections  Reunification  Program' in the Okanagan  or the 'family  bridges' program developed by Drs. Rand and Warshak in the USA. He has made inquiries with both programs and both are available, although  Dr. Reay's program may not have room until  August of this year.

[322] In  my view, it is premature to adopt the more drastic options at this time. I  agree with the observations at trial of both Dr. Meuser and Alyson  Jones that the most significant obstacle to progress to date lies with the mother's failure to genuinely  participate and to promote similar participation by the children.

Rather than  simply abandoning the Jones initiative altogether,  however,  I prefer to give it 'one last chance'  in combination with conduct  orders designed to induce more meaningful  participation which will be monitored and evaluated within  a specified time frame.

[323] In  my view, many of the problems encountered  by the parties are caused by the hectic schedule of activities, the logistics of which  are far too challenging.  They must be severely  curtailed,  not only because they  are not affordable in the parent's current  financial circumstances,  but also because it will free up time for both parents and children  to better participate in the  Alyson Jones program, whether  through electronic or in-person attendance as the case may be.

[324] The mother seems to respect discipline and order. I intend to impose both at this time. During final submissions the mother was bluntly  challenged  by the Court whether  she would comply with a 'last chance order' of the sort proposed as an alternative  to the complete removal  of her parenting time required by the more drastic alternatives  proposed by the father.  She assured the Court that she would comply.  We will see.

[325] I  have authored  these admittedly  lengthy  reasons not just for the benefit of the parties but also for the consumption  of their therapists and counsellors.  The children  may react negatively,  at least initially,  to the cancellation  of activities which they  appear to enjoy,  particularly  sailing. They  presumably  are not aware of their parent's financial  distress and they  may well need assistance in coming to understand  why the curtailment  of activities is not only  necessary but may also be healthy  and beneficial for them in the long run.

[326] The parents too will likely require supportive counselling  from their respective therapists with respect to this outcome. The father  is going to be severely disappointed by the refusal  to immediately adopt a more drastic approach to reunification.  He will need support and encouragement  to persist in the Alyson Jones program.

[327] The mother needs assistance and support in the 'attitude adjustment' referred to earlier in these reasons. She must understand  that the father is not a child abuser and that he has many good qualities to offer his children.  She must  be supportive of the father and encourage the children  to look forward to their parenting time with him. She too will need assistance in understanding  why curtailment  of the children's activities at the present time is in their best long-term  interest.  She may well need support in accepting the curtailments  of her own professional activities necessary to fully  and genuinely  participate in the Alyson  Jones program. And ultimately,  she must recognize the role her behaviour  has played in the alienation  of the elder children from their father  and she must do everything  in her power to ensure the Alyson  Jones program succeeds.

[328] I  might add that, along with Dr. Burima and the mother, I have some concern about the possibly non-therapeutic  effect of having young  children  express their criticisms of their parents in a group setting that includes the parents themselves. I  am not prepared to endorse separate, completely  confidential counselling  for the two children  at this time (although  I note it is a feature of the two other programs) but I leave to Ms. Jones any adjustments  that may be required in that regard.

[329] In  the result,  I make the following parenting  order:

1. The parties shall share joint custody  and shall remain joint guardians of the children;
2. The parties and the two eldest children shall  continue  full  participation in the Alyson Jones reunification  program and will adjust their respective work and personal schedules to fully  and effectively accommodate same;
3. The parties will comply with all directions and treatment recommendations made by the therapists in the Alyson Jones reunification  program, including  any 'rules  of engagement' promulgated by same;

4. In  the event  the reunification  goals of the program for these parties have not been accomplished within  six months  of the date of these reasons, then Ms. Jones will prepare a written  report for both the parties and the Court describing the parties' participation and progress in the program to that  date, explaining why  further  progress has not been achieved, and setting out future  parenting and treatment recommendations considered appropriate for the future  protection and promotion of the children's psycho-emotional  well-being  and development;
5. The costs of the continued  participation in the  Alyson Jones program shall be paid by the parties in the same manner  as has been the case to date and the cost of the said six months'  report will be paid equally by the parties;
6. Following preparation and receipt of the said report from Alyson  Jones, the parties will re-attend before the Court for a review and reconsideration of the parenting  regime prescribed herein;
7. Subject to any temporary variations that  may be agreed in writing directly between the parties and/or any refinements  that  might be directed by the Alyson  Jones program for the purposes of treatment within that  program, each parent will have equal parenting  time in accordance with the regime presently  in place;
8. Each parent shall have the day-to-day  care, control  and supervision and shall  make all day-to-day  decisions affecting the children during their respective parenting time;
9. Each parent is permitted to travel with the children,  both inside and outside the Province of British Columbia, during their respective parenting time, however  each parent will ensure such  travel time commences and concludes within their respective parenting time

unless  the other parent agrees otherwise by way of written communication directly between the parties;

10. For so long as the children remain in Glenlyon  Norfolk School (GNS) each child shall be permitted to engage in only  one non-school, extracurricular  recreational activity to be selected by the child in combination with both parents and the Alyson Jones program as the latter recommends. The said activity  will not include sailing and both parents will, as soon as is reasonably  possible, relinquish  and terminate the memberships of themselves  and the children  in the Victoria Yacht  Club;
11. Both parents must each inform the other beforehand  of all travel and extracurricular  activity contemplated  during their respective parenting times including,  but not necessarily  limited to, inputting  all necessary information  in the Google calendar shared by them;
12. Unless the parents agree otherwise in writing directly between themselves,  the children's passports shall  be deposited in the custody and control  of Ms. Jacqueline Horton,  barrister and solicitor, who is hereby authorized  to deliver same to either parent as shortly  as reasonably  possible before any travel  requiring such  passports and to whom the said passports will be returned  forthwith  upon  the completion of the travel  and the return  of the children to Victoria;
13. The parents must discuss and in utmost good faith attempt to reach agreement on all significant decisions regarding medical or other health-related  treatment  (except in emergency  situations),  but failing such agreement the mother is empowered to make the said decision(s). This power does not extend to any counselling  for the children  for so long as the parties are participating in the Alyson  Jones program;

14. Subject to any refinement  directed by the Alyson  Jones program in furtherance  of the treatment  pursuant  to that program, and also except in cases of emergency,  the parents shall not communicate in any way with the children when  they  are having  parenting time with the other parent. This prohibition extends  to and includes responses to any text messages or other form of communication  from the children during the said parenting time;
15. The mother shall  take scrupulous  care to ensure the children know she does not oppose and, indeed, that she supports the children's parenting time with the father. She shall  take all reasonable steps to encourage the children's relationship with the father and to influence all third parties to do likewise;
16. The parents shall not query the children  about the activities of the other parent and shall each respect the privacy rights of the other parent;
17. The parents shall not directly or indirectly discuss this matrimonial litigation with the children nor make or convey  any  negative or disparaging comments about one another  to the children  or in their presence. The parties shall  keep copies of this judgment  in a safe place that cannot be accessed by the children and shall  not show same to the children  by any means; and
18. The parties will not directly or indirectly make disparaging remarks about the other to third parties. For clarity and by way of example,  the father will not advise or suggest to other persons that the mother is in any way violent,  aggressive or mentally  ill, and the mother  will not advise or suggest to other persons that the father is in any way violent  or abusive to herself or the children.

## CHILD SUPPORT

[330] In Bennett v. Bennett , 2015 BCSC 699, I had occasion to set out for the benefit of an unrepresented  party a simple and non-exhaustive  summary  of basic legal principles applicable to the awarding of child support by the courts. In  this case, the unrepresented  mother  is an intelligent,  sophisticated individual  who likely has a better understanding  of the issues than the unrepresented  parent in the Bennett case. Nonetheless  it may be helpful  for both parties if I repeat the Bennett summary here:

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CHILD SUPPORT

...

## Obligation to Pay Child Support

- [40] Three fundamental principles apply to all child support applications:
1. parents have a joint and ongoing legal obligation to support their children;
2. it is the children, not the custodial parent, who have the right to support; and
3. support payments are based on earning capacity and not just on what a parent actually earns; as a result, a parent has a legal obligation to earn as much as he or she is reasonably capable of earning so the children can receive an appropriate level of support.
- [41] The court has jurisdiction under both the federal Divorce Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.), and the provincial Family Law Act , S.B.C. 2011, c. 25, to award support. Subject to certain exceptions, both Acts require that the amount of child support in any given case be governed by the Guidelines . These Guidelines are regulations which have been made under the Divorce Act . They include tables setting the amount of child support based on the incomes of the parents. They also provide for payment of 'special or extraordinary expenses', undue hardship, variation of support orders, how a parent's income is determined, imputation of income in certain circumstances, and exchange of financial information.

...

- [43] The court can issue orders requiring the payment of child support prospectively or retroactively. It also has the power to vary, rescind or suspend orders that have already been made, although the circumstances warranting any variation will be governed by the Guidelines .
- [44] When exercising its discretion to make a retroactive child support order, the court will consider various factors including:

-  the circumstances surrounding any delay in seeking a court order for support;
-  whether the parent has engaged in blameworthy conduct;
-  the past and present circumstances of the children, including their needs and standard of living; and
-  whether any hardship would be caused by a retroactive award.

[45] Generally speaking, the child support obligation fluctuates with the level of income available to the parents. The latter have an obligation to support their children in a way that is commensurate with their income. A payor parent who does not increase child support payments to correspond with increased income does not fulfill his or her obligation to the children.

- [46] Parents are obliged to fully and honestly disclose income information and documentation. At a minimum, this includes tax returns, notices of assessment/reassessment, statements of earnings, financial statements for self-employment, partnership or incorporated enterprises, and the like. Failure to provide disclosure can result in adverse inferences against, and the imputation of income to, the non-disclosing parent as the court considers appropriate.

## Determining Income

- [47] The Guidelines set out specific procedures to determine the annual income of a parent. The starting point is the parent's 'total income' disclosed in his or her income tax return. Schedule III  of the Guidelines then sets out various adjustments that can be made to that figure, whether as deductions or add-backs.
- [48] If there has been fluctuation in income or non-recurring receipts/expenses in the previous three years such that the number referred to above might not be the fairest determination of a parent's income, the court has a discretion to determine an annual amount that would be fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
- [49] Where a parent is a shareholder, director or officer of a corporation and the court is of the opinion that the parent's annual income set out on his or her tax return does not fairly reflect all the money available to that person for the payment of child support, the court has the discretion to include all or part of the corporation's pre-tax income in the analysis. Unreasonable payments or benefits paid to 'non-arm's-length' persons dealing with the corporation can be added back to that pre-tax income.
- [50] Lastly, the court has the ability to impute income to a parent in a wide variety of circumstances. These include such things as intentional underemployment or unemployment, diversion of income to affect the level of child support, unreasonable deduction of expenses, failure to provide income information, and the like.

## Determining Quantum in Shared Custody Cases

- [51] Very often one parent will have custody of the children for most of the time. In such situations, the focus is on the income of the other 'payor' parent

and the amount he or she is required to pay to the 'custodial' parent in accordance with the Guidelines .

[52] In cases of 'split custody' where each parent has custody of one or more children, the amount of a child support order is the difference between the amount each parent would otherwise pay if a child support order was sought against each of the parents (s. 8 of the Guidelines ).

[53] Sometimes parents have 'shared custody', which is defined by s. 9 of the Guidelines to mean each parent having access to/custody of a child for at least 40% of the time over the course of a year. This is the situation in the present case, i.e. shared custody. In such cases. s. 9 of the Guidelines requires any child support order to take into account:

- (a) the amount set out in the applicable Guideline tables for each of the parents (i.e., essentially determining a 'set-off' figure);
- (b) the increased cost of shared custody arrangements; and
- (c) the conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse and of any child for whom support is sought.

[54] These factors emphasize flexibility  and fairness. The 'set-off' of each parent's income is simply a starting point and is not the end of the inquiry. The factors identified in (b) and (c) are equally important elements. They provide flexibility  to ensure that the economic reality and particular circumstances of each family are accounted for and that the level of child support is fair.

[55] The words 'conditions, means, needs and other circumstances' import expansive inquiry. ...

[56] The 'basic' or 'table' amount of support under the Guidelines is designed to provide contribution towards basic expenses for children such as food, housing, transportation, clothing, personal care, allowances, and vacation. However, the court also has the power to provide additional support amounts to cover certain identified 'special or extraordinary expenses'.

[57] 'Special' expenses include things like necessary childcare, healthcare costs, and post-secondary education.

[58] Section 7 of the Guidelines also identifies two types of 'extraordinary expenses'. One category is for primary/secondary school education or for any other educational programs that meet the children's particular needs. The other is for 'extracurricular activities'.

[59] The term 'extraordinary expense' is defined by the Guidelines . It includes expenses which the parent cannot reasonably cover having regard to his or her income and the basic child support payment. It also includes other expenses appropriate to such things as the special needs and talents of the children, the nature of the program/activities, overall cost, and the like.

[60] There are two overriding factors to be considered in determining whether an expense qualifies for additional support under s. 7 of the Guidelines , namely, that the expense be:

1. necessary in relation to the child's best interests; and
2. reasonable in relation to the means of the parents and to the family's spending pattern before separation.

[61] With respect to all such special or extraordinary expenses, the general guiding principle is that they are to be shared by the parents in proportion to their respective incomes after deducting any contribution from the child.

## Mother's Income

[331] As a pediatric surgeon  the mother  is a self-employed  professional. She receives gross income paid by the government  under  the MSP regime. This amount is reflected on the 'Statement  of Business or Professional Activities' form attached to her annual  income tax returns.  She then  deducts various business expenses,  also particularized  on the said Statement,  to arrive at an annual  net professional income which is then  transferred  to the 'total income' page of the tax return.  The line 150 total income for the year includes the net professional income as well as any  other taxable income derived from other sources.

[332] The following  chart sets out the mother's gross professional income, net professional income and line 150 income reflected in her income tax returns  for the years 2011-2014 (it should  be noted that in 2013, the mother declared bankruptcy and as a consequence filed a pre-bankruptcy  and a post-bankruptcy  tax return  for that year):

|      | GROSS    | NET      | L150     |
|------|----------|----------|----------|
| 2011 | $227,898 | $138,388 | $141,008 |
| 2012 | $249,503 | $114,504 | $121,635 |
| 2013 | $275,251 | $175,336 | $181,041 |
| 2014 | $243,694 | $115,385 | $124,790 |

[333] As indicated above, s. 19 of the Child Support Guidelines permits the court to impute additional income to any  spouse who 'unreasonably  deducts expenses'.  In that regard reasonableness of any particular  expense deduction is not governed solely by its permissibility under  the Income Tax Act . Reasonableness  must be based on a sound evidentiary  foundation: Egan v. Egan , 2002 BCCA 275.

[334] The father claims that the mother's income for child and spousal support purposes should  be set at a minimum of $160,000 per annum.  In  support of this position the father  points out:

-  the mother's average line 150 income for the last three years is $142,500;
-  the various expenses that are deducted are excessive including  office expenses ($17,000), professional fees ($27,000), travel  ($9,500) and motor vehicle  ($17,500).

[335] The mother says her gross income is fairly stable in the $240,000-$250,000 range and that the year 2013 was unusual.  She says her expenses are 'vetted'  not only  by the tax department but also by her own accountant  and the trustee in bankruptcy  to whom she is required to submit monthly  accountings.  It  is, she says, this latter requirement  which  has increased the professional fee expense in the year 2014.

[336] In  the circumstances,  a fair amount  of annual Guideline income to be allocated to the mother for child and spousal support purposes in this case is $130,000. This accounts  for the extraordinary  nature of the professional fee expense and also claws back a relatively  modest amount for the personal use component  of some of the other expenses.

## Father's Income

[337] The simple fact of the matter is that for the past three years the father has had zero income except for universal  childcare benefits of $2,500 in 2012 and income assistance ('welfare')  in the amount  of $11,500 in 2013. The  question is what amount of income, if any,  should be imputed to the father  on account of him being 'intentionally  under-employed  or unemployed'  within the meaning of s. 19(1)(a) of the Child Support Guidelines .

[338] This section does not import any requirement  of bad faith. A parent will be considered intentionally  under-employed  or unemployed  if that parent is earning less

than  he or she is capable of earning having  regard to his or her age, education, experience, skills and health,  as well as availability of work, ability to relocate, and the like.

[339] The father is 53 years old. There is no evidence of any  health  problems on his part. He is extremely  well-educated  and has both qualifications and work experience that would ordinarily  indicate an ability to be employed in the banking or financial industries. He has expertise in construction  and property development  projects. He formerly  earned significant amounts  of money both from his employment  at Riverdale International  Inc.  as well as his own property development  portfolio.

[340] It  is apparent that the father has maintained a relationship with persons formerly  associated with Riverdale International.  His form F8 financial  statement filed December 22, 2014 attaches a September 10, 2013 letter from Mr. Jaafar Jalabi, the principal of an enterprise headquartered in Madrid, Spain and called 'Parcelatoria de Gonzalo  Chacon, S.A.'. That letter says that the enterprise ('PGC') has 'retained the services of [the father]  to secure financing for our East Harlem project located in New York City, USA' for which he is to be paid a 1% commission fee based on securing an acceptable loan commitment for the project from a bank or other finance entity.  Mr. Jalabi has paid for all expenses associated with flying  the father back and forth to New York for the purposes of that undertaking  which,  according to the father, did not come to fruition.

[341] It  is also apparent that the father has prepared or assisted in the preparation of 'final accounting'  documents  in respect of a 'HY  Realty  and PGC Service NY1' project in the fall 2014. Indeed, according to documents  put into evidence at trial, it appears that the father even had an email address with PGC ('[grg]@parscelatoria.com').

[342] In  his submissions, counsel for the father  was careful  to say that for the year 2014, the father  'reported having  no income for that year'.  However,  there is simply no evidence before the Court which contradicts the father's testimony  that he has received no income from PGC or indeed any other source in 2014-15.

[343] The evidence of both the father and his mother is to the effect that  he has been borrowing monies from family  and friends to meet his ongoing household expenses as well as to pay his costs of the Alyson Jones therapy and his legal fees. The amount provided to him by his mother to date is in excess of $150,000.

[344] In  his affidavit sworn January  26, 2015 and filed the next  day for the purposes of one of the various  court applications in this case, the father  stated that, among other things,  (paraphrasing except where indicated otherwise):

-  Dexter International  ceased to exist in 2010, at which time he was working for his wife for a period of time;
-  the New York  'opportunity'  … 'fell  apart because of [the]  unresolved  litigation' between himself and his wife;
-  he has 'searched for many  opportunities locally  and cannot  find anything despite multiple  interviews'  (no meaningful  details were supplied either in the affidavit or at trial) and that 'the counsellors  at GT Hiring Solutions have suggested [he] look for simpler employment  such as a wage earner';
-  he is 'confident  I could find some sort of shift work' 'but I would be unable  to commit to any set work schedule  until the issues between myself  and [the mother]  are resolved'  .... Given his circumstances  he would 'estimate that I  would be able to earn approximately  $25,000 per year';  and that
-  'PGC really  wanted me to work with them and I have known  them for a long time', indeed their earlier offer of an opportunity  for work in Spain 'may come available in the future  but they  [PGC] wish the ongoing family litigation to be resolved prior to committing to any type of business going forward'.

[345] It  is clear from the father's own evidence that he can find some sort of employment  which would earn at least $25,000 a year.  On the last day of evidence at trial he stated he had been looking for employment  for 'quite a bit since 2012' and he readily acknowledged he 'could work in Subway or Starbucks as a manager'.

[346] The court will not sanction  the refusal  of a parent to earn income capable of supporting his or her children  simply because the work is not sufficiently  interesting or highly  paid. The reality here is that the father could be employed at the present time and most probably could have been employed in the past couple years but for his focus on this litigation and his attempts to preserve later opportunities  with PGC.

[347] In  submissions, counsel advised that the annual  income for a Starbucks manager is in the vicinity  of $35,000-$36,000.

[348] For present purposes and having regard to all of the circumstances,  it is appropriate and fair to impute Guideline income to the father  in the amount  of $40,000. This represents  managerial/finance  work whether  as employee or selfemployed contractor.  I should also add that  the Court considers it very  likely that the father could obtain higher-end  employment  at some point in time in the future  and fully  expects that he will be diligent in pursuing  same.

## Amount of Child Support

[349] Calculations  pursuant  to the Child Support Guidelines based on the adjusted/imputed  incomes for both the father and the mother generate a child support obligation which sees the mother pay $2,140 to the father per month. I  therefore order the mother to pay to the father the sum of $2,140 commencing July  1, 2015 and on the first day of every  month  thereafter.

- [350] There remains the question whether  in addition to the monthly  child support amount awarded above, any further  amount  should  be payable as between the parents to cover all or any  portion of the special or extraordinary  expenses of the sort referred to and defined in s. 7 of the Child Support Guidelines .
- [351] It  must be remembered that provision will only  be made for these sorts of expenses if they  are:
1. necessary in relation to the child's best interests;  and
2. reasonable in relation to the means of the parents.

[352] The father does incur some modest childcare expenses in respect of the former family nanny  but these are not incurred as a result of any employment, illness or disability on his part. Otherwise,  he is not paying for, and has not made any payments in the past several years for, any of the children's health-related expenses, education expenses or extracurricular  activities. All of these latter sums have been paid by the mother since separation.

[353] The mother's F8 financial statement  indicates the special or extraordinary expenses for the five children  are in the annual  amount  of $97,500. This includes approximately  $50,000 for the costs of the children's attendance at GNS, a figure that is net of bursary and scholarships.  The luxury  of private school education is something this family cannot realistically  afford and, indeed, the mother has testified that the costs are funded  with the assistance of her parents.

[354] I  cannot,  and do not, make any orders requiring the mother's parents to continue  funding  their grandchildren's  private education. If  they wish to do so, that is most generous of them but it does not result  in any 'credit' which  operates in favour of the mother  for the purposes of child or spousal support 'accounting'  in this litigation. If that support is withdrawn,  the simple reality is that  the children  will have to attend public school.

[355] The extraordinary  expenses claimed by the mother also include significant counselling  costs incurred  in respect of the attendance  by S. and T. in the Alyson Jones program. These are expenses which  are reasonably  incurred for the welfare of the children  and from this point forward, they  should  be shared by the parents pro rata to the Guideline incomes determined above.

[356] The remaining significant expenses claimed by the mother relate to extracurricular  activities. I have already  determined that continuation  of the sailing activities by the children must  stop so that the family  can focus on reunification therapy  with Alyson Jones. In  any event,  the expenses associated with sailing are unrealistic  and unreasonable  in light of the parties' current  financial situation.

[357] The girls are all involved  in ballet and sailing. I have already determined that their extracurricular  activities should  be limited to one activity per child per season with no overlap.  This direction was made not only  to improve logistics to facilitate therapy  but also to increase the time for personal interaction  between the children and their parents, particularly  the father. The ballet is more expensive  than soccer but the costs are sufficiently  modest that,  should the children elect to continue  with one activity  or the other, then  the expenses of same should  be shared between the parents pro rata to the Guideline incomes determined above.

[358] Since the Alyson  Jones program review may result  in significant changes to the custody and parenting  regime for the children,  the child support orders set out above shall also be reviewed at the same time and any necessary  adjustments made.

## Retroactivity

[359] Parenting time of the children  has been equally  shared by the mother and father since the court order to that effect made July  4, 2014. The father therefore seeks to have the child support payments  retroactive to that date. That  sum would be a little over $25,000, an amount  which the father says the mother  has the ability to pay notwithstanding  her bankruptcy  by virtue  of her RRSP valued  at approximately  $140,000.

[360] In  my opinion, a retroactive  award is neither warranted  nor fair. The mother has paid a disproportionate amount of the children's expenses for many  years, a sum that far exceeds the amount  now claimed on a retroactive basis. It would  be inequitable for a retroactive  obligation to be imposed upon her in such circumstances.

[361] Further,  I prefer that the RRSP be available should  it be required to fund the cost of the expenses associated with continued  participation in the Alyson  Jones reunification  program.

[362] The husband's claim for a retroactive child support order is therefore dismissed.

## SPOUSAL SUPPORT

[363] The husband seeks an order for spousal support pursuant  to s. 15.2 of the Divorce Act , including retroactive  support from March 1, 2013, being approximately one month following  the date the mother moved from the former family  residence with the children.

[364] In Gisler v. Gisler , 2015 BCSC 323, both parties were represented by counsel but because neither client was financially  sophisticated I reviewed some basic principles underlying  entitlement  to and calculation  of spousal support for their benefit. I will repeat them here since, although  the parties in this case are sophisticated, one of them is unrepresented  by counsel  and so the explanation may be helpful  to her understanding  of the outcome:

## BASIC PRINCIPLES OF SPOUSAL SUPPORT

...

- [54] Spousal support is a creature of statute: both the Divorce Act [section 15.2] and the Family Law Act [part 7, division 4] empower the court to require one spouse to pay support monies to the other. Both statutes leave a broad discretion to judges in individual cases for all three dimensions of spousal support, namely: (1) entitlement, (2) duration, and (3) amount.
- [55] The threshold question is entitlement. This is determined with reference to certain 'objectives' set out in both statutes in almost identical language. Both statutes mandate that these objectives be taken into account. The objectives include:
3.  recognition of any economic advantages or disadvantages to the spouses arising from the relationship between them or its breakdown;
4.  apportionment between the spouses of any financial consequences arising from the care of their children, beyond the duty to provide support for the children;
5.  relieving any economic hardship of the spouses arising from the breakdown of their relationship; and
6.  as far as practicable, promoting the economic self-sufficiency of each spouse within a reasonable period of time.
- [56] The leading decisions from the Supreme Court of Canada dealing with this subject have articulated three separate bases for entitlement to

spousal support: compensatory, non-compensatory, and contractual support: Moge v. Moge , [1992] 3 S.C.R. 813 (compensatory support); Bracklow v. Bracklow , [1999] 1 S.C.R. 420 (non-compensatory support); and Miglin v. Miglin , 2003 SCC 24 (contractual support).

[57] Compensatory principles address the contributions of a spouse to the relationship and the spouse's losses upon its breakdown. The classic application, although by no means the only one, arises in relationships where one spouse did not pursue employment outside the home in order to care for the children. The end of that relationship places the spouse at an economic disadvantage, which compensatory support should address ('foregone careers and missed opportunities': Bracklow ).

- [58] Non-compensatory principles address the needs of a spouse after the breakdown of the relationship. This kind of support arises out of the relationship itself and is based on the social obligation of a spouse to look after a former partner who is in difficulty, rather than letting that burden fall upon the public.
- [59] Self-sufficiency is only one objective, and is only a goal 'insofar as practicable'. In determining what is practicable, the court will consider all circumstances, including the recipient spouse's age, gender, skills, education, opportunity for retraining, and the realistic prospect of the spouse finding a job that enables him or her to become self-sufficient: Tedham v. Tedham , 2005 BCCA 502.
- [60] However, no one principle or set of objectives dominates the analysis. A court should balance the various relevant factors and strike the balance that best achieves justice in the particular case. This is a highly fact-specific exercise in each case.
- [61] Marriage alone does not automatically entitle a spouse to support upon its dissolution. Further, no single statutory objective is paramount, so both the compensatory and non-compensatory grounds can be used to justify entitlement. Generally speaking, however, any significant disparity in incomes [*or standards of living] at the end of a marriage or relationship will usually give rise to an entitlement to some spousal support for some period of time.
- [62] The leading case law referred to above addressed only entitlement and not the more mundane and difficult issues of amount and duration with which the trial courts are called upon to grapple on a daily basis.
- [63] Under the Family Law Act , if entitlement to spousal support is established having regard to the objectives set forth above, then s. 160 of the Act makes it mandatory for the other spouse to provide support. The amount and duration of that support must then be determined on a consideration of the conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse including the three circumstances specifically identified in s. 162 of the Act . These circumstances are identical to the three 'factors' also specified as mandatory considerations under s. 15(4) of the Divorce Act and include:
7.  the length of time the spouses live together;
8.  the functions performed by each spouse during the period they lived together; and

-  any agreement between the parties or any order relating to the support of either spouse.

[64] Spousal misconduct is not a factor to be considered in awarding spousal support except to the extent conduct arbitrarily or unreasonably (a) causes, prolongs or aggravates the need for spousal support, or (b) affects the ability to provide spousal support [s. 166, FLA ].

[65] In practice, the Federal Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines released by the Federal Department of Justice are usually applied in most cases to determine the amount and duration of spousal support, whether under the Divorce Act or as a 'useful tool' under the Family Law Act . While these Guidelines are only 'advisory' in nature, British Columbia is one of the provinces which has strongly endorsed their use: Yemchuk v. Yemchuk , 2005 BCCA 406, Chutter v. Chutter , 2008 BCCA 507.

- [66] The Guidelines provide two basic formulas for determining the amount and duration of spousal support. The first is the 'without child support formula' and the second is the 'with child support formula'. As the names suggest, the dividing line between the two is the absence or presence of a dependent child and a concurrent child support obligation at the time spousal support is determined.

[67] Both formulas use income sharing as the method for determining the amount of spousal support. The formulas then produce ranges for the amount and duration of support, not just a single number. The precise number chosen within that range will be determined by the court depending upon the facts of any particular case.

[68] The starting point under both formulas is the definition of income used in the Federal Child Support Guidelines . Generally speaking a spouse's annual income is determined using the sources of income set out under the heading 'total income' and aggregated on line 150 of an individual's income tax return. The Guidelines also specify certain adjustments which can then be taken into account. ...

- [69] Finally,  the Guidelines provide for the concept of imputing income to a spouse in a wide variety of appropriate circumstances including such things as:
2.  a spouse being intentionally underemployed or unemployed;
3.  diversion of income;
4.  tax exemptions;
5.  unreasonable deduction of expenses from income;
6.  failing  to reasonably utilize property to generate income; and
7.  failing  to provide income information when under a legal obligation to do so.

[*added at this time]

[365] In  closing argument,  counsel for the father advised that  entitlement  to spousal support in this case is based solely  upon need and that there is no compensatory element to the claim.

[366] As discussed above, the father currently  has zero income and has received no financial support from the mother.  He has been unemployed  during that time and has relied on assistance from family and friends to support himself.

[367] While I have  found that the father was and is capable of employment  and have imputed income to him accordingly,  the fact of the matter is that he is not yet employed and has no money to support himself. In  the circumstances  a needsbased claim for spousal support from the wife must succeed.

[368] Based on the Guideline incomes determined above, the formula set out in the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines results  in spousal support payable by the mother to the father ranging from a low of zero to a high of $1,416 with the midway point being $1,055.

[369] In  my view, the mid-range number is a fair outcome in the circumstances  and no further  adjustments  are required. Accordingly the mother will pay the father the sum of $1,055 per month  commencing  July  1, 2015. The claim for spousal support on a retroactive basis is dismissed on the same grounds as the claim for retroactive child support.

[370] Since it is my intention  to review the progress of the reunification  counselling program in six months' time and since it is my expectation  that the husband will secure some sort of appropriate employment  within that  time period, I also direct that the issue of spousal support and the husband's employment  search/status  be reviewed no earlier than six months  from the date of these reasons but to coincide with the said Alyson  Jones program review directed above.

## OUTSTANDING CONTEMPT APPLICATIONS

[371] Earlier court orders adjourned to the trial of this case consideration of the parties' applications to have each other held in contempt for non-compliance  with previous directions of the court.  While I do not in any way condone or minimize any such non-compliance  and will deal severely  with any non-compliance  with the orders made at the present time, I nonetheless  prefer to focus both the court and the parties on the immediate future  including,  most particularly,  the continued  family reunification  therapy  at the Alyson  Jones program. For these reasons, any outstanding  contempt  applications between the parties are dismissed without  costs.

## CONCLUSION

[372] For ease of reference I repeat here the orders that that  are being made by the Court at this time:

## Divorce

1. Subject to s. 12 of the Divorce Act , the parties are granted a divorce to take effect on the 31 st day following  the date of this judgment;

## Custody, Access, Guardianship and Parenting

2. The parties shall share joint custody  and shall remain joint guardians of the children;
3. The parties and the two eldest children shall  continue  full  participation in the Alyson Jones reunification  program and will adjust their respective work and personal schedules to fully  and effectively accommodate same;
4. The parties will comply with all directions and treatment recommendations made by the therapists in the Alyson Jones reunification  program, including  any 'rules  of engagement' promulgated by same;

5. In  the event  the reunification  goals of the program for these parties have not been accomplished within  six months  of the date of these reasons, then Ms. Jones will prepare a written  report for both the parties and the Court describing the parties' participation and progress in the program to that  date, explaining why  further  progress has not been achieved, and setting out future  parenting and treatment recommendations considered appropriate for the future  protection and promotion of the children's psycho-emotional  well-being  and development;
6. The costs of the continued  participation in the  Alyson Jones program shall be paid by the parties in the same manner  as has been the case to date and the cost of the said six months'  report will be paid equally by the parties;
7. Following preparation and receipt of the said report from Alyson  Jones, the parties will re-attend before the Court for a review and reconsideration of the parenting  regime prescribed herein;
8. Subject to any temporary variations that  may be agreed in writing directly between the parties and/or any refinements  that  might be directed by the Alyson  Jones program for the purposes of treatment within that  program, each parent will have equal parenting  time in accordance with the regime presently  in place;
9. Each parent shall have the day-to-day  care, control  and supervision and shall  make all day-to-day  decisions affecting the children during their respective parenting time;
10. Each parent is permitted to travel with the children,  both inside and outside the Province of British Columbia, during their respective parenting time, however  each parent will ensure such  travel time commences and concludes within their respective parenting time

unless  the other parent agrees otherwise by way of written communication directly between the parties;

11. For so long as the children remain in Glenlyon  Norfolk School (GNS) each child shall be permitted to engage in only  one non-school, extracurricular  recreational activity to be selected by the child in combination with both parents and the Alyson Jones program as the latter recommends. The said activity  will not include sailing and both parents will, as soon as is reasonably  possible, relinquish  and terminate the memberships of themselves  and the children  in the Victoria Yacht  Club;
12. Both parents must each inform the other beforehand  of all travel and extracurricular  activity contemplated  during their respective parenting times including,  but not necessarily  limited to, inputting  all necessary information  in the Google calendar shared by them;
13. Unless the parents agree otherwise in writing directly between themselves,  the children's passports shall  be deposited in the custody and control  of Ms. Jacqueline Horton,  barrister and solicitor, who is hereby authorized  to deliver same to either parent as shortly  as reasonably  possible before any travel  requiring such  passports and to whom the said passports will be returned  forthwith  upon  the completion of the travel  and the return  of the children to Victoria;
14. The parents must discuss and in utmost good faith attempt to reach agreement on all significant decisions regarding medical or other health-related  treatment  (except in emergency  situations),  but failing such agreement the mother is empowered to make the said decision(s). This power does not extend to any counselling  for the children  for so long as the parties are participating in the Alyson  Jones program;

15. Subject to any refinement  directed by the Alyson  Jones program in furtherance  of the treatment  pursuant  to that program, and also except in cases of emergency,  the parents shall not communicate in any way with the children when  they  are having  parenting time with the other parent. This prohibition extends  to and includes responses to any text messages or other form of communication  from the children during the said parenting time;
16. The mother shall  take scrupulous  care to ensure the children know she does not oppose and, indeed, that she supports the children's parenting time with the father. She shall  take all reasonable steps to encourage the children's relationship with the father and to influence all third parties to do likewise;
17. The parents shall not query the children  about the activities of the  other parent and shall each respect the privacy rights of the other parent;
18. The parents shall not directly or indirectly discuss this matrimonial litigation with the children nor make or convey  any  negative or disparaging comments about one another  to the children  or in their presence. The parties shall  keep copies of this judgment  in a safe place that cannot be accessed by the children and shall  not show same to the children  by any means;
19. The parties will not directly or indirectly make disparaging remarks about the other to third parties. For clarity and by way of example,  the father will not advise or suggest to other persons that the mother is in any way violent,  aggressive or mentally  ill, and the mother  will not advise or suggest to other persons that the father is in any way violent  or abusive to herself or the children.

## Support

20. The mother's annual Guideline income for child and spousal support purposes is determined to be $130,000 and the father's annual Guideline income for the same purposes is imputed to be $40,000;
21. The mother will pay the sum of $2,140 to the father  each month  as child support commencing July  1, 2015 and on the first day of every month thereafter;
22. The following  expenses qualify as special or extraordinary  expenses within the meaning of s. 7 of the Child Support Guidelines and shall  be shared by and paid for by the parents pro rata to the Guideline incomes determined above:
4.  the counselling  costs incurred in respect of the attendance by S. and T. in the Alyson  Jones program;
5.  the cost of any  one activity per child per season selected by the children in accordance with para. 11 of this order;
23. The mother will pay the father the sum of $1,055 per month commencing June 1, 2015 and on the first day of every month thereafter;
24. The claims for an award of child and spousal support on a retroactive basis are dismissed;
25. The issues of child and spousal support shall be reviewed at the same time as the review referred to in para. 7 of this order and will include a review of the husband's  employment  search/status  in the meantime;

## Miscellaneous

26. Mr. Justice Kent will remain seized of all further  applications in this case excepting only  applications involving  urgency  which  Mr. Justice Kent is not available to hear;
27. A copy of these reasons for judgment  is to be provided to all therapists and counsellors  currently  assisting the parties; and
28. Any contempt applications outstanding  between the parties at this time are dismissed.

[373] It  is the Court's hope and expectation  that both parents will take all necessary steps to immediately implement  both the messages as well as the express directions contained in this judgment.

[374] The parties once loved each other. Each recognized and appreciated the good qualities of the other. They  both now have five children  whose best interests require some level of parental reconciliation and improved cooperation in the future. Both parents can do this. I urge them to do so. This Court cannot  and will not become a surrogate parent to those children.

[375] Success has been divided. Neither party obtained the parenting relief they sought.  Support has been ordered, but not at the levels sought  and not retroactively. Both the genuineness  of the wife's compliance with family therapy  and the husband's search for employment  is subject to future  review. In  these circumstances,  no costs are awarded to either party at this time but the question of costs may be revisited in the context  of the compliance review.
