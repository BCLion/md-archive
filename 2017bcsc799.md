## INTRODUCTION

- [1] The claimant mother and respondent father lived together for more than seven years before they separated in November 2014. They  never married. They have a son who is currently  eight years old (the 'Child'). For ease of reference, I will refer to the mother as the claimant and the father as the respondent.
- [2] Following a three-week  trial, the issues to be determined involve guardianship,  parenting responsibilities, parenting time with the Child, child support, and family property  and debt division. Conduct and protection orders are also sought.
- [3] The parties have had significant conflict  since they separated. Their personal conflict has evolved to include consistent  involvement  of the Ministry  of Children and Family Development (the 'Ministry'),  the Royal Canadian Mounted  Police ('RCMP') and the courts. Parental alienation and family violence are alleged. Their accusations include claims of significant criminal behaviour.
- [4] The claimant has another  son, B.A.M., from a previous relationship.  B.A.M. is 15 years old, lives with the claimant and currently  wishes to have  no contact with the respondent.  Neither party is pursuing  any claims with respect to B.A.M.
- [5] I  will  organize these reasons as follows:  I will first make findings of fact. In  this section, following a brief word about the assessment of credibility and reliability of witnesses, I will introduce the parties, the witnesses and other relevant  persons in this trial and then outline  my detailed findings of fact. I will attempt to outline these findings in chronological order, resolving the factual disputes as they  arise in the chronology.  I will then consider each individual  issue, setting out the applicable law and applying the facts as I have  found to that law. I will conclude by summarizing  my analysis and the resulting  Orders.

## FACTS

## Credibility and Reliability

- [6] Many of my findings of fact turn  on an assessment of the credibility of the parties and other witnesses and the reliability of their evidence. The parties in particular gave conflicting  evidence about various significant events.  Where relevant to the issues to be decided in this case, I will resolve the testimonial conflict.
- [7] The Family Law Act , S.B.C. 2011, c. 25 [ FLA ], which applies to this proceeding, requires the court not to consider the conduct  of the parties, except to the extent  that it is relevant  to the parenting abilities of the parties, or affects the factors that  must be taken into account in determining the best interests  of the Child. In  this case, many aspects of the parties' conduct is relevant  to their parenting abilities and affects the factors that must be taken into account  in determining the Child's best interests.
- [8] The court's fact finding role requires an assessment of the credibility (truthfulness/honesty)  of witnesses and the reliability (accuracy)  of their evidence. This requires consideration of many  factors. Madam Justice Ker summarized  these factors in Gill Tech Framing Ltd. v. Gill , 2012 BCSC 1913 at paras. 27-28:
- [27] The factors to be considered when assessing credibility were summarized by Madam Justice Dillon in Bradshaw v. Stenner , 2010 BCSC 1398 at para. 186, as follows:

Credibility involves an assessment of the trustworthiness of a witness' testimony based upon the veracity or sincerity of a witness and the accuracy of the evidence that the witness provides ( Raymond v. Bosanquet (Township) (1919), 59 S.C.R. 452, 50 D.L.R. 560 (S.C.C.)). The art of assessment involves examination of various factors such as the ability and opportunity to observe events, the firmness of his memory, the ability to resist the influence of interest to modify his recollection, whether the witness' evidence harmonizes with independent evidence that has been accepted, whether the witness changes his testimony during direct and cross-examination, whether the witness' testimony seems unreasonable, impossible, or unlikely, whether a witness has a motive to lie, and the demeanour of a witness generally ( Wallace v. Davis (1926), 31 O.W.N. 202 (Ont. H.C.); Faryna v. Chorny , [1952] 2 D.L.R. 354 (B.C.C.A.) [ Faryna ]; R. v. S.(R.D.) , [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484 at para.128 (S.C.C.)). Ultimately, the validity  of the evidence depends on whether the evidence is

consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole and shown to be in existence at the time ( Faryna at para. 356).

[28] In assessing credibility in the face of conflicting evidence, the Nova Scotia Supreme Court in Re: Novac Estate , 2008 NSSC 283 noted the following at paras. 36 and 37:

[36] There are many tools for assessing credibility:

- a) The ability to consider inconsistencies and weaknesses in the witness's evidence, which includes internal inconsistencies, prior inconsistent statements, inconsistencies between the witness' testimony and the testimony of other witnesses.
- b) The ability to review independent evidence that confirms or contradicts the witness' testimony.
- c) The ability to assess whether the witness' testimony is plausible or, as stated by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Faryna v. Chorny , [1951] B.C.J. No. 152, 1951 CarswellBC 133, it is "in harmony with the preponderance of probabilities which a practical [and] informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions", but in doing so I am required not to rely on false or frail assumptions about human behaviour.
- d) It is possible to rely upon the demeanour of the witness, including their sincerity and use of language, but it should be done with caution ( R. v. Mah , [2002] N.S.J. No. 349, 2002 NSCA 99, paras. 70-75).
- e) Special consideration must be given to the testimony of witnesses who are parties to proceedings; it is important to consider the motive that witnesses may have to fabricate evidence. R. v. J.H. , [2005] O.J. No. 39 (Ont. C.A.), paras. 5156).

[37] There is no principle of law that requires a trier of fact to believe or disbelieve a witness's testimony in its entirety. On the contrary, a trier may believe none, part or all of a witness's evidence, and may attach different weight to different parts of a witness's evidence. (See R. v. D.R. [1996] 2 S.C.R. 291 at para. 93 and R. v. J.H., supra ).

- [9] With these general principles in mind, I will say from the outset that I have serious reservations  about the credibility of the claimant and the reliability of her evidence. As I will explain further  in these reasons, I have found that  the claimant has engaged in highly  manipulative  behaviour,  not only  with her children,  members of her family,  the respondent,  the RCMP and the Ministry,  but with the court as well. She has frequently  disobeyed Court Orders, been untruthful  in aspects of her

evidence and has been obstructionist  in her dealings with those in authority.  I found the respondent to be, in most respects, quite credible and his evidence reliable.

## Introduction to the Parties and Other Persons

## The Claimant

- [10] The claimant is 37 years old. She completed grade 12 in 1996. From 1998 to 2002, she worked at the local ski hill in a variety  of positions. B.A.M. was born in 2002. In 2006, the claimant commenced employment  at the local regional correctional centre,  first as a security officer, then as a correctional officer and now as a correctional supervisor.
- [11] The claimant currently  resides in a rental  home with B.A.M. and is in a dating relationship with someone who does not reside with them.  As a result  of proceedings in Provincial Court in the summer and fall of 2016, the claimant has no contact with the Child.
- [12] The claimant was self-represented  during this trial. She was articulate, intelligent  and well-prepared.  She was familiar with the Supreme Court Family Rules , B.C. Reg. 169/2009 [ Family Rules ] and versed in many  legal and evidentiary concepts. She conducted thorough  direct examinations  and probing crossexaminations.  She presented very able submissions utilizing  appropriate references to case authorities.  Although  she needed assistance with some procedural and other matters, she was a good advocate for herself.

## B.A.M.

- [13] B.A.M. is currently  15 years old. The claimant  has been his primary caregiver from birth, but he did enjoy  the respondent's caregiving while the parties were together.  B.A.M. has had, in recent years, regular time with his biological father,  R.P. Since April 2015, B.A.M. has refused to have contact with  the respondent.  Although he and his half-brother,  the Child, were close siblings for many  years, B.A.M. has unfortunately  refused to have any contact with the Child over the last few months. This decision was a product of his unwavering  allegiance to his mother.

- [14] Neither B.A.M. nor the Child were called upon to testify at this trial, but the parties ensured  the court  received their views and involvement  through  other evidence.

## R.P. and E.P.

- [15] R.P., a firefighter,  is B.A.M.'s biological father.  His wife, E.P., is a special education teacher. R.P. and E.P. have young  children of their own. They  have parenting time with B.A.M. When  the claimant and the respondent  were together, R.P. and E.P. spent time with them, including  caring for the Child on occasion. R.P. and E.P. currently  have a good relationship  with the claimant.  They  consider her a friend. Both R.P. and E.P. testified at this trial. I found  them both to be credible and reliable witnesses.

## N.M.

- [16] N.M. is the claimant's father. He is 58 years old and works as an industrial chemist. He and the claimant's mother  separated when  the claimant was very young.  N.M. has provided emotional and other support to the claimant since the time of separation and throughout  the trial. N.M. testified at this trial. I found  him to be a credible and reliable witness as well.

## The Respondent

- [17] The respondent  is 45 years old. He completed grade 12 in 1989. In  1991, he attended the University  College of the Cariboo where he completed a Human Worker's Certificate, specializing in correctional services. In  June of 1992, the respondent  obtained employment  with the local regional correctional  centre, starting first as a security  officer, then  a correctional officer,  and then a correctional supervisor.  In  2008, he began work as a parole officer. In 2011, he became a fulltime parole officer with the Correctional Service of Canada. He continues  to hold this employment.
- [18] The respondent  currently  resides in a rental home with the Child and is not in a relationship.

- [19] The respondent  had been married before the parties met. He and his former spouse raised three children  - two they  had together and one from his spouse's previous relationship.  He is now a grandfather.  The respondent was in the process of divorcing his former spouse when  the parties met. The  respondent maintains a good relationship with his former spouse, their children  and their children's families.

## The Ministry Employees

- [20] The Ministry  became involved  with this former family in the spring of 2015. Heather Lloyd was one of the first social workers assigned to the file. Chelan Lubin assumed conduct of the file from Ms. Lloyd at the end of August 2015.
- [21] Ms. Lubin obtained her Bachelor of Social Work in 2014. She has been employed as a social worker with the Ministry  since that  time. Another social worker, Shauna Washbrook, assisted Ms. Lubin from time to time. Dana MacKenzie was Ms. Lubin's supervisor during the relevant  times. Ms. Lubin testified and was crossexamined extensively  by the claimant. Ms. Lloyd, Ms. Washbrook and Ms. MacKenzie did not testify.
- [22] Ian  Reedman is a child and youth  mental  health  clinician. He holds a Master of Social Work. His Bachelor's degree in this field has a speciality in child welfare. Mr. Reedman has worked for the Ministry in this capacity for approximately  18 months.  Prior to this employment,  he was a clinician in the Ontario hospital system as a crisis worker.
- [23] Mr. Reedman became involved in this matter in May of 2016. He engaged with the parties initially  and subsequently  engaged in regular counselling  services with the Child. Mr. Reedman testified at this trial. I found his evidence to be fair, impartial and very  helpful.
- [24] The claimant vigorously  attacked the credibility and reliability of the evidence coming from the Ministry.  She asserted that the Ministry representatives  generally, but particularly  Ms. Lubin, were manipulated  by the respondent.  This manipulation created a bias against her in his favour.  She believes his manipulation  culminated  in

a conspiracy against her, ultimately  causing the Child to be removed from her care. The conspiracy she alleges involves  not only  the fabrication of evidence, but the provision of false testimony.  These are serious allegations.

[25] As these reasons will reveal, I find these allegations are completely  without merit. I found  all of the professional witnesses, including those employed by the Ministry,  to be fair, truthful  and accurate witnesses. Their efforts with this former family were unbiased. Any difficulties that arose between the claimant and these professionals stemmed from the claimant's attitude and conduct.

## Interior Community Services ('ICS')

[26] ICS is an organization  that provides support services and programs that address a wide variety  of needs in the community,  including  supporting and working with families in crisis. ICS accepts referrals from outside agencies such as the Ministry.  Such a referral was made in this case. ICS family support workers, Angela Pater and Andrea Ballance, were involved  with this former family.

- [27] Ms. Ballance obtained her degree in social work in 2013. She first became involved  with this matter in January  2016. She initially worked with the claimant for several months  and then  began to also work with the respondent.  Ms. Ballance testified at this trial. Ms. Pater did not.
- [28] Perhaps with less intensity  than  the challenge  to Ms. Lubin's credibility and reliability, the claimant attempted to portray  Ms. Ballance as a biased witness, generally  part of the respondent's manipulation  and overall  conspiracy against her. I find these allegations are also unfounded.  Ms. Ballance was an honest,  fair, professional and unbiased witness.  She conducted herself in these ways with this family as well. I accept her evidence as truthful  and accurate.

## Dr. Nicole Aubé

- [29] Dr. Aubé did not testify at this trial. In  July  2015, the parties consented to an Order requiring them to jointly  retain a registered psychologist or psychiatrist  for the purpose of assessing the Child's needs in relation to his care and time with each

parent and the ability and willingness  of each parent to satisfy those needs. Through their respective counsel,  the parties jointly  retained Dr. Aubé, a clinical and forensic psychologist.  The respondent  tendered her report dated April 1, 2016 (the 'Report'). The claimant takes issue with certain aspects of the Report, although  now seems to agree with Dr. Aubé's primary recommendation  for equally  shared parenting time and responsibilities. I will address those issues when  I consider the Report further  in these reasons.

## Factual Findings

- [30] These findings will, of necessity,  be lengthy.  The evidence called in this trial covered many details of the daily lives of this former family over the last four or five years, with particular emphasis upon the last three-year  period. These findings of fact do not refer to every  single event,  email or text message communication described in the evidence, only  ones relevant  to the issues I am to decide.
- [31] Four years before the paths of the parties crossed, B.A.M. was born to the claimant and R.P. The evolution  of the parenting relationship between the claimant and R.P. provides important context  to the events  that later unfolded  between the claimant and respondent.  I will take a brief moment  at the outset of these factual findings to outline  this context.
- [32] R.P. and E.P. are now at a point where they  are friends with the claimant. They  are said to be the envy  of all of their friends as an ideal model of how coparenting after separation should look. The claimant is the primary caregiver to B.A.M. and spends most time with him. They  have no set parenting  time schedule for R.P. They  enjoy some meals and holidays  together and generally  work together cooperatively.  This cooperative situation was not, however,  always the case.
- [33] The claimant did not allow R.P. to be present at B.A.M.'s birth, despite his wish to do so. She also refused his request to be identified as his father on B.A.M.'s birth certificate. For the first several years of B.A.M.'s life, the claimant controlled B.A.M.'s time with his father. At first, she refused to allow R.P. access to B.A.M. outside her residence. It took roughly  three or four years before she allowed R.P. to

take B.A.M. for overnight  visits. The two had arguments  about B.A.M., but the claimant typically  won those arguments.  R.P. came to learn that  if he 'gave in' or did not challenge  the claimant's decision-making in respect of B.A.M., even when  he found  her to be acting unreasonably,  he would be allowed more time with his son. R.P. believes that his 'kill her with kindness' approach has worked well for him because it has allowed him to be able to see his son a lot.

- [34] As will be seen, the claimant tried a similar approach with the respondent regarding the Child when the parties' relationship broke down. The respondent  did not learn to react in the same way as R.P. To the contrary,  the respondent sought equally  shared parenting responsibilities and time with the Child. Things  have not gone well.
- [35] The parties met at work in September 2006. At that  time, the claimant was living alone with B.A.M., who was then  four years old. They  lived in a condominium owned by the claimant's mother.
- [36] The respondent  moved into the claimant's residence on March 7, 2007. He quickly stepped into the role of a step-father  to B.A.M. They  lived as a family.  They shared living expenses and shared parenting responsibilities.
- [37] In  August of 2008, the Child was born. Although  each now minimizes and denigrates the role played by the other in respect of the care of the two children, household  responsibilities and other aspects of their daily lives, I am satisfied the parties generally  shared parenting responsibilities for the two children  and household  responsibilities while they were together.
- [38] The parties separated briefly from approximately  July  to October 2011. The respondent  moved out of their home during that period of time due to an inappropriate texting  relationship with a third party.
- [39] When the parties reconciled in October 2011, the family  continued to live in the condominium owned by the claimant's mother. By the summer of 2012, they decided they needed a bigger home and decided to purchase  a home together.

- [40] In  August of 2012, the parties purchased a home (the family residence). The purchase price of the family residence was approximately  $430,000.00. I  say approximately  because neither party adduced any  documentary  or other evidence relating to the purchase  of the family residence.
- [41] This brings me to the first significant source of controversy  in the evidence.
- [42] The parties had no money for a down-payment,  but still wished to purchase a home. They obtained two sources for the down-payment  - the claimant's mother and N.M. Although  the claimant's mother's advancement  of funds was not explored in the evidence, there appears to be no dispute that the funds  she advanced were a gift to them both for the purchase of the family residence. The dispute lies in N.M.'s $50,000.00 gift. N.M. gave the claimant $50,000.00 in July  2012. He says these funds  were intended as a gift for the claimant only.  The respondent  takes the position that those funds  were a gift intended for them both.
- [43] I  find the evidence of the parties themselves  to be quite vague,  but some factual  findings can ultimately  be made.
- [44] The respondent  generally  took care of the family finances,  yet his evidence in this area was uncertain  and vague.  He testified that he and N.M. were always  on friendly  terms. N.M. was aware they  needed help with the down-payment.  When he spoke to N.M. and the claimant about the funds,  the respondent  testified that N.M. always referred to 'the money he had given to us' and the claimant always referred to the funds  as 'our down-payment'  that her father was 'giving to us'. N.M. confirmed the positive nature  of their relationship,  but denied referring to the funds  in the manner suggested by the respondent.
- [45] With the money  from the claimant's parents and the respondent's good credit, the respondent testified that the parties were then  able to qualify  for a mortgage. Without  his good credit, he says they  would not have qualified. The claimant disputes this.

- [46] The respondent  did not witness the transaction where N.M.  provided the money to the claimant, but he understood  that N.M. wrote a money  order or cheque to her and that cheque or money  order was deposited in the parties' joint bank account.  The respondent  believes a portion of those funds were used for the downpayment and conveyance  costs and the remainder stayed in the joint account  and was used for family debts. The respondent adduced no banking records or other documentary  evidence to support this belief.
- [47] The claimant's evidence in this area was brief. She simply testified that her father gave her a gift of $50,000.00 and she used it as a down payment  on the house.  She provided no evidence about how, when  or where she received the funds or where the funds  specifically. She did not tender any bank records to show how the funds were handled.  As I have  indicated, there are no documents  relating to the purchase of the family residence that would even show such  basic information  as the purchase price and a down-payment  amount.  In  short,  there was no documentation  or evidence at all to show where the funds  went.  The most that can be said is that the claimant has not indicated that  she disagrees with the respondent's belief that the funds from her father  were deposited into their joint bank account.  They  do agree that at least some of those funds were used to purchase the family residence.
- [48] Fortunately,  N.M. was called to testify about this gift. I find I can rely upon his evidence to the extent  of his knowledge.
- [49] It  is the donor's intention  when  making the gift that is important.  N.M. testified that he gave $50,000.00 to his daughter toward the purchase of the family residence. He did not intend to give it to the respondent.  In  support of this stated intention,  N.M.  produced a copy of a 'gift letter' dated July  13, 2012. This letter, prepared for the Mortgage Centre, is signed by both N.M. and the claimant.  It states that N.M. 'is making a financial gift [$50,000.00] to [the  claimant] for use toward the purchase of the property located at [the family residence]'. The letter goes on to

state that N.M.  and the claimant 'hereby  certify that these funds  are a genuine gift from the Donor(s) and do not ever have to be repaid…'.

- [50] N.M. testified that he gave $50,000.00 to the claimant.  He did not know precisely where the money  went from there.
- [51] N.M. further  testified that approximately  two years later, at a time when the parties first began to have  difficulties in their relationship,  the respondent approached N.M. to discuss financial matters. In  that conversation,  the respondent asked N.M. to swear an Affidavit deposing that  the gift was also intended for him. N.M. refused to do so. He told the respondent that he was under the impression that someone from the respondent's  family was also going to give him money  too to contribute  to the down-payment.  He told the respondent  the money  he had given was a gift for his daughter.
- [52] I  accept the evidence of N.M. that he intended to make a gift, without consideration or expectation  of remuneration,  to his daughter  only.  I accept that the claimant accepted this gift and N.M. delivered it to her. I am further  satisfied that the claimant deposited this gift into the parties' joint bank account  and used it, at least in large part, for the down-payment  for the family residence. If  not all used for the down-payment  and conveyancing  costs, the balance of this gift was used to pay family debts.

[53] In  relying upon N.M.'s evidence, I am alive to its potential frailties, as identified by the respondent.  Having considered them, I conclude  that  they do not create any concerns  and I accept his evidence.

- [54] N.M. was a fair and forthright  witness who was not prone to exaggeration.  He clearly  did not wish to be in court and involved  in this battle, but he answered questions put to him openly and, in my view, honestly.  While I observed him to become defensive when asked about his love for and support of his daughter,  I saw no bias demonstrated in his evidence overall.  He was frank that his relationship with his daughter  had been rocky at times, but that he continues  to love and support her.

As well,  N.M. does not appear to bear the respondent  any ill will. He acknowledged positive things about the respondent.  He also frankly  answered questions that could be considered unhelpful  to the claimant's case in other areas.

- [55] The respondent  identified an inconsistency  in N.M.'s use of language, which he says negatively  impacts the reliability of N.M.'s evidence and his credibility. When discussing these funds with a social worker years later, a social worker noted N.M. as saying that he gave 'them' the funds.  I find this inconsistency  insignificant and not reflective of N.M.'s intention  at the time he made the gift.
- [56] One document was tendered that provides some evidence about the purchase of the family residence. The title search document  from the Land Title Office reflects that the parties were both identified as registered owners of the property,  but the respondent's interest was recorded as an 'undivided  1/100 interest' and the claimant's as an 'undivided 99/100 interest'.  The respondent explained this was done following  a discussion with the person preparing the documentation  in order to take advantage  of a first time home buyer's grant that was only  available to the claimant.
- [57] Following their move into the family residence, their family  life continued on fairly uneventfully  until  the spring of 2014, when  the relationship  between the parties started to unravel.  The respondent suspected the claimant of infidelity.
- [58] On one occasion in May 2014, the respondent  happened to see the claimant's vehicle parked in front  of a residence in a location where he was not expecting her to be. He photographed her car and confronted  her. The claimant denied any wrongdoing and accused him of being insecure. The respondent,  at the time, did feel insecure,  a fact he readily acknowledges now. He was persuaded that the claimant might be right and sought  out personal counselling  for himself.
- [59] Nevertheless,  the respondent  continued to suspect the claimant's infidelity. Utilizing a computer program called 'Find My Phone',  he tracked the claimant's whereabouts from time to time through  her cellular  telephone.  After observing her to

be attending  the same residence where he had photographed her car, he confronted her again. She eventually  confirmed the infidelity. The parties discussed matters and decided to make efforts to salvage their relationship.

[60] I  wish to be clear at this juncture  about the use I make of the claimant's infidelity,  as well as the respondent's prior inappropriate texting relationship.  This conduct  is not relevant  to the issues I am to decide and I will not use it for any purpose other than  for context.

- [61] The respondent's insecurities over these relationship issues created anxiety and sleeping difficulties for him. He sought medical help. In  late May 2014, he started taking a prescribed sleep medication.

[62] Despite the claimant's assurances that they  would work on their relationship, the respondent maintained a degree of suspicion about her relationship with the third party. He continued  to track her whereabouts  without  her knowledge for a further period of time, until  she discovered the computer program and disengaged it. His suspicions were, however,  confirmed.

- [63] On one occasion during this time period, with the Child in his vehicle,  the respondent  drove by the area where he believed the claimant's car might be parked. When he located it, he used his key to roll down the window of her vehicle.  He then took an item belonging to B.A.M. out of the back seat of her vehicle.  The respondent acknowledges now that this behaviour  was 'silly'  and 'childish'.  He does not excuse this behaviour,  but explains that  at the time he was distraught  at the prospect of losing his partner.
- [64] From May until  December 2014, the respondent saw a personal counsellor approximately  18 times in an effort to help him manage the emotional upheaval  in his life. He candidly acknowledges that he was distraught about the dissolution of their relationship and the involvement  of another  person in the claimant's life. He did not want the relationship to end.

- [65] In  October 2014, the respondent  spoke to his doctor about the anxiety  he was experiencing as a result  of the breakdown of the relationship.  His doctor prescribed an anti-anxiety  medication, Ativan. Ativan is taken sublingually,  or by dissolving it under the tongue.  In  mid-November 2014, the respondent  was then prescribed a longer lasting anti-anxiety  medication, Cipralex.
- [66] On November 7, 2014, the date the parties agree is their date of separation, the respondent finally  realized that the claimant had no interest in working on their relationship.  They  agreed to end their relationship.  Neither was willing or financially able to leave the family residence, so they  agreed they  would both stay and live separately under  the same roof until  the claimant 'bought him out' or the family residence was sold. The claimant moved into the basement and the respondent stayed in the master bedroom. A few days after their separation, the respondent installed a lock on the master bedroom door because he did not want the claimant to have access to his room.
- [67] The parties continued to reside in separate areas of the family residence for the next few months.  Everyone  in the home suffered  under this stressful  and unhealthy  arrangement.  The animosity between the parties grew and festered, setting the foundation  for the family's unfortunate  and dramatic downward spiral.
- [68] The parties argued frequently.  They  attempted to reach agreements about how to divide the family property and family debts and how to divide their time with the children,  but could not. In  respect of the children,  the respondent  advocated for equally  shared parenting time, but the claimant would  not agree. She did not want to be a 'half-time'  mom. They  could not reach any agreement about division of family property and debt, and had particular disagreement over the family residence. The claimant expressed an interest in purchasing  the respondent's equity,  but took no active steps to pursue financing  or otherwise.  The parties engaged a realtor at one point to conduct an appraisal, but the claimant would not agree to list the family residence. Each party recognized the unhealthy  home environment  they were

forcing upon  themselves  and the children,  but neither  party was prepared to move out or concede anything  to the other. It  was a stand-off.

[69] On November 10, 2014, only  a few days after the parties agreed to separate, an incident occurred where police and paramedics were called to the family residence. The parties' version of events  differ slightly,  but they  generally  agree that they  argued and the respondent consumed  what he wanted the claimant to believe was an excessive amount of anti-anxiety  medication in order to manipulate  or illicit an emotional response from her.

- [70] Their versions diverge primarily in respect of what  specifically occurred in front of the Child.

[71] The claimant testified that she and the Child were in the kitchen when  the respondent  entered the room. He was angry  and carrying a bottle of his prescription medication. She says the respondent  dumped a handful  of the medication in his hand and consumed it in the Child's presence. She did not react to what he had done and simply took the Child and left the residence to pick B.A.M. up from a sporting activity.  When they  returned  later, the claimant saw that the respondent had mixed a drink. Concerned about mixing pills and alcohol,  she called paramedics and police. They  attended. The respondent  was assessed and determined not to require medical assistance.

[72] The respondent  testified that he came home from work to find that  the claimant had re-arranged the kitchen.  He believed she did this deliberately because she knew from experience this would create a lot of anxiety  for him. It  did create anxiety.  They  argued. The respondent  then  went upstairs to take some of his antianxiety  medication in order to calm himself so that he might sleep. He described that up to this point in time, he had been taking multiple  pills in a day to control  his anxiety.  Taking Ativan at the time, the method by which he took these pills was by dissolving them under his tongue.  When he went  to take them on this particular evening,  he noticed that he had only  five remaining. He took all five by placing them under his tongue  until  they dissolved. He did this upstairs, alone. The respondent  did

not intend to harm himself,  but candidly admits that he wanted to give the claimant that impression, in order to get some kind of emotional response from her.

[73] After taking the pills, the respondent  testified that  he went into the kitchen and tossed the empty pill bottle on the counter  and said words to the effect 'Fine, have  it all'. He acknowledges that the Child was in the room when  he did this. The respondent  got no response from the claimant, emotional or otherwise. He testified that after she and the Child left, he tried to sleep but was unable to do so. He recalled texting the Child to apologize. He also sent the Child a message on his iPod: 'Never forget I love you very much'.  He went back downstairs and consumed two strong drinks to help him sleep. When  the claimant and children came home, he says the parties argued and he went  back up to bed. He fell asleep and woke to find paramedics and RCMP in the family residence.

[74] The respondent  is rightly  ashamed of his conduct now.  He frankly  admits that it was wrong.  He does not seek to excuse his conduct,  but explained that  up to that point, the only  emotion he ever saw from the claimant was anger. He wanted to see her sad or missing him. He still wanted to reconcile at that point. The respondent  has since learned, through  counselling,  that his insecurity  prompted him to do this 'pathetic' act. He aptly  describes his behaviour  on this day as 'one of a few not-sovery-proud  moments in this'.

[75] I  accept the respondent's version of events  where it conflicts  with that  of the claimant here. The respondent's evidence was detailed and consistent.  He was very forthcoming  and did not attempt to minimize his behaviour.  As well,  it is clear from the evidence that the respondent  had only  been prescribed Ativan for anxiety  at this time. As it must be taken sublingually,  the claimant's version of events  seems unlikely.  As this narrative will later reveal, the claimant tends to have  a very  tenuous relationship with the truth  in many  aspects.

[76] In  any event,  I do not think much  turns  on whether  the respondent  actually ingested the medication in the Child's presence or whether  he threw  an empty prescription pill bottle on the counter  and made the remarks he did. What matters is

that the parties' disagreement occurred in the presence of the Child and that the Child was left with the impression that his father  may have attempted self-harm  that night.  Although  the respondent describes his conduct  that evening  as 'pathetic',  I would also describe it as emotionally  harmful  to the Child. It was an attempt to manipulate  the emotions of the claimant with no regard to how it might impact the Child. The attendance  of paramedics and police at the family residence later that night would have  only added to those harmful  effects.

[77] The parties' toxic living arrangement  continued.  They  exposed the children to frequent  arguments  and high tension.

[78] On March 8, 2015, police attended the family residence again. The parties argued over something minor that day. After the argument  ended, the claimant called the RCMP. The respondent  was very  surprised to see police. The officers interviewed the parties separately, following  which they  suggested that  the claimant leave the family  residence for the night.  The claimant refused to leave unless  she could take both children  with her. The  children were sleeping, but she insisted on waking B.A.M. to see if he would leave with her. B.A.M. refused, so the claimant left by herself.  Police then  left the respondent  in the family residence with the two children.  The claimant returned  to the family residence the next  day like 'nothing ever happened'.

[79] The claimant testified that she called police after their argument  that day because the respondent had become 'aggressive towards me' and she had become 'afraid that he could get physical'.  The respondent denies any such conduct.  I find that no such  aggressive or physically  suggestive conduct  occurred. The claimant provided no details about what  the respondent  said or did that caused her to believe these things. There is no evidence that the respondent  had ever been physical  or aggressive with the claimant  that night, or any other night.  As well, I take into consideration that the police asked the claimant, not the respondent,  to leave after their separate interviews.  I am satisfied that if the officers suspected any wrongdoing by the respondent,  they  would have taken a much  different course of action.

[80] The claimant began to call the RCMP (and, as will be seen, the Ministry)  in unwarranted  situations.  This conduct,  as also will be seen, was part of a larger effort to either exclude  the respondent from the Child's life entirely  or at least by the person in complete control of his involvement,  as she had done in the early years of B.A.M.'s life with R.P.

- [81] After this incident, the respondent  decided to remove his firearms from the family residence to his storage locker, a location where he had slowly  been moving his personal possessions in anticipation of the eventual  sale of the family  residence. He moved his firearms following this incident because he felt this was not a 'normal response from the RCMP' and did not want any  issues regarding his firearms later.
- [82] Tensions remained high between the parties. Frequent arguments  continued to occur. The final significant incident that forced the abrupt demise of this most unhappy  living arrangement  occurred during the late evening of March 30, 2015 and into the following  morning.
- [83] The events  of that  night and morning and their aftermath  caused what can only  be described as profound  emotional harm to the Child and B.A.M. The events of that night and morning  led to the respondent's hospitalization,  his accusation that  the claimant tried to poison him, the claimant's denials and counter-accusation  that the respondent  staged his own poisoning in an attempt to frame her for his murder (or attempted murder),  the claimant's hasty  move from the family  residence with the children  into the home of R.P. and E.P. for a time, a lengthy  RCMP investigation, involvement  of the Ministry,  and ultimately  protracted and high conflict litigation, not only  in this court but also in the Provincial Court of British Columbia.
- [84] During the evening  of March 30, 2015, the respondent  could not find his antianxiety  medication. He accused the claimant of taking it. The parties argued. Unbeknownst  to the respondent,  the claimant surreptitiously  recorded their conversation.  The recording was played in court.  Although  both parties referred to the respondent's behaviour  as a 'rant',  I have listened to the recording and observed that the respondent's voice was not raised to any great extent.  The claimant testified

that the respondent made random statements and many threats to her, including  a threat that  he would accuse her of sexually  assaulting the Child. However,  the recording reveals something  different. While the respondent  did discuss many topics that were troubling  him, he did not threaten  to falsely implicate her in sexually abusing the Child. He discussed his ongoing concern  about her continued  behaviour in sleeping with the Child.

[85] The claimant was quiet and calm throughout  this conversation.  She frequently said she was tired and wanted to go to bed, adding to the respondent's obvious frustration.  I place no weight on her demeanour  and/or conduct as captured on the recording. She knew she was being recorded. The respondent  did not. The respondent  asked the claimant several  times to return  his anti-anxiety  medication. She always denied taking it. At one point, the respondent kicked the bed upon which the Child slept in frustration.  The respondent went  to bed without  taking his medication.

[86] The next  morning, the claimant went to work. She testified that she received a call from the RCMP later that day informing her that the respondent had been taken to hospital. She did not attend the hospital. Later on that evening,  the RCMP came to the family  residence and asked if she knew where the respondent's firearms were located. She invited them to look around the family residence. The firearms were not located.

[87] The claimant further  testified that  the following  day, concerned about the respondent's mental  health,  she attended the RCMP detachment  with the recording from March 30 with the intention  of turning  it over to authorities.  While there,  the claimant learned that the respondent had accused her of trying  to poison him. The 'domestic violence coordinator' recommended that she 'pack up the kids and go'. The claimant did not give the recording to police.

[88] The claimant packed up the children  and left the family  residence. She moved in with R.P. and E.P. She testified that within a day or two, a Ministry official (no name specified) advised her to leave Kamloops for her safety. She went to a

location in Vernon for a few days at the beginning of April. When she came back, she resumed residing with R.P. and E.P. To explain his father's absence, she told the Child that his father was not feeling well,  but was getting better and would  be able to see him soon.

[89] RCMP began to investigate the respondent's claim that the claimant poisoned him. There was some evidence tendered about the claimant's failure to cooperate with the police investigation.  As I indicated at trial, I give this evidence no weight at all. The claimant received legal advice. Her choice not to participate in a polygraph examination,  a recorded statement,  or any other police investigative technique,  has no place in this court's consideration. The claimant is entitled to exercise her constitutional  right to silence. Absolutely  no adverse inference can be drawn from her decision to refrain from participating in the police investigation.

[90] The respondent  testified about these events  in detail. He provided more information  about what led up to the parties' argument  and the surreptitious recording on the evening  of March 30, 2015. He testified that they  had been arguing about the children.  At one point, the claimant told him that the children 'do not like you'  and 'do not want to be with you'.  She also told him that he was 'not a good dad'. The respondent  took issue with these remarks and the argument  continued. The claimant then  decided to engage B.A.M. in their dispute. She called B.A.M. to join them and invited him to share his views about the respondent.  B.A.M. told the respondent  that he 'nagged' too much  and was 'too hard' on him. The respondent told B.A.M. that the argument  was not about him. It  hardly  needs to be said that the claimant's involvement  of B.A.M. in this way was inappropriate and harmful  to B.A.M.

[91] After this, the respondent testified that he 'stewed a bit' over these hurtful comments. He tried to sleep, but could not. He decided to take an Ativan. When  he went to retrieve the medicine from his bathroom,  he found  the bottle was missing. He immediately believed that the claimant had taken it the previous week when  he had left his room unlocked for a time. He searched for the claimant and found  her

sleeping with the Child, an activity  which was a continual  source of controversy between them.

[92] The respondent  was candid that he was angry  when  he confronted  the claimant and that a number of long-simmering  grievances 'spewed' out of him. At some point, it is not clear from the evidence exactly  when,  the claimant sent a text message communication  to R.P. to attend the family  residence. R.P. did attend the home and spoke with the respondent.  He described the respondent as angry and not acting like himself.  The respondent  confirmed that he was angry that R.P. had been called. After a time, R.P. assured himself  that everyone  was fine. He left. The discussion continued  between the parties. The respondent was convinced  the claimant had removed his medication from his room. He decided they  could not live under the same roof any longer. At some point, he took her house key and garage fob from her keyring. He then  went to bed, not having  located his medication.

[93] The respondent  testified that the next  morning, he followed his usual  routine. By the time he got up, the claimant had already left the house. He got the children off to school. As was his habit, he had filled his shaker bottle with protein powder the previous day and put it on the counter  in the kitchen to take with him that morning. He picked up the shaker bottle, put it in his bag and took it to work.

[94] While at work that morning, the respondent  testified that he filled the bottle with water and began to consume  the drink. He noticed that it tasted funny.  As he was consuming it and while he walked past his boss' office, he jokingly  said 'If anything  happens to me, this tastes funny'.  Shortly  thereafter,  he recalled sitting at his desk and text  messaging a friend. He then lost consciousness. He awoke in hospital where he remained for approximately  one week.

[95] The respondent  testified that the first day or two in hospital were 'quite foggy'. He was informed that he had a number  of drugs in his system;  however,  there is no direct evidence of this before the court. Doctors believed he had attempted suicide, but the respondent  was adamant that he had not. The respondent  believes the false information  regarding his suicide attempt came from the claimant.  He further

believes that the claimant poisoned him, with medication from the family residence, in order to make it look like a suicide attempt.

[96] When asked why he believes the claimant  poisoned him, the respondent referenced his review of the laboratory  reports (which  are not before the court). He testified that he did not voluntarily  ingest any medication that day. He also referenced the claimant's two strong motivations to have him out of her life. First, she was the beneficiary of a life insurance  policy, the proceeds of which  would allow her to keep the family residence that she had resisted selling and was unable  to afford on her own. Second, the claimant vigorously  opposed his desire for equally shared parenting  time with the Child. She wanted control  over the Child's time, like her arrangement  had been with R.P. and B.A.M. The claimant was used to 'getting her way'. She was not getting it this time.

[97] The respondent  was discharged from hospital on April 6, 2015. He returned  to the family residence and immediately changed the exterior locks for his safety. Shortly  thereafter,  he testified that he discovered a baggie containing white powder residue under the covers of the claimant's bed and a pill bottle with white powder residue in her closet. He called RCMP and said he was asked to gather the items and bring them to the police station.

[98] The claimant vigorously  denies trying  to kill the respondent.  The respondent, with equal vigor, denies attempting suicide or feigning such  an attempt in order to frame the claimant,  as she alleges.

[99] The respondent  explained that he would never  attempt suicide or feign such an attempt in order to frame the claimant as either of those things would be devastating for the Child. He emphasizes that he was not suicidal, nor has he ever been. He has no history  of psychosis. He has no history  of depression and has never been treated for such.  His only  medical treatment  for mental health  issues was related to the situational anxiety  and sleep problems created by the stress of his relationship dissolution.  He emphasizes that upon his discharge from hospital, he was given no treatment  plan for depression or any other mental  illness.

[100] The claimant put an apparent inconsistency  to the respondent during crossexamination.  The respondent's hospital records include an entry  by a psychiatrist that indicates the respondent  did confirm a prior suicide attempt. The respondent says this entry  is incorrect.

[101] Both parties confirmed an extensive  RCMP investigation into these allegations. No criminal charges have ever been laid, against either party.

[102] The respondent  urges me to find, on a balance of probabilities, that the claimant poisoned him on March 31, 2015 by surreptitiously  mixing medications with the protein powder in his shaker bottle. I decline to make such a finding.  The evidence is simply insufficient  to do so.

[103] While I accept the respondent's version of events that evening  and morning, the evidence falls short of proving he was 'poisoned' that day. No admissible evidence was tendered about what caused the respondent's loss of consciousness that morning.  No admissible evidence was tendered about any  drugs found  in the respondent's system upon his admission to hospital. No evidence was tendered about what affects such  drugs, alone or in combination, might have on the human body. No evidence was called about what may have been found in an examination of the shaker bottle or in the pill bottle or baggie later found.  The respondent's beliefs, unsupported  by any other evidence, are insufficient  to make such a finding, even on the civil standard.

[104] However, I do find that  whatever  led to the respondent's hospitalization  that day was not self-inflicted.  I accept his evidence that he did not attempt suicide or attempt to feign suicide to 'frame' the claimant. There is nothing  in the evidence to suggest he was suffering  from such mental  health  or other difficulties that he would do either of those things.  He did not know he was being recorded the night before his hospitalization.  He spoke of his missing medication. He spoke of the future.

[105] Shortly  after the respondent's  discharge from hospital, the Ministry became involved.  Faced with such  competing allegations, officials did not know who to

believe. They  implemented safety plans for both parties that required their time with the Child to be supervised. The requirement  for supervised visits lasted just under three months.

- [106] During this period of supervision,  the claimant resided in the home of R.P. and E.P., along with B.A.M. and the Child. R.P. and E.P. were her supervisors. Although  R.P. and E.P. did the best they  could, the evidence makes clear that they did not strictly supervise the claimant at all times. The claimant  frequently  slept in the same bed as the Child, unsupervised.
- [107] The respondent's parents were his supervisors.  There was no suggestion that they  did not strictly  supervise him during the little parenting time the claimant allowed him to have during the supervision period.
- [108] From this point forward,  the claimant made the respondent's access to the Child very  difficult. From the detailed findings I will now make, a few consistent themes on this topic emerge. First, the claimant often refused to work cooperatively with the respondent on even  the smallest of parenting issues. Second, the claimant often manipulated  situations to prevent or minimize the respondent's  access to information  about and time with the Child. Third, the claimant frequently  ignored Court Orders with respect to parenting time. Finally,  the claimant frequently expressed a desire to co-parent  with the respondent  and have him involved  in decision-making, but her actions were not consistent with her words.
- [109] The claimant rebuffed the respondent's request for visits with the Child during the period of the Ministry's supervision  requirement.  B.A.M. quickly  aligned with his mother and immediately refused to see the respondent.  The respondent has not seen B.A.M. since the night of March 30, 2015. This was, and remains, very  difficult for the respondent.  The respondent stood in the place of a parent to B.A.M. and had a close and loving  relationship with him prior to the parties' separation.
- [110] With respect to the Child, the claimant now had control.  During the threemonth supervision period, the claimant  only permitted the respondent  occasional

visits and only  one overnight  visit. On that occasion, she sent none of the Child's clothing  along with the Child. The respondent  asked that they  set up an interim parenting schedule  to regularize his parenting time with the Child. The claimant refused.

- [111] Evidence of the claimant's manipulation  of the Child began to appear. For example, during his time with the Child, the Child began to ask the respondent  if he could leave early  and go home to the claimant. When  asked why  he wanted to leave early,  the Child disclosed that  his mother  promised to take him to a toy store to purchase him a gift if he was able to leave early from a visit. Other visits were cancelled or changed to suit the claimant.
- [112] On April 21, 2015, the claimant commenced this action. In  addition to filing her Notice of Family Claim, she also filed an application seeking a number of Orders, including an Order for sole occupation of the family  residence, Protection Orders for her and the children,  Orders restricting the respondent from possessing weapons, and other relief. The claimant obtained short leave to have her application heard on April 27, 2015. She served the respondent  with the Notice of Family Claim and her application on April 22, 2015.
- [113] Master McDiarmid heard the application on April 27, 2015. After a contested hearing, the court dismissed most of the claimant's applications. The court ordered both parties restrained and enjoined from charging credit. The court dismissed the claimant's application for exclusive  occupation of the family  residence, but granted liberty to reapply under two conditions (proof the claimant could take over the family residence's expenses and upon removal of the Ministry's  supervision order). The court dismissed the balance of the claimant's applications, including  her applications for Protection Orders, and awarded costs to the respondent.
- [114] On May 11, 2015, only  two weeks after her unsuccessful  application for Protection Orders, the claimant attended the family residence unannounced.  She asked the respondent for entry,  but he refused. She persisted and, at one point, asked him to come outside the residence to talk. He refused and she eventually  left.

[115] The respondent  was 'flabbergasted'  by her attendance at the family Order. She did not appear afraid of the respondent at all, quite the contrary.

residence that day, particularly  in light of her very recent application for a Protection Believing that  perhaps the claimant had attended the family residence that day in order to retrieve her personal belongings, the respondent instructed  his lawyer  to send the claimant's lawyer  a letter canvassing dates for her to do so. A letter was sent. The claimant never  responded.

- [116] On May 15, 2015, the respondent  filed his Response to Family Claim and Counterclaim.  The claimant has never filed a Response to Counterclaim.
- [117] On May 23, 2015, the Child had dental  surgery.  The claimant did not advise the respondent.
- [118] The claimant was to be away from June 5 through  7, 2015. The respondent asked to have the Child during this time. The claimant refused and instead left the Child with R.P. and E.P.
- [119] On June 15, 2015, the claimant's counsel,  David Paul, Q.C., withdrew as her counsel.
- [120] On June 16, 2015, the respondent completed the Parenting After Separation course through  the Justice Education Society of British Columbia. This is a threehour online  course designed to assist parents in understanding  their children's needs during separation. It also provides information on how to help children adjust to the changes taking place in their lives. Parents also receive information  about the Federal Child Support Guidelines and the options available to them to resolve legal and parenting issues.
- [121] On June 23, 2015, the Ministry removed its supervision requirement  for both parties. The claimant did not renew her application for exclusive  occupation of the family residence following  the removal of the supervision  requirement,  or at any other time.

[122] Although  it removed the supervision requirement,  the Ministry  remained involved  with the family. Ministry  staff referred each party to ICS and connected each with a family  support worker. The family  support workers were to help with the parties' conflict over parenting responsibilities, parenting time and the difficulties experienced by the Child during the exchanges.  In the fall of 2015, the respondent connected with a family support worker, Ms. Pater. In  early 2016, the claimant connected with a family support worker, Ms. Ballance.

- [123] On June 23, 2015, the respondent's lawyer  sent a letter to the claimant asking for a response to her letter of May 12, 2015 regarding her retrieval of personal items from the family residence. Counsel asked the claimant to provide some available dates in order to arrange a mutually  agreeable date, time and neutral third party to attend.  Counsel also canvassed the sale of the family residence. In cross-examination,  the claimant  conceded that  she did receive this letter.  She did not respond to this letter.
- [124] At the end of June 2015, the claimant and children moved out of R.P. and E.P.'s residence and into rental accommodation on Whistler Drive. The claimant was reluctant  to acknowledge that her boyfriend  lived there with them, but did eventually concede that he signed the lease agreement and lived there 'off and on' until  they separated several months  later.
- [125] On July  6, 2015, the claimant obtained new counsel,  Ms. Christianson.  The events  of the following  day, July 7, 2015, provide one example of what would become a consistent pattern  on the part of the claimant in refusing to work cooperatively  with the respondent.
- [126] The respondent's counsel  made reasonable efforts to have the claimant attend the family residence in order to retrieve her personal belongings in a mutually agreeable and amicable way.  The claimant deliberately did not respond to those efforts or requests. Instead,  on July 7, 2015, the claimant  attended the family residence at a time when she knew the respondent  was at work. She attended without  notice to him. She obtained entry  to the family residence with the assistance

of a locksmith.  The claimant then removed many  items from the family residence, including  items belonging to the respondent.

[127] The claimant was asked about her conduct  on July  7, 2015 in crossexamination.  She was unapologetic.  She justified her conduct by saying that she was still the 'registered owner',  that she was 'entitled'  to do what she did, and that she took the steps she did because she 'felt the process was going to be long and drawn out'.  Further,  the claimant testified that  she 'consulted  with the RCMP' ahead of time to make sure she was not committing a crime. Satisfied she would not be committing a criminal offence, the claimant went ahead and, using the services of a locksmith,  broke into the family residence.

[128] The events  of the next  two days, July  8 and 9, 2015, provide one example of what would  become another  consistent pattern on the part of the claimant: frustrating  or obstructing  the respondent's parenting time with the Child. The respondent  struggled to obtain access to or information  about the Child. On July  8 and 9, 2015, the following  email exchange between the parties occurred over the Child's baseball schedule:

## [ The claimant ]:

[B.A.M.] wants nothing to do with you. He is not your son. He is very adamant about that. He has made his choice and reasons for that, clearly and specifically. Many of those reasons of which I wasn't previously aware.

[The Child], on the other hand, has been asked to play for the tadpoles for summer baseball. His weekends are packed until the end of the month. He is happy and content at this point and has been for weeks. The boys have been brought together closer than ever. It's been great.

## [ The Respondent ]:

Could I please get the schedule for [the Chid's] baseball? I would like to come and watch.

## [ The claimant ]:

All out of town and he wants me there for all of it.

## [ The respondent ]:

Not a problem for me; I am not concerned for my safety in public places. Could I please have the schedule?

## [ The claimant ]:

Something very wrong with you.

## [ The respondent ]:

Like I said, let's keep opinions and feelings out of this. All I would like is the schedule. …

Thanks.

## [ The claimant ]:

Well, I am concerned for mine because I think you are a sociopath. Thanks.

## [ The respondent ]:

Could I get the schedule please. I would like to watch my son play baseball.

Thank you.

## [129] This email conversation  continued past midnight and into the following  day:

## [ The claimant ]:

Double check your safety plan.

I'll  be attending  my sons baseball. I've made the plans and the arrangements. Don't ruin this experience for him with confusion and drama.

## [ The respondent ]:

I am very aware of what my safety plan entails and I have no intention of breaching it.

Could I please have a copy of the schedule? Further to the items you took, would it be possible to also have one of the Lilly plants and one of the clovers?

## [ The claimant ]:

I'll  return your herb plants, your weights and the Garmin charger.

## [ The respondent ]:

What about my Xbox one? You know I purchased that after our separation. It is not considered to be a family asset. Also the Mickey hand spatula was a gift to me.

Also, could I please get a copy of the ball schedule? It is in [the Child's] best interest I be able to experience in this, as well.

## [ The claimant ]:

[The Child] is over the moon about being on this team. Had you spoken to Chris Balison at the beginning of the baseball season like you said you would, he may have had a more enjoyable spring. I had [the Child] practice with the tadpoles and the next day they asked him to play. [B.A.M.] is helping as well which is a great thing for him to do for his brother.

[The Child] deserves to have this experience free of stress and anxiety. And he has been doing so great these past few weeks. Especially now that he has a few comforts of home.

Both of us being present at the same time will be detrimental, and that is completely unfair to do to him. To push this issue is not in his best interests in my opinion. Just let him enjoy this experience. I will take lots of pictures as I usually do.

## [ The claimant again ]:

I recall you calling me many things. So do the boys, for that matter.

And I will remind you, they are not 'your boys'. [The Child] is OUR son. [B.A.M.] wants nothing to do with you. I simply want some assurances before any visits take place. And I don't trust you.

## [ The respondent ]:

I will not cause him any stress or anxiety. He has a right to have his dad present. If you do not feel you can control your anger when I am present, do not engage me. I will watch and give him my support and love.

- [130] When the claimant was asked about her refusal  to share the Child's baseball schedule  for the season with the respondent,  she provided a variety  of answers that were either inconsistent  with the above email exchange,  that blamed the respondent,  or were simply untrue.
- [131] First, the claimant testified that  she believed the respondent already had the schedule.  Even when  it was pointed out to her that she did not indicate this in any of her email correspondence,  the claimant maintained that  it was the  'real reason' why she did not provide the respondent  with the schedule.  In support of this assertion, the claimant introduced another  email. She testified this particular email enclosed the baseball schedule for the season. However,  close inspection of the email reveals that it did not enclose the baseball schedule for the season. It  was an email pertaining to a particular baseball tournament.
- [132] When pressed further  on why  she refused to provide the Child's baseball schedule  to the respondent,  the claimant then provided a second reason. She asserted that she believed the Ministry's safety plan prohibited them from being at the same place at the same time. This explanation  is untrue.  The safety plans had expired weeks before this email exchange.

- [133] When pressed further  yet again, the claimant finally  conceded that she had simply 'dug her heels in'. However,  in providing this answer,  she framed it in such  a way as to deflect blame or responsibility to the respondent as well. She added that they  both 'dug their heels in' on a lot of issues. The claimant further  added that she was worried about the Child's ability to participate with the respondent present. The basis for this worry  was never explained.
- [134] The claimant's communication  with the respondent  on this one small issue provides a good example of her manipulation  and attempts to control the respondent's access to information  about and time with the Child. Her testimonial explanations  for this conduct provide a good example of her attempts to try and manipulate  the court into believing she had good and valid reasons for conducting herself in the manner  she did. Once her untruthful  excuses were exposed, the real explanations  for her refusal  to cooperate with the respondent were laid bare. They are simple reasons. The claimant wanted the respondent  to have as little information about and time with the Child as possible. She wanted to be in control of when, where and how his parenting time occurred.
- [135] The respondent  continued to make requests to spend time with the Child, which the claimant continually  denied.
- [136] On July  15, 2015, the parties and their lawyers  attended a Judicial Case Conference in front  of Master Baker. There,  they  agreed to a number  of Consent Orders (the 'July  15, 2015 Orders'),  including  Orders pertaining to the preparation of a report by a registered psychologist or psychiatrist  pursuant  to s. 211 of the FLA . The parties also agreed to an interim, without  prejudice schedule  for the respondent's parenting time with the Child. Specifically, the parties agreed to an

Order that  the respondent  have time with the Child as follows:

- a) on Tuesdays and Thursdays, between the hours of 5 p.m. and 8 p.m., except on August 4, 2015;
- b) from 5 p.m. on July 31, 2015 until 4 p.m. on August 3, 2015;
- c) on each of August 8 and 9, 2015 from the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 6 p.m;

- d) on each of August 15 and 16, 2015 from the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 6 p.m;
- e) on each of any other dates and times to which the parties may agree, including, but not limited to; additional days during the week of August 5, 2015 while the Plaintiff is out of the country.

[137] The parties further  agreed that they would  exchange  the Child at a particular shopping plaza,  unless they  agreed otherwise in advance.

[138] The respondent  testified, and I accept, that he desired to have regular and consistent  overnight  visits with the Child, but he agreed to this interim schedule so that he could at least have some time with his son.

- [139] Tuesday,  July  16, 2015 was to be the first day of the respondent's parenting time with the Child according to the July 15, 2015 Orders. The respondent  attended the exchange  location at the agreed upon time, but the claimant did not.  The respondent's parenting time did not occur.

[140] The claimant told the respondent  that she did not attend with the Child at the exchange location that  day because she believed the July  15, 2015 Orders had not 'started yet'. After the lawyers  got involved  in this dispute, the claimant agreed to 'make-up' parenting  time on July 19, 2015.

[141] On July  23, 2015, the claimant cancelled the respondent's  parenting time. She said she had to take B.A.M. to Victoria. She gave the respondent  an alternative date of August  3, 2015.

[142] The claimant's desire to have  the Child spend as little time with the respondent  as possible extended to other members of the respondent's family as well.

[143] On July  27, 2015, the respondent's parents, the Child's grandparents, emailed the claimant to ask if they  could pick up the Child a day before the respondent's scheduled  weekend parenting time in order that the Child might spend a day at their home for a family gathering.  The respondent would  arrive at their

home the following  day. Their email was very  respectful  and reassuring. The claimant refused their request,  writing simply 'I  understand  but our arrangements were for Friday until  Monday after work. [The Child] isn't comfortable going out there without  [the respondent]  or me.'

[144] In  and around this time, the claimant received a telephone  call from a supervisor at ICS offering her services to assist her with co-parenting.  He offered her an appointment  in early August.  The claimant advised him that this appointment  time conflicted with her out of country  travel  with B.A.M. and R.P. When she returned from her trip, the claimant testified that she expected ICS to call her to arrange another  appointment.  They  did not. The claimant did not make any follow-up telephone  calls with ICS.

[145] On July  30, 2015, the claimant told the respondent that,  unless  he left work early to pick up the Child, his parenting time would be cancelled.

[146] The July  15, 2015 Orders specifically contemplated the parties discussing additional parenting time for the respondent from August 5 through  12, 2015, when the claimant was to be out of the country  with B.A.M. and R.P. The respondent  did ask the claimant for additional time. The claimant refused.  As a result,  the Child did not have extra parenting time with his father that week and remained in the home and under  the care of E.P.

[147] The claimant was not flexible with the respondent's parenting times. For example, the respondent  was required to attend training for his employment  on August 18 and 20, 2015. He advised the claimant of this scheduling  conflict  and asked that the parenting time those days be rescheduled.  She refused.

[148] On August 19, 2015, the claimant's former counsel,  Mr. Paul, attended an appointment  in front  of the Registrar to review his bill for legal fees, a portion of which remained unpaid by the claimant.  The claimant did not attend this appointment.  The Registrar certified that the claimant owed $3,892.32 to Mr. Paul.

Judgment was obtained in this amount  on August 27, 2015. This Judgment  was subsequently  registered against the family residence.

- [149] The claimant testified that she did not attend this appointment on August 19, 2015, because she was likely out of the country  and did not know about the hearing. These explanations  are both untrue.
- [150] Court records prove that on August  4, 2015 the claimant was personally served with the Notice of Appointment for 11:30 a.m. on August 19, 2015 and related documents.  August 4, 2015 was the day before she left for her out of country trip with B.A.M. and R.P. The claimant clearly  knew about the appointment.  The appointment  occurred on August 19, 2015. The claimant was back in the country  for a week at this point. She could have attended the appointment.
- [151] The above example is indicative of another  theme or pattern  in the claimant's conduct.  As will be seen, the claimant has frequently  ignored court orders and/or chosen not to attend court or other important proceedings in her life. She later falsely claims that she was not aware of the proceedings or provides other implausible excuses.
- [152] The month of September 2015 brought the respondent  many difficulties in his efforts to have parenting time with the Child.
- [153] For the first two weeks of September, the claimant failed to bring the Child to the exchange  location on any  of the Tuesday  or Thursday  times. The claimant told the respondent that he was not entitled to any more parenting  time with the Child because the July  15, 2015 Orders had 'expired'. There is clearly  no 'expiration date' on the July  15, 2015 Orders. Lawyers again had to become involved  in this dispute.
- [154] Through  counsel,  the parties negotiated another interim, without  prejudice, parenting time schedule for the respondent.  The parties reached this agreement on September 17, 2015. An Order was subsequently  drafted by counsel and approved by the court on October 15, 2015 (the  'October 15, 2015 Orders').

[155] This new interim, without  prejudice, agreement included  the same Tuesday and Thursday  times and other specific dates, including  Saturday,  October 10 and Sunday,  October 11, during specific times. Again, the respondent testified, and I accept, that he could not persuade the claimant to agree to overnight  parenting time. The respondent  wanted more parenting time, including  overnight  time, but he felt he had to accept this schedule in order to see his son. As he testified, it was 'take it or leave it'. He decided to 'take it'.

[156]  Having reached this new agreement on September 17, 2015, the respondent attended the exchange  location at the agreed upon time that  day. September 17, 2015 was a Thursday.  He had not seen the Child since August.  The claimant did not attend. The claimant later told the respondent  that because there was no 'signed Order' yet, she was not required to produce the Child.

[157] On September 20, 2015, the Child was sick and unable  to attend his hockey practice or game. The respondent  offered to care for the Child while he was sick during the time the claimant attended B.A.M.'s sporting activity  that day. The claimant refused.

[158] On other occasions, the respondent offered to drive the Child to and from the claimant's home for his hockey,  in order that  he might have  a little extra time with the Child. The claimant consistently  refused.

[159] On September 29, 2015, the respondent  emailed the claimant to ask if she could provide some flexibility  in the  times of some upcoming visits. Specifically, he advised the claimant he would have to drop off the Child about an hour (6:30 p.m.) earlier on his Thursday,  October 1, 2015 visit. He also asked if he could pick up the Child at 5 a.m. instead of 9 a.m. on his Saturday,  October 3, 2015 visit.

[160] The claimant simply told him 'no' to his weekend request. In  respect of the Thursday  request, she asked him why  he needed a 6:30 p.m. drop off time. The respondent  tried to persuade the claimant. He wrote '[The  Child] would like to go hunting  and it would be beneficial for us to up in the hills before 9 a.m. pick up'. With

respect to the request for 6:30 p.m. drop off that Thursday,  the respondent wrote 'I am unable to make it later'. The claimant responded sarcastically.  She wrote:

You complain it's not 'enough time' yet you can't see him for the evening Thursday? Interesting. Now what could possibly be more important than parenting time?

4:30 - 7:30 Thursday. I'll assume you'll cancel then.

- [161] The respondent  initially stood his ground and replied:

I will not cancel and I will drop him off at your house at 630 p.m. I would rather have two hours than nothing. We have plans for the two hours.

- [162] The claimant responded:

You aren't coming near my house. Actually, you're in my house but that's a story for another day.

The agreement is 4:30 until 7:30. Take it or leave it. Let's try and be consistent.

- [163] The respondent,  deciding to 'take it', replied 'See you on Thursday  at 4:30 pm. in the Heritage House parking lot'.
- [164] As a result  of his decision to 'take it', the respondent cancelled his appointment  that would have required him to return  the Child to the claimant an hour earlier on October 1, 2015. I will return  to what happened on October 1, 2015 shortly.
- [165] Both parties agree that the Child began to exhibit symptoms of anxiety  and stress before and during parenting times with his father in the fall of 2015. He also began to express an unwillingness  to attend those visits. The respondent  noticed that the Child appeared pale on occasion and seemed anxious  or nervous.  The Child began to ask the respondent to go back to the claimant's home early because the claimant and B.A.M. were having a 'movie marathon'  or some other similar fun activity with which  the Child wished to be a part. The Child did not or could not explain why  he was having  a change of heart in regard to spending time with his father.

[166] On September 30, 2015, the respondent  emailed the claimant and suggested that they  set up some counselling  for the Child. The respondent  expressed a willingness  to organize the counselling,  but was seeking the claimant's agreement. The claimant's response provides yet another example about the claimant's view of the role she thought  the respondent should  have in the Child's life and her level of respect for the respondent.  The claimant responded by writing that the Child 'has already been in counselling.  You're  about 5 months  late on that suggestion'.

- [167] The respondent  inquired about the name of the counsellor  that the Child had been seeing, his or her contact information  and other information.  The respondent expressed that he had a particular counsellor  in mind. The claimant replied 'You  are in no position to tell me what to do. We have  our counsellors  and are happy with them'.
- [168] The respondent  then asked for the claimant's cooperation to provide him the name and contact information for the counsellor  so that he might be involved.  The claimant replied 'We will continue  to work with our counsellor  as clearly  yours  has done nothing  for you.  You  are still bat shit crazy  it would appear'.
- [169] The claimant was unapologetic about these emails at trial. When asked to explain why  she did not advise the respondent  about having  the Child see a counsellor  at the time the Child's counselling  commenced, she testified that she assumed the respondent would have been informed by the Ministry.  When pressed about why she refused to give the respondent the name of the Child's counsellor  in the above exchange,  the claimant paused for a very  long time before testifying  'I don't have an answer for you'.
- [170] The answer is clear. The claimant did not want  the respondent  involved  in the Child's life. She wanted to be the sole decision-maker and in total control  as she had done with B.A.M. and B.A.M.'s father.
- [171] On October 1, 2015, the respondent  attended the Heritage House parking lot at 4:30 p.m. in accordance with the October 15, 2015 Orders. He waited. The claimant did not attend. He sent her a text message at 4:36 p.m. asking if she was

'close'. He received no response. He tried calling.  He received no response. He then  sent the claimant an email at 4:45 p.m. asking where she was. The claimant replied via text  message at 4:45 p.m. Despite the text  message exchange  two days earlier, detailed above, the claimant wrote that it was her understanding  that the respondent  had plans that  evening and could not visit with the Child. She further wrote that she now had plans that included the Child. Referencing  that earlier exchange on September 30, 2015, the respondent replied 'You  said all or nothing.  I said see you at 4:30 p.m.'

[172] To this, the claimant replied 'I must  have missed that. You  made plans on a day when you had a planned visit with [the Child]'.

[173] When asked about her conduct on this day, the claimant conceded that 'egos came into play unfortunately'.  However,  the evidence establishes that there was much more behind the claimant's conduct  that day than  simply her ego. Her conduct on this day forms part of a larger pattern of deliberate conduct designed to control the respondent's parenting time with the Child. I find the claimant deliberately chose not to bring the Child to the exchange  location that day, knowing that the respondent was under the impression his full  scheduled time with the Child was to occur. The claimant took these steps in order to 'teach' the respondent that he was not to challenge  her decision-making or he would not see the Child.

[174] Realizing that he was not going to get his parenting  time that day, the respondent  re-visited his effort to pick up the Child early  that Saturday morning for a hunting  trip. He asked the claimant to reconsider a pick up time of 5 a.m. and consider that it might be viewed as 'make-up' time for his now thwarted  visit. The claimant refused, writing 'it simply won't work' and informed the respondent that he could 'make-up a visit next  week'. The respondent  persisted, urging her to reconsider in light of the Child's enjoyment  of a hunting  trip. Her reply is telling.  She wrote 'Maybe you  should keep things  simple from now on and stick with your  visit times. Just a suggestion'.

[175] The respondent  kept notes of his parenting time between July  5 and October 2, 2015. From his review of those notes, the respondent found  that of the 31 court

ordered parenting time occasions during that timeframe, the claimant refused to abide by 11 of them.  As well, on certain occasions, the claimant encouraged the Child to call his father directly  to ask him for a change to the parenting time. When asked whether  she thought  it was acceptable to put the Child in the middle of the conflict in this way, the claimant maintained that  it was an acceptable practice. In  her view, it gives the Child a 'voice'.

[176] On Sunday, October 11, 2015, the respondent's parenting  time with the Child was to start at 9 a.m. The Child had hockey that morning.  The respondent  had been on the ice with the Child and the rest of his team. The claimant took the Child off the ice early and left with him.

[177] The respondent  arrived at the exchange  location at 9 a.m. The claimant was not there. Text  messages were exchanged  between the parties. At 9:18 a.m., the claimant wrote that the Child did not want to stay at the rink and 'doesn't want to visit with you today. Of course I'll  make him but I've  taken him for breakfast. Meet at Rexall'.  One minute  later, the respondent replied 'I am here and you  are not'.  The claimant respondent  by telling him that  she and the Child were at a nearby restaurant  having breakfast. She informed him 'Just got our meal. Done soon. He really  doesn't want to see you today so I'm trying  to cheer him up'.  The exchange went downhill  from there. The respondent  told the claimant she was being disrespectful and there would  be consequences  to her 'poor behaviour'.  The claimant called the respondent  a 'petty,  vengeful,  little man'.  She also sent him some images, one of which was offensive.  In  the end, the claimant finished her breakfast with the Child and delivered the Child to the respondent approximately  45 minutes late.

[178] The next  day, the claimant hosted a Thanksgiving  dinner. She sent the respondent  a message that read 'Hahaha  accidentally  counted you  at the table setting! Nope! No nagging THIS year!' Again, the claimant was unapologetic  about this communication.  When asked her purpose in sending it, she simply shrugged and offered that  it was the first year she had not been nagged.

[179] On October 13, 2015, the claimant had the Child call the respondent  to seek to change the parenting  time so the Child could go on a play date. After the Child called him in tears, the respondent agreed to forego his parenting time.

[180] On October 14, 2015, the respondent's parenting time was cancelled again by the claimant.  As a result,  the respondent asked for 'make-up' time that upcoming Sunday from 4:30 to 7:30 p.m. He explained that the Child's grandparents  and brothers would be at his home for dinner that day and thought  it would be nice if they were able to see the Child and the Child was able to see them. The  conversation continued  as follows:

## [ The claimant ]:

Can't do Sunday. I'm sorry.

## [ The respondent ]:

I am sure you can find a way to make it work. I will take him for the entire day and use both makeup days, if you can make that work.

## [ The claimant ]:

I cannot make that work for this weekend.

## [ The claimant again ]:

Otherwise I would agree to that solution.

## [ The respondent ]:

Right.

## [ The claimant ]:

Our life is extremely busy and plans have been made for this weekend.

## [ The claimant again ]

It's certainly no [bachelor] life over here! lol

## [ The respondent ]:

What are you doing? Is there something I can do to make it happen for Sunday?

## [ The claimant ]:

No there isn't. We have the weekend planned.

## [ The claimant again ]:

Are you asking what my plans are, or are you asking in a douchey kind of way?

## [ The respondent ]:

I'm trying to find a way for [the Child] to attend a dinner with his grandparents, his dad and his brothers.

## [ The claimant ]:

Having a family is BUSY!!!!

## [ The claimant again ]:

I understand. Plan it for a weekend you have him. That's one of the awesome things about having a schedule. Having said that [the Child] wants to travel with [B.A.M.] on one of your weekends. I told him to talk to you about that. The boys are a lot closer than they ever were.

## [ The respondent ]:

It's a special occasion. Are you out of town?

## [ The respondent again ]:

If you would like [the Child] on a weekend I am scheduled with him, I suggest you ask me. Putting it on [the Child] is unfair to him. If you and I agree, then you can suggest he ask me.

## [ The claimant ]:

Our plans are none of your business. I don't ask you about your plans. It's not about what I want. It's [the Child's] request.

## [ The claimant again ]:

I keep telling him he has options, he doesn't have to go to all of [B.A.M.'s] things. He wants to.

## [ The respondent ]:

So Sunday is for [B.A.M.'s] hockey?

## [ The claimant ]:

Lol!! No. Let me put this another way to help you grasp this…we have plans for this weekend.

## [ The claimant again ]:

You do not have him this weekend.

## [ The respondent ]:

Maybe [the Child] would like to see his grandparents and his brothers. Why don't we have a phone call and ask him?

## [ The claimant ]:

Our plans do not include you. Which is a shame because that's what I wanted and hoped for, for him, to include you in family plans, but you had to go nuts and forever put him in the awkward spot. Congratulatons. You are a model parent.

## [ The claimant again ]:

We. Have. Plans. This. Weekend.

## [ The claimant again ]:

I can't even put it in plain English for you…this is so bizarre. I think Friday will work from 4:30 until 7:30.

## [ The respondent ]:

Please provide me an email so you don't misunderstand.

## [ The claimant ]:

So I don't or you don't?

## [ The respondent ]:

What are the chances you will agree to a 6 am pick up next week?

## [ The claimant ]:

You know… I find it less motivating to be accommodating when you insist on being an arrogant prick. Maybe you should use your manners.

## [ The claimant again ]:

[The Child] said no to 6 am

- [181] This exchange  is noteworthy  for a few reasons. First, it is an example of the claimant's dismissive and demeaning attitude toward the respondent.  Second, it is an example of the claimant's continued  persistence in placing the Child in the middle of the conflict.  Third,  and perhaps even more troubling,  is that  the 'plans'  held so firmly  by the claimant that weekend, the reason why  she could not allow the Child to spend three hours with his father's family  for a dinner,  did not even involve  the Child. The claimant went to Disneyland  that weekend with her own mother while the Child stayed with R.P. and E.P.
- [182] When asked to explain this conduct,  the claimant testified, again unapologetically,  that having a weekend 'go without  complications' was her priority. Clearly,  having the Child spend time with his father and his father's family was not her priority.
- [183] As difficulties of this nature  continued  to occur, the respondent  filed an application seeking specified parenting time (including  equal parenting time), child support and an Order for sale of the family residence. The application was contested and was heard by Madam Justice Hyslop on November 9, 2015.

[184] In  reasons delivered on November 10, 2015, Hyslop  J. made a number  of Orders (the 'November  10, 2015 Orders'). In  respect of the family  residence, the court adjourned  the respondent's application for sale for a period of 60 days and granted the respondent  exclusive  occupation.

[185] In  respect of the Child, the court declared the parties to be guardians,  ordered the respondent to pay interim child support commencing December 1, and ordered detailed interim parenting time, including  overnight  parenting time for the respondent.  Overall,  the respondent  was granted much  more parenting time than  he had been permitted thus  far by the claimant.

[186] The court resolved the thorny  issue of the exchanges  by ordering pick up and drop off to occur primarily at the Child's school. When school was not in session, the court ordered:

11. When school is not in session, the respondent shall return the Child to the claimant's residence by ringing the doorbell or knocking on the door of her home and then retreating to the sidewalk or the street and watch until the Child goes inside the home. During the parenting time exchanges, the claimant and the respondent are not to communicate with one another.
- [187] Madam Justice Hyslop also made a number of conduct Orders, including:
10. Each party shall advise each other in writing of their current address, telephone number and cell phone number and will also advise each other of any changes to their contact information.

…

12. Any communication between the parties must be by text or email and relate only to urgent matters relating to the Child.
13. The Child shall not be enrolled in any other activity other than swimming or baseball except with the consent of both parties…

[188] Prior to this child support order and commencing at the end of September 2015, the respondent  voluntarily  paid the claimant $100 per week. Since the November 10, 2015 Orders, the respondent has paid the required amount  of child support. He paid the claimant by way of e-Transfer.  The e-Transfer  password provided by the respondent shows the respondent's immature behaviour  at the time. The password he selected was 'karma'. He did this knowing  it would aggravate the

claimant.  He did this because he wanted to communicate to her that he thought  she had done 'bad things' so 'bad things'  would happen to her.

- [189] Fortunately,  the respondent has engaged in personal counselling  that has assisted him in developing insight into his self-professed 'childish'  and 'pathetic' behaviours  and enabled him to stop them.
- [190] The respondent's efforts to improve himself,  his parenting abilities and his communication skills with the claimant began earnestly  in the fall of 2015 and continue  to this day. As the respondent's maturity  and insight into his own behaviours  and the needs of the Child developed, his communication  skills and behaviours  have also improved. For example, during the fall of 2015, the respondent availed himself of certain parenting resources in the community.  He worked regularly with his support worker, Ms. Pater, meeting often with her. He completed a program called 'Caring Dads'. The respondent continued  to meet and work with Ms. Pater on improving his parenting skills until  she closed their service agreement in the summer of 2016. He worked thereafter  with Ms. Ballance and Mr. Reedman, frequently seeking and accepting their help and advice.
- [191] Following the November 10, 2015 Orders, the Child's behaviour  continued  to deteriorate around parenting time with his father.  He began to actively  and physically fight going with his father.  The ordeals were terrible for the Child and terrible for anyone trying  to help him.
- [192] The respondent  could not understand  why the Child was behaving in this way because his parenting time had started out very  positively. The Child was initially happy to see and spend time with his father.  He often did not want to leave his father.  However,  over time, the Child began to express an unwillingness  to spend time with his father. He continued  to go, but often asked to be permitted to return  to the claimant's home early. This behaviour  progressed to a point where the Child would take steps to actively  prevent  the parenting time with  the respondent.  These steps included leaving school on the days the respondent was scheduled to pick him

up there.  The respondent struggled  to understand  the attitudinal  and behavioural changes that had occurred so quickly  and dramatically  in his son.

[193] On November 26, 2015, the respondent  emailed Ms. Lubin to report his concerns about, among other things, the Child's deteriorating desire to spend time with him.

[194] The respondent  also contacted the Ministry  on November 27, 2015 to report a concern that  the Child had been left home alone. That day, the claimant contacted the respondent to advise him that the Child was home sick and would  not be at school. As this was the respondent's scheduled  pick up day from school, the respondent  offered to pick up the Child from the claimant's home and care for him for the day. The claimant declined the offer saying 'sometimes a child needs his mom' or words to that effect. This led the respondent  to believe the claimant was at home caring for the Child. When the respondent then  learned the claimant was actually  at work, he believed the Child was at home alone. He reported his concern to Ms. Lubin. Ms. Lubin contacted the claimant. The claimant advised that she had left the Child home with a friend that day. This event  only  occurred because the claimant clearly  led the respondent  to believe she was at home caring for the Child. Had she been honest,  no call to the Ministry  would have been placed.

[195] The exchanges that were required to occur at the claimant's home deteriorated as well.  It became a 'battle' to get the Child to go with the respondent for his parenting time. The claimant testified that she encouraged the Child to go at exchange times. When others were present,  they witnessed the claimant's encouragement.

[196] On December 1, 2015, Ms. Lubin sent another  referral to ICS to provide services to the claimant. Ms. Lubin met with the claimant that day and informed her that the Ministry required her to connect  with the family support worker.

[197] On December 18, 2015, the claimant filed complaints with the Ministry  about the Ministry officials' conduct toward her.

[198] At the Christmas Day exchange,  the respondent regretfully  had to call the RCMP for assistance in getting the Child to leave the claimant's home. The attending officer managed to convince  the Child to go with his father.  When  the Child arrived at the respondent's home, his demeanour and attitude changed almost immediately. He was happy.  He visited with his grandparents.  At one point, he even expressed that he did not want to go back to his mother's home.

[199] Commencing in late December 2015 and over the next several months,  the claimant made several reports to the Ministry  alleging that the respondent  posed a danger to the Child. The Ministry  responded and found  the allegations unsubstantiated.

[200] In  January  of 2016, the claimant began working with a family support worker, Ms. Ballance.  Ms. Ballance was initially asked to work with the claimant to support her in respect of co-parenting  issues, emotional regulation,  attachment  work and other issues. However,  from January  2016 until  the end of May 2016, Ms. Ballance's work with the claimant was largely 'crisis-driven'.  Through  their initial discussions, it became clear that co-parenting was not going to be an option, so Ms. Ballance provided assistance more in the area of support for the issues the Child was experiencing.  The claimant and Ms. Ballance had meetings and/or conversations that largely  revolved  around the Child's behaviours  before parenting time with the respondent.  There were many  such crises.

[201] As crisis-driven work, Ms. Ballance testified that  she was never able to reach a point with the claimant where they  could set goals and develop a service plan.  Ms. Ballance explained that she received text messages or phone calls from the claimant when a crisis would occur. It  was her perception that the claimant was not looking so much for guidance, but rather  it appeared that she needed to tell someone about the difficulties with the parenting  time exchanges.

[202] Ms. Ballance conducted approximately  four or five home visits when  the children  were present with the claimant.  She observed positive interactions between them. She noticed nothing  of concern.  From all of the evidence adduced in this case,

it is clear that Ms. Ballance did provide support in a fair and unbiased way to the claimant to the best of her abilities. That she and the claimant were unable to develop a service plan was as a result  of the crisis-driven work in their several months together.  There is no merit to the suggestion that  the lack of a service plan was as a result of some bias against her or conspiracy to provide her with lesser services than  that provided to the respondent.

[203] The parties jointly  retained Dr. Aubé to prepare the s. 211 report. The parties met separately with Dr. Aubé in early February  2016. I will return  to Dr. Aubé's report later in this chronology.

[204] The time leading up to the respondent's parenting time continued to be difficult for the Child.

[205] For example,  on February  19, 2016, approximately  two and a half hours before the respondent's scheduled pick up time, the claimant had the Child attempt to call his father  to tell him he did not want  to go with his father  for the weekend. The Child's attempt to reach the respondent  was unsuccessful.  The claimant sent the respondent  a text message. The respondent  replied that he would  retrieve the Child at the arranged time and they  could discuss it then.

[206] The respondent  arrived at the claimant's residence at the correct time. He waited in his car. Over the next 15 minutes,  the respondent  sent the claimant four text message communications advising her that he was there to pick up the Child. The claimant did not respond to any of them. The Child did not come out of the residence. The respondent  left.

[207] Three hours  later, the claimant  responded to the respondent's text  messages. She told the respondent that  the Child had been ready to see him at the arranged time and had been waiting by the door. Content  to try again, the respondent went back to the claimant's residence. The Child came outside to his father's vehicle,  but proceeded to try and negotiate his way out of the parenting time. The Child was emotionally  distraught  and repeatedly  walked back and forth  between his mother in

her home and his father  in his truck,  trying  to persuade them to let him stay with the claimant.

[208] These types of difficulties,  as well as outright  cancellations  of the respondent's parenting time, continued  over the next month.

- [209] As only  one of many examples,  the respondent's parenting time was cancelled without  notice on April 1, 2016 because the claimant took the Child with her to Kelowna.
- [210] The Report of Dr. Aubé was not delivered to the parties until  approximately mid-April. The delay occurred because the claimant was unhappy  with certain aspects around the Report's preparation and unilaterally  decided to put a 'stop payment'  on her cheque. Payment  was ultimately  received and the Report was delivered. This leads me to discuss the Report.
- [211] I  will  first discuss the context  and purpose of s. 211 reports. I do this mainly for the claimant's benefit. Mr. Justice Kent provided a useful  summary  of the purpose and principles of a s. 211 report in Kwan v. Lai , 2016 BCSC 1626 at para. 46:
- [46] I have commented elsewhere on the context and purpose of a Section 211 Report (see Dimitijevich v. Pavlovich , 2016 BCSC 1526) and there is no need to repeat those observations here. Suffice it to say:
* Section 211 of the Family Law Act permits the court to seek the assistance of an independent and impartial investigator and to call on that investigator to make recommendations based on the results of his/her investigation ( K.M.W. v. L.J.W ., 2010 BCCA 572 at para. 50);
* The facts stated in the Section 211 Report are prima facie evidence of their truth (supra, para. 50);
* In performing this role, the court appointed expert functions as "the eyes and ears of the court" and is expected to be impartial, and unbiased, and to make objective recommendations rather than acting as an advocate for any party;
* Where the assessor is a registered professional with the College of Psychologists of British Columbia, he/ she is expected to abide by the "code of conduct" promulgated by that college which imposes various requirements for undertaking assessments and formulating recommendations that are appropriately comprehensive, objective and balanced;

* There is no protocol or checklist that must be exactly followed in every case and the authors of Section 211 Reports are free to use their education, experience and expertise to conduct the assessments with an eye to assisting the courts in determining what is in the children's best interests ( L.C.T. v. R.K ., 2015 BCSC 2378 at para. 419);

* Nevertheless, the court is not obliged to accept the opinions or recommendations of the Section 211 experts; the court does not abdicate its role as the ultimate decision-maker but will give such weight to the Section 211 experts' recommendations and opinions as is appropriate having regard to the circumstances of the case and the relevant evidence adduced ( Shapiro v. Simpson , 2016 BCSC 211 at paras. 102-103).

[212] It  is with these principles in mind that I approach the Report. I have paid particular attention  to those areas the claimant  suggests are problematic.

[213] Dr. Aubé is a well-qualified  clinical and forensic psychologist.  Having worked in psychology  with children  and families for over 35 years and testified in all levels  of court in British Columbia, she expressed her awareness of her duty to the court.

[214] Both parties participated fully  in the assessment process. Dr. Aubé considered a large number  of documents provided by the parties, identified at pages 2 and 3 of the Report. She interviewed  the parties separately over two days, conducted psychometric  assessments of them, observed them with the Child, interviewed the Child and B.A.M. in person and conducted several  telephone interviews  with collateral sources, including  R.P., E.P., Ms. Pater, Ms. Lubin and others. A few of the claimant's collateral contacts  provided follow-up  email communications to Dr. Aubé as well. The claimant's collateral  contacts all provided positive information about the claimant's parenting abilities.

[215] The parties separately spent several hours  with Dr. Aubé over a two-day period. They  each provided historical information.  The claimant submits the respondent  'profoundly  misrepresented' the claimant's involvement  and has 'misrepresented facts in order to mislead Dr. Aubé'. I have carefully  reviewed the Report. I do not see that the respondent has done any of these things.  The

information  provided by the respondent to Dr. Aubé is consistent with the evidence I have accepted at trial.

[216] The claimant makes similar complaints about the information provided to Dr. Aubé by the Ministry.  Again, I do not see that the Ministry has provided any inaccurate information  that would,  or did, mislead Dr. Aubé.

[217] As part of her evaluation,  Dr. Aubé met with the Child at the claimant's home on February  3, 2016. She observed that immediately upon their introduction,  in her attempt to explain to the Child that she was a 'feeling doctor', he immediately stated 'I  feel safer with my mom'. Dr. Aubé found this unprompted  statement  from the Child surprising as they  had not yet started any interview.

[218] Several aspects of Dr. Aubé's interview  with the Child are noteworthy.  Dr. Aubé noted that the Child did not have anything  negative to say about his mother. When asked what he liked about his father,  he initially could not come up with anything.  He later reported that he liked playing video games with his father.  When asked to specify what he did not like about his father,  the Child could not explain or come up with an example. Dr. Aubé also noted that the Child repeated during the interview  that he did not feel 'safe' around his father,  but again could not explain why.  The Child was clear that  his father  had never hurt  him. Dr. Aubé found this part of the interview  quite meaningful  because the Child became agitated and uncomfortable  when  asked those questions and could not identify any examples of his father's behaviour  that scared him.

[219] Dr. Aubé met again with the Child the following day, this time in the respondent's home. The Child appeared pleased to show Dr. Aubé his room and one of his toys. When asked about his father,  this time the Child reported to generally  having  a good time with his father.  He reported enjoying  playing games and teasing his father.

[220] When asked about when his family lived together,  the Child told Dr. Aubé that he found  it easier, as he did not have to move from one home to another.  When

asked, he told Dr. Aubé that he likes both parents and sometimes feels in the middle of their battle. Dr. Aubé noted that 'he felt compelled to add that  he liked to be more at his mom's' (page 26).

[221] The Child discussed some of his feelings with Dr. Aubé. He disclosed feeling anger and sadness. He used to feel happy when  they  were all together.  He felt some sadness because he did not like to be separated from his mother.  He explained that he was happy before with his dad, when  they  used to live in the same house. The Child candidly reported that he aware of the battle between his parents and felt their battle was 'because of him'. He added that as a result  of an occasion where the respondent  called police to facilitate his parenting time, he has been 'more scared of daddy'.

[222] Dr. Aubé was able to observe the respondent  and the Child, as well as the claimant and the Child (and B.A.M.),  interact in their home environments.

[223] Dr. Aubé witnessed a very strong attachment  between the claimant and both children.  They  were seen to be at ease and very  comfortable with their mother. Nothing  of concern  was noted.

[224] With respect to the respondent,  Dr. Aubé made similar observations.  She noted the Child was at ease with his father.  The Child teased his father and they had fun  playing games. Dr. Aubé noted no tension or anxiety,  that the Child's 'movements  were fluid', that he responded well to his father's instructions  and appeared content  to be with his father.  Dr. Aubé witnessed a strong attachment between the respondent and the Child.

[225] Dr. Aubé noted the discrepancy between the Child's words and actions in regard to his father,  writing at page 29:

It seems important to point out the huge discrepancy between [the Child's] verbal statements about his father and his non-verbal attitude and demeanour when with his dad. It was quite striking to observe how genuine and relaxed the relationship between [the Child] and [the respondent] was. There was no sign of the apprehension alluded to by [the claimant]; [the Child] clearly was enjoying time with his father.

[226] As part of her evaluation,  Dr. Aubé administered certain psychological tests to the parties. Her discussion of those tests commenced with an important caution. At page 9, she wrote:

It is important to specify that the psychological test results presented in this assessment are hypothesis [sic] that should not be considered in isolation from the rest of the assessment. The results from the personality inventory offer a description of individuals whose profile and/or response patterns are similar to that of the person who is evaluated. One needs to know that the test results have been scored through computer programmes and can provide interpretation that will be considered and analysed in conjunction with the other information received, and relevant research. Individual  test results cannot be taken as valid and meaningful on their own and must be considered in light of other test results and related information.

[227] Dr. Aubé's Clinical Impression  section commenced at page 37. She explained that the Clinical Impression  is based upon an accumulation  of various data, including the various interviews she conducted, the collateral  information,  the observation sessions and the document review.

[228] With respect to the respondent,  Dr. Aubé found him to be 'people pleaser' and 'more often than  not, his main objective has been to feel accepted'. She continued  at pages 37 and 38:

…[The respondent] approached this psychological evaluation with authenticity; he was forthcoming. He did recognize that he did not contribute his maximum into his first marital relationship. I am confident that he really wanted his relationship with [the claimant] to work out. I disagree with him when he states he was in a co-dependent relationship. He was indeed dependent of his relationship with [the claimant] but in my judgement, [the claimant] would not permit herself to be dependent on a relationship.

[The respondent] is gentle and is a very private person; he is soft-spoken, naive and, generally speaking, avoidant of conflict. He is also a very sensitive man and I believe he regressed a great deal when he became cognisant that his marriage was falling apart. I suppose that during this period he was more intolerant. It seems also that he was clinging to his relationship and that his judgment was not his best. I also believe both B.A.M. and [the Child], in their respective statements to MCFD, that both [the claimant] and [the respondent] were fighting a great deal and that [the respondent] was very much involved in the yelling matches.

When living with [the claimant], I have no doubt that [the respondent] was often overwhelmed by the emotional tone and unsolved conflicts which increased his anxiety. In some ways, [the respondent] is ill at ease when dealing with feelings; he gets rapidly flabbergasted when emotions are

challenging. There is certainly a level of sadness that one can perceive that stems from his childhood. It is as if he feels that he never got the space and the endorsement that he deserved. One may wonder to what extent there was conditional love in his childhood, which would be responsible for a deep rooted level of insecurity that is expressed by a higher level of anxiety. He is an insecure man with a fragile ego. I trust [the claimant] when she describes [the respondent] as filled with self-doubt.

I suspect that [the respondent] was attracted by [the claimant's] strong personality, which she can display; it made him feel safe. When their relationship broke down, to his dismay, he was overwhelmed and unable to fight her on the same level. Although it is clear that his anxiety increased and that he was not at his best, I do not believe that he was ever suicidal. His gestures were melodramatic, a mixture between 'a poor me attitude' and a message of 'please come back to me I need you'.

Although, [the respondent] does not present with significant psychopathology, I believe that upon his separation he would have been diagnosed with 'Adjustment Disorder mixed with depression and anxiety. I believe that the support he has received has been helpful and I encourage him to continue his personal growth.

[229] The evidence adduced in this trial fully  supports these findings about the respondent's personality  traits.

## [230] With respect to the claimant, Dr. Aubé wrote:

[The claimant's] psychological profile is more complex. Although she described strong bonding with her mother, it seems that her childhood harbours some level of insecurity. As a young child she witnessed an abusive relationship between her mother and her stepfather. It appears that often she has been her own protector as well as a protector of her mother. She explained in the course of this assessment that she knew that her mother had issues; I suspect that very young she knew that she only could count on herself. It seems that she did not have an easy start; life was demanding from the beginning.

Considering her background, I do not believe that [the claimant] ever opened her heart to any partnership. She is emotionally too fragile to take the risk of being damaged. Beyond a self -adequacy façade, with occasional bully displays, she hides well the intensity of her fragility. (There are profound pockets of insecurity within her personality. She is deep down a sad and anxious person who uses control to find reassurance. [The claimant] is quite an anxious person and becomes easily vulnerable when she feels unsupported or rejected. Similar to people who are raised in an environment colored with emotional instability,  [the claimant] perceives the outside world that is not 'under her control', 'as unsafe,' and as a source of permanent anxiety.

[The claimant] has also used anger to protect herself, especially when anxious. Because of her insecurity, she tends to perceive menaces when there are none. She did convey that she has been fighting battles that did

need to be fought. [The claimant] has given implicit messages to everyone close to her; she will only accept their unconditional support. B.A.M. and [the Child], both, are well aware that mom's love implies total support.

Clinically, [the claimant] meets also the criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder. Even though she can present as an assertive person, she is easily fearful of not being accepted and not being recognized. She tends to polarize people if they are on her side or against her. In  addition, her emotions become easily dysregulated when she feels threatened, rejected or abandoned. She can display a rapid shifting of a shallow expression of emotions. [The claimant] has very little insight; she has a hard time understanding that many of her behaviours have harmed her children and have distanced people from her. [The claimant] is also a fighter who can present herself with diligence, advocating for her rights and the welfare of her loved ones and can become forceful and easily abrasive when she feels that her rights are encroached upon.

Often [the claimant] misinterprets behaviour and responds defensively to criticism. [The claimant] is also a good manipulator, who can use guilt in order to have people follow her way.

Although she is an articulate woman with good potential, her self-esteem is poor. She needs strongly to be accepted and has a high need and a chronic thirst to be recognized and approved of. There is a distinct caring part to her that wants desperately to be accepted. As mentioned previously, she is easily frustrated, which very quickly manifests into argumentation and anger. Often, she deals with anxiety by substituting her anger.

Although, I have no doubt that [the claimant] dearly loves her children, it seems that often her attachment comes with conditions. She requires that her loved ones distinctly follow her agenda. Regrettably, I suspect that her children have perceived their mother's love as safe when they agree with their mother. This process has emotionally impaired [the Child]. It has created a certain level of ambivalence in respect to his affection towards his father.

I am of the opinion that [the claimant] has shared implicitly and explicitly with her children, especially B.A.M.,  her concerns and maybe also her dislike of [the respondent]. There has been a lack of clear boundaries of her personal feelings. Both children are clearly aware of mom's agenda.

[231] No evidence has been tendered to explain what  'the criteria for Borderline Personality  Disorder' means. The claimant believes that she is being accused of having  a 'serious mental  illness' and takes great exception to this 'diagnosis', if indeed that is what it is. In  any event,  I place no weight on this 'diagnosis', in the absence of evidence to explain it. The claimant's belief that Dr. Aubé has found her to have a 'serious mental illness' is not true.

[232] However, as I found  with Dr. Aubé's findings in respect of the respondent's personality,  I also conclude  that the evidence adduced in this trial amply supports Dr. Aubé's findings in respect of the claimant's personality  traits.

[233] With respect to the Child, Dr. Aubé opined:

[The Child] presents as a charming and intelligent 7 year old boy who is well aware of his parents' dissention. I do not believe that, since his parents' separation, [the Child] has been permitted to care for his father with the same intensity and flexibility  he used to, while his parents lived under the same roof. This situation has created a great deal of confusion and anxiety, which has been expressed through temper and considerable ambivalence. [The Child] presented as a confused child, verbally sharing preoccupations that were clearly inspired by his mom; while his behaviour reflected a safe relationship with his dad nevertheless. It is quite meaningful that both parents and several protagonists interviewed have related that since his parents' separation, [the Child] has expressed anger and has experienced some anxiety. [The Child], who reported that, before the separation between mom and dad, he was happy with dad, is clearly a harbinger that he had a strong relationship with his father before his parents separated.

[234] Overall,  Dr. Aubé opined that the Child needs parental care that  is stable, organized, predictable, nurturing  and child-centred.  He needs to be shielded from his parents' conflict.  He needs to feel his parents have accepted that  they both play an important role in his life. He needs to feel that he is permitted to love his father with the same intensity  and flexibility  he had before his parents' separation. He needs a safe home, free from emotional turbulence  and polarization.  In  this regard, Dr. Aubé opined that the Child had, to the point of the Report, 'received a great deal of messages not enforcing his attachment  towards the father,  which has created confusion  and apprehension'  (page 39). The evidence adduced in this trial fully supports this finding.

[235] Dr. Aubé went on to express that  the Child needs to have consistent boundaries and structure  from both parents, with the same system of rules and regulations  between them. He needs to be excluded  from his parents' conflict. He should  not be told or know about this litigation, the criminal investigation  process and other matters involving  his parents' separation. He needs to be able to love his father without  feeling he is betraying  his mother. He needs to continue  to perceive his father as a safe adult, who is able to nurture  him.

[236] Dr. Aubé quite correctly  observed that,  since the time of separation, things have been quite challenging.  She wrote 'I suspect that both [the  Child] and [B.A.M.] have been harmed. I am of the opinion that both children  would benefit from psychological  support' (page 40).

[237] Dr. Aubé  stressed that it would be in the best interest of the Child and [B.A.M.] for the parents to put aside their 'squabbles', align their parenting energy, improve their communication  and cooperation and use each other  as a resource.

[238] Dr. Aubé further  opined that the Child 'has been exposed to a great deal of polarization from his mother and has been privy  to adult  information regarding his parents' separation' (page 40). The evidence adduced in this trial supports this finding.

[239] Dr. Aubé went on to discuss the parents' abilities to endorse the Child's needs at pages 40 and 41. She described that both parents love the Child, he loves them and that,  before their separation, the Child had a safe attachment  to them both.

[240] Dr. Aubé is of the view that both parents appear to be able to attend to the Child's physical  needs, that they  are both nurturing  and caring persons and have excellent  resources to offer the Child. Both parents, but more so the claimant,  have been promoting creativity.  However,  Dr. Aubé further  found  that there had been a lack of 'clear boundaries' and that both parents had shared with the Child personal feelings about the other parent. Dr. Aubé  observed that  the claimant had not provided the respondent with information  with respect to the Child's health, education and extracurricular  activities. She also observed that the respondent's unresolved  issues and emotional instability hinder his parenting abilities and that the respondent  did not shield the children  from his anxiety  when  his partnership with the claimant broke down. She also observed that the claimant has, at times, interfered with the respondent's parenting time. Dr. Aubé also observed that the claimant had shared, implicitly and explicitly,  with both the Child and B.A.M. her concerns and 'maybe also her dislike' of the respondent,  which has been harmful  for both children. She has not encouraged B.A.M. to foster the relationship  he had with the respondent.  B.A.M.'s decision to distance from the respondent  is, in essence, an act

of proving loyalty  toward his mother.  This has threatened  the Child's attachment  to his father.

[241] Once again, all of these findings are amply supported by the evidence in this trial.

[242] Dr. Aubé set out her conclusions  and recommendations  from pages 41 through  45 of the Report. She first discussed the harm caused to the Child since the time of separation. She wrote at page 40:

As mentioned previously, [the Child] has been exposed, for the past 1.5 years, to his parents' conflict, resulting in a high level of stress for this boy. Although, I am very concerned by the fact that this child has been subjected to a campaign of polarization, I am even more preoccupied with the explicit and implicit messages [the Child] has received from his mother. As mentioned previously, it is my opinion that [the claimant] has not fostered and encouraged a relationship between [the Child] and his dad. I also believe that to a certain degree she has been promoting her child's suspiciousness towards his father and consequently creating an emotional distance. This aspect has greatly harmed [the Child].

- [243] The evidence adduced in this trial fully  supports these opinions.

[244] Dr. Aubé then discussed her recommendations.  In recommending  equal parenting,  she wrote:

This being said, and putting aside the atmosphere of polarization, I am confident that [the claimant] loves and cares deeply for her children. I am also confident that the relationship between [the Child] and his father has solid roots. Although recent times have been stormier, I hope that with psychological help and quality time with his father, [the Child] will rebuild an even stronger relationship with his dad.

Even though [the claimant] questioned some of [the respondent's] parenting abilities, I have every j reason to believe that he is an adequate parent. [The Respondent] has the hallmark of a caring loving father. This said, I do believe that he needs to be aware of his anxiety when upset and abstain from sharing anxiety with his son.

If verbally  [the Child] expressed a stronger desire to be with mom, nonverbally he gave an explicit message that he is comfortable and well attached to his father. As mentioned, [the Child's] ambivalence regarding his desire to be with his dad is the result of a campaign of polarization. [The Child's] opinion is clearly tributary to the family dynamic.

Despite a great deal of inconsistencies, both parents were able to provide me with enough information regarding their respective attachments to their child.

In the process of this assessment, [The claimant] and [the respondent] have given me enough guarantees that they care for their child. It is also clear that both parents have a great deal of resources to offer [the Child]. Therefore, with the essential conclusion that both parents have, generally speaking, the best interests of their child at heart, I would like to recommend that both parents equally share the guardianship of [the Child]. This child has 2 biological parents who have good potential and excellent resources. It would be ill-advised not to permit [the Child] to benefit from the potential of each parent. It would also be a wrong message to give to this young boy, to have only one parent as sole guardian; both parents have an array of assets that he should be exposed to. [The claimant] and [the respondent] both should make sound and joint decisions about this child's education, healthcare, religion and extracurricular activities. Both parents should be involved in every aspect of their child's life. They should share equally their parenting responsibilities. This said, given the polarization and restrictions made on [the respondent's] parenting time over the last 1.5 years, I recommend strongly that if both parents cannot agree on a matter related to [the Child], [the respondent] has the final decision. I do not believe that he will interfere with [the claimant's] ability to parent [the Child], although I wouldn't be surprised if the contrary was attempted.

[245] Dr. Aubé later appealed to the claimant to reflect upon her recommendations, writing:

[The claimant] has to understand that the welfare of [the Child] depends greatly on her ability to remain neutral, and to permit her son to love his father. Although [the claimant] may disagree in some ways with the clinical formulation and some of my recommendations, I urge her to reflect on and then review her perceptions, as well as her approach to coparenting.

[246] Dr. Aubé then went on to recommend that  if there were no significant change on the claimant's part in the near future,  that the respondent  seek sole guardianship of the Child. She expressed optimism, however,  that  this would not be necessary. She wrote:

[e]verything tells me that in the course of this assessment, [the claimant] has been more cognizant than ever, that she needs to promote [the Child's] relationship with his father and to assist [B.A.M.] to reconcile and catch up on the relationship he had with [the respondent].

[247] Dr. Aubé also recommended that the Child, who has been 'badly bruised' by his parents' separation, would benefit from psychological  help.

[248] In  the end, Dr. Aubé recommended that  the parties share parenting responsibilities and parenting time with the Child, if the claimant changed her

behaviour.  If  she did not, Dr. Aubé recommended that the respondent  seek sole guardianship.  She strongly  encouraged all of the adult participants in this case to not disclose or even discuss, implicitly or explicitly,  the Report with the Child and B.A.M. She expressed the further  strong hope that both parents would  see each other as 'an important resource that  will enhance  their child's life in a complimentary  fashion' (page 45).

[249] Unfortunately,  Dr. Aubé's hope that the claimant had, throughout  the course of the assessment process and upon reflection of the contents  of the Report, become more aware of her need to promote the Child's relationship with his father and to assist B.A.M. in reconciling with him, did not come to fruition.  In  fact, things got much worse.

[250] The claimant was dissatisfied with certain aspects of the Report and filed a complaint to her professional governing  body. The claimant  then contacted another psychologist,  Dr. Ginter. She worked with Dr. Ginter, commencing  in April 2016, for the next six months.  Her treatment  plan for 'depressive situational  disorder' with Dr. Ginter revolved  primarily around 'self-care',  as the claimant described it.

[251] Meanwhile,  Ms. Ballance continued to provide support to the claimant  and the Child. For example, on April 15, 2016, Ms. Ballance was present in the claimant's home when the Child left for parenting time with the respondent.  Unlike many  of the other exchanges,  this one went fairly well.  While the Child indicated some initial reluctance  to go with his father,  he eventually  did so after some encouragement  by his mother.  The Child left the claimant's home without  any  of the emotional upset that had up to that  point become so common.

[252] On April 22, 2016, the claimant's second lawyer,  Mr. Christianson, filed a Notice of Intention  to Withdraw as Lawyer. The claimant's contact information  was listed on this notice. It included the claimant's telephone  number,  her Whistler  Drive address, and her personal email address. This remains the claimant's email address today.

[253] On April 26, 2016, the respondent  filed another application seeking, among other things,  a determination of his earlier adjourned  application to have  the family residence listed for sale and sold, that the Child attend counselling,  several Conduct Orders, and that the recommendations  of Dr. Aubé for equally  shared parenting responsibilities and parenting time be implemented on an interim basis.

[254] On April 28, 2016, the claimant was personally  served with her lawyer's Notice of Intention  to Withdraw as Lawyer.

[255] In  late April 2016, the claimant moved from her Whistler  Drive condominium to another  rental accommodation on Pacific Way. She did not inform the respondent of her change of address as the November 10, 2015 Orders required her to do.

[256] When asked why she failed to comply with this Court Order, the claimant provided several answers. At first she said she was not aware she 'had to fill that out through  the court registry'.  When pressed, she reluctantly  agreed there was an Order made that she was to keep the respondent apprised of her residential address, testifying that  there 'could have been' such an Order.

[257] The claimant also acknowledged that the respondent had been asking her where she had moved with the Child at the time. She explained that her refusal to provide that information  to the respondent  was owing to the discomfort she felt from the 'stalking'.  I can only infer this is a reference to the respondent's conduct  in the spring and summer of 2014. However,  a short time later in her evidence, the claimant changed her answer. She testified that she did in fact inform the respondent  of her new Pacific Way address. When pressed for details of how she communicated this information,  the claimant testified that  it 'would  have been' by email. She could not point to any  evidence in support of this contention.  Once again, the claimant's answers to these questions demonstrate not only  her attitude toward compliance with Court Orders, but her very  tenuous  relationship with the truth.

[258] Ms. Christianson,  shortly  to get off the record, filed the claimant's Response to Application on May 4, 2016. The claimant sought to adjourn  most of the applications. Ms. Christianson's Notice of Withdrawal  was filed the following  day.

[259] On May 11, 2016, with another lawyer  appearing with the claimant as a 'friend of the court',  the respondent's application proceeded in part. Madam Justice Hyslop made a number of Orders (the 'May 11, 2016 Orders'). The court adjourned the respondent's applications in regard to parenting time and responsibilities and ordered the family  residence be listed for sale and sold under  certain terms, including  terms that required the claimant's cooperation. The court also granted the following  Conduct Orders:

8. No party is to discuss the contents of the report made by Dr. Nicole Aubé dated April 1, 2016 with the Child;

…

10. The parties will:
2. (a) Put the best interests of the Child before their own interests;
3. (b) Encourage the Child to have a good relationship with the other parent and speak to the Child about the other parent in a positive and respectful manner;
4. (c) Make a real effort to maintain polite, respectful communications with each other, refraining from any negative or hostile critiscism, communication or argument in front of the Child, nor shall they allow the other person to do so.
11. The parties shall not discuss these proceedings with the Child, nor shall they discuss the circumstances of the breakdown of the parties' relationship with the Child, or in his presence, nor shall they allow any other person to do so.

[260] Madam Justice Hyslop adjourned  the balance of the relief sought  to a date no later than June 30, 2016, in order for the claimant to retain new counsel.  The claimant was present in court that day and heard the May 11, 2016 Orders as they were imposed.

[261] Following the May 11, 2016 Orders, the respondent tried to communicate with the claimant about the selection of a realtor and a listing price for the family

residence. The claimant did not respond, other than to say 'I'll  be appealing'. The claimant did not appeal any of the May 11, 2016 Orders.

[262] In  May 2016, the Ministry and ICS professionals involved  with this family felt it important to engage the parents in a planning,  or integrated case, meeting. The goal of the meeting was to develop a plan to assist them with their ongoing conflict  and to assist the Child with his anxiety,  particularly  around  the escalation of his negative behaviours  at the parenting time exchanges.  The Ministry  and ICS professionals felt that such a meeting with both parents present might be best. The respondent  was open to such a meeting, but the claimant was not. To accommodate her concerns, two separate meetings were arranged to be held on the same day - one with the claimant and the other with the respondent.

[263] As planned,  this integrated case meeting occurred in two parts on May 31, 2016. The respondent's meeting occurred in the morning  and the claimant's in the afternoon.  Present at the meetings were Ms. Lubin, Mr. Doll (the ICS program coordinator), Ms. Pater, Ms. Ballance, Mr. Reedman and perhaps another  social worker. Mr. Reedman,  Ms. Ballance and Ms. Lubin were consistent  in their recollections of their meeting with the respondent.  That meeting went well. The respondent  was receptive to any help available, was willing to listen and was willing to consider his parenting critically.  He was not defensive or hostile.

[264] The claimant's meeting did not go as well.  As a result  of a previous commitment, Mr. Reedman was only present for the first portion of this meeting. Ms. Ballance and Ms. Lubin were consistent  in their recollections that  the claimant was quite confrontational  throughout  the meeting, resistant to suggestions and resistant to accepting feedback. Her attitude was described by Ms. Lubin as 'snarky', 'sarcastic', or 'aggressive'. The formulation  of a community  service plan to assist in providing support to the claimant and the Child proved difficult,  but the claimant was open to Mr. Reedman's involvement.

[265] As a result  of the May 31, 2016 meetings, those involved  decided it would be best for the family to have one support worker rather than  two. Ms. Ballance, who had been working well with the claimant,  was chosen.

[266] On June 3, 2016, due to the claimant's lack of cooperation on the sale of the family residence, the respondent  was forced to file an application with the court seeking Orders to have a listing price fixed and the claimant's approvals dispensed with. On June 8, 2016, Master McDiarmid endorsed these Orders.

[267] The respondent  sought other Orders on June 8, 2016. Although  found to have been properly served, the claimant did not appear at this hearing. Duty  counsel appeared at one point during the hearing to advise the court that the claimant was 'in emergency',  but the hearing proceeded.

[268] On June 8, 2016, Master McDiarmid made 23 Interim  Orders varying  earlier Orders and adding additional ones regarding parenting of the Child. These Orders included implementation  of the changes recommended by Dr. Aubé , such as equally  shared parenting time and equally  shared parenting responsibilities, with the respondent  having final decision-making authority  if the parties failed to reach agreement. Very specific parenting terms were set out. Child support was varied to reflect the shared parenting arrangement.  The Child was to attend counselling  (the 'June 8, 2016 Orders').

[269] The court also ordered that a copy of the June 8, 2016 Orders and any  other legal process could be served upon the claimant as an attachment  to an email, at the claimant's email address on file. Her email address on file was, and remains, the claimant's correct email address.

[270] At trial, the claimant was asked about her non-attendance  that day. She acknowledged that she knew it was an important day in that the respondent was seeking equally  shared parenting time and other Orders that would change the Child's current  arrangements.  She testified that she became quite ill that morning. She went to a walk-in  clinic, but found the wait list was too long. She went to the

hospital. She called a friend at the courthouse  to ask if the application could be heard in the afternoon.  The claimant provided no details of her illness, nor  were any medical records or other evidence adduced. The claimant did not apply to set aside any of the June 8, 2016 Orders.

[271] I  do not accept the claimant's evidence that she was medically incapable of attending court on June 8, 2016. Her credibility was undermined  a number of times in this trial. I will provide a particularly  significant example where the claimant was shown to have been untruthful  in an Affidavit and then,  in attempting to explain away that untruth,  was untruthful  to the court.

[272] In  an Affidavit sworn  November 17, 2016, the claimant deposed that she had 'not received any correspondence from the opposing counsel,  Rachael Lammers, Morelli Chertkow LLP, since June 8, 2016'. The claimant filed this Affidavit in support of her unsuccessful  adjournment  application brought the day before the commencement of this trial. The evidence establishes that,  contrary  to her Affidavit, many emails with attachments  containing letters,  Court Orders, applications and the like, were sent by Ms. Lammers' office to the claimant's email address after June  8, 2016.

[273] When confronted with this untruth,  the claimant changed her evidence. She acknowledged that she had, in fact, received emails from Ms. Lammers' office after June 8, 2016, but said that she could not open the attachments  that came with those emails. This further  untruth  was exposed when the claimant was confronted  with an email sent to her by Ms. Lammers' office on June 17, 2016.

[274] Ms. Lammers' assistant emailed the claimant on June 17, 2016. The email attached a letter to the claimant from Ms. Lammers. The claimant replied to this email from her email address. She was clearly  able to open the attachment  to this email because she responded to the contents of the attachment.  Once again, clearly caught  in an untruth,  the claimant was pressed to explain.  She could not. At first, the claimant expressed confusion,  testifying 'all I can say is I wasn't getting the emails with attachments'.  When  it was pointed out that her email to Ms. Lammers' assistant

was responsive to the content  of the attachment,  the claimant then offered that  she had 'heard' about the order regarding the sale of the family  residence through  a person at the courthouse.  The person was not named. It is clear this response was contrived.

[275] I  might add that, even if were to accept that  the claimant was unable  to open any of the attachments  to the emails sent by Ms. Lammers' office (which  I do not),  it is noteworthy  that the emails had subject  lines. These subject  lines indicated that  the attachment  or attachments  contained Court Orders and other information  pertaining to the ongoing litigation. Particularly  with a looming trial date of which the claimant was aware, one would reasonably  expect that if she were actually  unable to open these attachments  as she claims, she would  have contacted Ms. Lammers' office to resolve the problem and/or taken steps to obtain the information.  The claimant did none of the set things.

[276] I  am satisfied that the claimant simply opted to ignore the correspondence from Ms. Lammers' office. As with the litigation involving  Mr. Paul's outstanding  bill (and as will be seen with proceedings involving  her eviction from the Pacific Way address and the Ministry  litigation in Provincial Court), from June 8, 2016 forward, the claimant simply declined to participate in this litigation. It was not until a few days before trial that she opted to participate.

[277] In  any event,  the claimant's sworn  evidence that she received no correspondence from Ms. Lammers' office after June 8, 2016 has been established to be untrue.  Her various explanations  to this court have also been established to be untrue.

[278] The claimant was aware of the June 8, 2016 Orders. Order #17 specifically required the parties to make decisions about the Child's participation in extracurricular  activities jointly,  with the respondent's decision to prevail if no agreement was reached. This was a variation of the November 10, 2015 Order that required the parties to consult  with one another  before enrolling  the children in any extracurricular  activities outside of swimming or baseball. The claimant was aware of

the November 10, 2015 Order as well.  Nevertheless,  the claimant still registered the Child in hockey without  consulting  or speaking to the respondent.

[279] The respondent  learned of the claimant's unilateral  decision to enrol the Child in hockey on June 23, 2016. Their email exchange  on this topic appears at Exhibit 13:

## [ The respondent ]:

I just found out [the Child] is registered in hockey.

As per Master McDiarmid's Order, dated 2016-06-08, paragraph 17, indicates decisions affecting [the Child's] participation in extracurricular activities shall be made jointly.

I am open to having that discussion now; however, in the future, please discuss prior to registering him.

## Thank you.

## [ The claimant ]:

It's going to be a long haul for [the Child] if you keep this up, [the respondent].

## [ The respondent ];

Just asking that there be discussion before decisions are made concerning [the Child]. His parents cooperating is what is in his best interest.

## [ The claimant ]:

You weren't 'just asking'. You're hiding behind an order like a coward. You have really turned into one of the most awful human beings I have ever encountered.

## [ The respondent ]:

I am not even going to get into why that order is there in the first place.

[The Child] wants nothing more than for his family to be back together. Though we can not give him that, we can show him we can cooperate and make decisions together.

The ball is in your court, [the claimant]. Make the right decision and parent [the Child] with me.

## [ The claimant ]:

Because of you. That's why it's in place. You're absolutely crazy. What happened to you?

I wanted it easy for [the Child] from the beginning but you seem to have forgotten that. You seemed more interested in slandering me than being a parent and giving him what he needs.

[280] This example highlights  the profound  difference in the parties' approaches to one another  and to co-parenting.  It is an example of the respondent's conciliatory, cooperative approach, even in the face of the claimant's failure to comply with a Court Order. It  is an example of the claimant's demeaning and confrontational approach to the respondent and her obvious disdain for Court Orders. Her registering the Child in hockey, even if it occurred before the June 8, 2016 Orders, was still contrary  to the November  10, 2015 Orders.

[281] The family residence sold within days of the June 8 Order. I will return  to the respondent's difficulties thereafter  in securing the claimant's cooperation with any aspect of the sale process.

[282] The claimant did engage with Mr. Reedman for a time. Mr. Reedman met with the claimant on June 15, 2016 for approximately  an hour.  He described that the claimant was 'hesitant'  at first. She expressed her concerns  with the Ministry  and her belief that the respondent  would not be engaging in the therapeutic  process. However, it was Mr. Reedman's impression that the claimant  soon became open and engaged. Thereafter,  most of their contact was over email. Over the next  month, their exchanges were quite open. They  discussed parenting approaches, communication strategies and the Child's anxiety  near and at the transition times. Mr. Reedman made suggestions about how the claimant might handle  those challenges.  The claimant's actions suggested to Mr. Reedman that she was perhaps not receptive to his suggestions. She did not appear to put his suggestions into play. Unfortunately,  by the end of July  2016, the claimant ceased communications  with Mr. Reedman almost entirely.

[283] Mr. Reedman also met with the respondent  in June  2016. They  discussed many of the same topics. The respondent  thereafter  continued  to utilize Mr. Reedman as a resource, to the present day. The respondent was receptive to Mr. Reedman's suggestions on parenting and communication approaches. Mr. Reedman described the respondent as 'reflective'  in his parenting and very receptive to help. Mr. Reedman acknowledges that he spent more time with the

respondent  than the claimant during the months of June and July,  but this was largely  because the respondent  sought him out for assistance.

[284] The claimant and the children only  lived at the Pacific Way address until the end of July  2016. They  lived there for such a short time because, on June 28, 2016, the claimant's landlord  obtained judgment  against her for unpaid rent in the amount of $1,887.30, as well as an Eviction Order. The claimant had been served with the landlord's application in this regard, but did not attend the hearing on June  28, 2016 in front of an adjudicator at the Residential Tenancy  Branch.

[285] The claimant's landlord then  obtained a Writ of Possession from a Registrar of this Court on July  11, 2016, which allowed him to enter the claimant's rental unit, take possession of it and seize and sell any of her personal goods and chattels to realize his cost associated with executing  the Writ. The claimant moved out near the end of July.  She advises that her debt has now been paid.

[286] The claimant explained that she did not attend the June 28 hearing because she had 'no idea' it occurred.  When pressed for details, she provided an explanation that defies logic. She did not plainly deny  receiving the Notice of Hearing, but rather suggested that she overlooked it. She testified that the landlord had left an envelope for her on the counter  one day, but that they  both had become distracted by the landlord's efforts to fix a leak in the rental unit.  She explained that she left the envelope,  unopened,  on the counter  until  the landlord  called her about it, approximately  a week later. She denied being served with the Writ of Possession, yet did admit to moving out around that timeframe.

[287] The claimant was unable  to explain why  she was unable to afford to pay her rent during this time. Her rent was only slightly  higher than she had been paying at Whistler Drive. In response to a direct question on this topic, she testified that she was 'unable  to come up with an answer at this time'.

[288] After leaving the Pacific Way condominium,  the claimant moved in with her father.  She lived with him until  October 1, 2016. Again, the claimant did not provide

the respondent with notice of her new address in accordance with the  November 10, 2015 Orders.

[289] The equally  shared parenting time arrangement  ordered on June 8, 2016 was not in place for long.  The exchanges  continued to go poorly.  The claimant says she continued  to encourage the Child to go with his father,  but his resistance remained considerable. His anxiety  and extreme emotional responses only  intensified.

[290] The Child's first full  week with his father  in accordance with the shared parenting time arrangement  commenced on June 14, 2016. The respondent  picked up the Child from school and the balance of their week together went well.  On the weekend, they  went to Whistler for a Father's Day event and had a good time together.  The Child was happy. He was returned  to the claimant's home on June 21, 2016 for her week of parenting  time.

[291] The respondent's next  parenting week was to commence on June 28, 2016. The exchange on this day did not go well. The respondent  had to involve  the RCMP. The Child had not gone to school that  day, so the respondent  could not pick him up there. He did not want to use the RCMP, but felt he had no choice. The respondent waited outside the claimant's residence and had a number of communications  with her and with Mr. Reedman to try and work on a way to reduce the Child's emotional upset. The RCMP officer went into the claimant's residence and came outside with the Child. The Child appeared happy and content.  No force had been used to remove him from the claimant's home or to put him in the respondent's vehicle.

[292] In  accordance with the June 8, 2016 Orders, the respondent  had the Child in his care for the next  11 or 12 days. They  had a very  good time together.  They  went to the respondent's  parents' residence close to a lake, participated in the Canada Day Parade, played and generally  spent positive time together. The respondent returned  the Child to the claimant's care on July  12, for her two weeks of parenting time.

[293] On July  14, 2016, the respondent was compelled to go back to court over the claimant's lack of cooperation with the family residence sale process and her lack of financial disclosure. He filed an application on this day seeking a vesting order, orders for document  production and an Order that the court execute documents  on behalf of the claimant, among other things.

[294] On July  19, 2016, a meeting was held at the Ministry office. At the end of the meeting, the Child came into the room where the adults, including  the respondent, had been. Mr. Reedman saw the Child sit on the respondent's lap and chat openly. The respondent  reassured the Child. Once reassured and feeling safe, the Child moved away from the respondent to interact with others. Mr. Reedman described this as an example of a healthy  attachment  relationship.

[295] On July  26, 2016, the parties met at the Travel  Centre near an RCMP detachment to transfer  the Child from the claimant to the respondent.  This exchange caused yet another  dramatic turn  of events  for the Child.

[296] I  will  start with the claimant's version of events.  The claimant testified that she brought  the Child to the Travel  Centre by car that morning.  The Child refused to go with his father.  He cried, he locked the car doors and he begged not to go. The claimant verbally  tried to convince  him. The respondent  got out of his vehicle at one point and banged on the window of the claimant's car. He told the Child to get out of the car. The claimant rolled her window down a little and told the respondent  that she was 'working on it'. The claimant says that she then  got 'firm' with the Child and got upset with him. The Child replied 'Fine, you don't love me', got out of the car and started to run.  The claimant then  observed the respondent chasing the Child around the vehicle as the Child was saying he did not want  to go with him. The claimant began to record this activity on her cellular  telephone.

[297] The claimant further  testified that  the respondent  saw her recording them  and he took the phone out of her hand. He gave it back to her. He continued  to chase the Child. When  he eventually  caught  the Child, the claimant alleges that the respondent spanked the Child seven or eight times, and threw him  into his vehicle while the

Child screamed. They  drove away. The claimant immediately texted Ms. Lubin. She then  called the Ministry emergency  line and reported this event.  She then spoke with Ms. Lubin and reported her concerns.  She told Ms. Lubin she would share the video recording she had made of the event,  but she has not done so, later claiming that the respondent must have  deleted the recording.

[298] The respondent  denies spanking or otherwise striking the Child during this exchange.  The respondent  testified that the Child came over to his truck at the exchange point and told him, as he had many times in the recent past, that he did not want to go with his father.  The respondent told the Child that they  had been through  this before and that the Child is required to go with him. The Child then went back to the claimant's vehicle  and got inside. He saw them talking. The respondent then  got out of his vehicle and tried to open the back door of the claimant's vehicle, where the Child was sitting. The claimant was in the front seat. The claimant told him not to touch  her car. He went back to his truck.

[299] The respondent  testified that the Child came over to his vehicle again and told him again that he was not going to go with him. The Child then  ran around  the back of the respondent's  truck. The respondent  got out and noticed that  the claimant was recording what was occurring.  He grabbed her phone and walked to the back of her vehicle.  She got out.  He gave her phone back, picked up the Child and put him in the back of his truck and left. The Child was lashing out and striking at the respondent  as he held him. The respondent denies spanking, striking or doing anything  physical to the Child other than picking him up to put him in his truck.

[300] The respondent  further  testified that when  he drove home with the Child, he received a call from the Ministry.  He said he would call back when  he got home. When he got home, the Child immediately went up to his bedroom. The respondent then  went onto his front  porch and called Ms. Lubin. He told her what happened. Ms. Lubin asked him if he spanked the Child and he denied doing so. He told Ms. Lubin that the claimant appeared to have been recording the entire incident and asked her

to obtain the video recording as he was confident it would verify  his version of events.  He has never  seen that recording. He denies deleting it or any portion of it.

[301] Ministry  officials immediately investigated.  Within approximately  three or four hours,  Ms. Lubin and another  social worker attended the respondent's home. They interviewed the Child in the absence of the respondent.

[302] Ms. Lubin described the Child as very anxious.  He appeared emotionally distressed. He pulled at his hair, dragged his hands repeatedly  through  the carpet and was seen to stare blankly.  Through  the use of non-leading  questions, the Child told Ms. Lubin and the other social worker that his father picked him up, put him in the truck and locked the door. He said he was never  hit by his father.  He said he was kicking or wiggling his legs when  the respondent  was holding him. In short,  the Child's version  is entirely  consistent with the respondent's. I accept their version is true. The  Child's next  disclosure was quite unexpected.

[303] The Child told the social workers that he and his mother  had come up with a 'plan' over breakfast that morning  to allow him to get out of going with his father. The plan was that they  would go to the exchange point, that the Child would be upset, cry and tell the respondent he did not want to go. The claimant would record him doing these things  and then show police the recording as evidence.

[304] The Child expressed concern  to the social workers that the 'plan' did not work because he was unable to cry as he was told to do. He was worried about what his mother was thinking.  He was concerned about staying with his father because he was worried about how his mother felt because the 'plan' did not work out.

[305] The claimant contends  that Ms. Lubin and the other social worker contrived this information.  This contention  is without  merit. Ms. Lubin and the other social worker would  have no reason to do so. The Child volunteered  this information.  He had no reason to contrive this information.  I find that the Child volunteered  this information  because it is exactly  what  happened that day.

[306] Ministry  officials continued  to investigate.

[307] On July  28, 2016, Ms. Lubin and Ms. Washbrook interviewed B.A.M. This interview  revealed that  the claimant had discussed matters with B.A.M. that  no parent should ever share with a child. B.A.M. related that  he and his mother discussed the breakdown of her relationship  with the respondent,  including  his mother's view that the respondent  continues  to 'stalk' her.  B.A.M. also disclosed having  read the Report. He was aware of some of Dr. Aubé's specific opinions and recommendations, expressing disagreement with some of those opinions and recommendations. B.A.M. also shared his knowledge of the ongoing court process, offering his opinion that the claimant and the Child had been 'screwed over' by the process. He also thought  it unfair that  the respondent  took the family  residence and that the Child had no choice about whether  to see his father.

[308] I  am satisfied the events  of July  26, 2016 unfolded as described by the Child and the respondent.  I am also satisfied the claimant shared information with B.A.M. as he described.

[309] Faced with all of this startling  information,  Ms. Lubin consulted  her supervisor. Ministry  officials decided a safety plan was needed for B.A.M. B.A.M. was to stay with R.P. and E.P. and have supervised time with the claimant. The safety  plan took effect on July  29, 2016. It had the following  requirements:

1. No adult conversation with [B.A.M.] regarding conflict with [the respondent] or MCFD's current involvement;
2. [B.A.M.] is to remain at [R.P.] and [E.P.'s] residence until further planning with MCFD occurs;
3. [The claimant] is to be supervised with [B.A.M.] until further planning with MCFD occurs;
4. [B.A.M.] is to be transported to Victoria by [R.P.] and [the claimant] can be present;
5. [B.A.M.] is to return to the home of {R.P.] and [E.P.] unless advised differently by MCFD.

[310] With respect to the Child, Ministry  officials decided to seek a Protective Intervention  Order ('PIO')  pursuant  to s. 28 of the Child, Family and Community Service Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 46 [ CFCSA ] to prohibit the claimant from contact with the Child.

[311] On August 2, 2016, Madam Justice Hyslop  heard the respondent's applications to dispense with the claimant's participation in the family residence sale process and to compel financial disclosure from the claimant.  The claimant did not attend this hearing.

[312] Among other things,  the court ordered that a Registrar of the Court execute any document necessary to facilitate the transfer  of the family  residence in accordance with the Contract of Purchase and Sale, pursuant  to s. 38 of the Law and Equity Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 253. As well, the court ordered the claimant  to produce, within seven days of the delivery  of the Order, a number  of documents pertaining to her financial disclosure obligations (the 'August 2, 2016 Orders').  With these August 2, 2016 Orders in place, the sale of the family residence could finally complete. It completed all without  the claimant's participation.

[313] The family residence sold for $446,000.00. After adjustments,  the balance of $430,092.33 was placed in trust with the respondent's counsel.  From those funds, the outstanding  mortgage ($339,813.67), Mr. Paul's judgment  against the claimant ($3,843.21), outstanding  property taxes and utilities ($6,072.55), meter reading to the City of Kamloops ($742.02), payout of costs to the respondent  as per the August 2, 2016 Orders ($2,500.00) and payment  of the account  of Morelli Chertkow LLP for the sale ($850.00) were all paid out on August 2, 2016. As of that date, $76,270.88 remained held in trust.  These fund have  earned a small amount  of interest since that time.

[314] On August 3, 2016, the claimant appeared in Provincial Court, with duty counsel,  for the Ministry's application for a PIO. The claimant sought  an adjournment to seek legal counsel.  An adjournment  was granted until August  24, 2016 and, by consent,  the court ordered on an interim, without  prejudice basis, that the claimant be prohibited from 'contacting  or interfering  with or trying  to contact or interfere with [the Child]' or from 'entering  any premises or vehicle or boarding any vessel that [the Child] attends until  August  24, 2016, or until  further  Order of the court'.  Similar interim, without  prejudice, Orders were made prohibiting the claimant from residing

with the Child or entering  any residence of the Child.  The court further  ordered that any police officer is authorized  to arrest the claimant without  a warrant  if the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that she has contravened  or is contravening  the PIO. The  PIO itself highlights  that 'disobeying this Order is a criminal offence under s. 127 of the Criminal Code punishable by fine or imprisonment'.

[315] On August 8, 2016, Mr. Reedman emailed the claimant to advise her that he would be starting one-on-one  counselling  with the Child. Mr. Reedman continued  to keep the claimant informed, in a fairly  detailed and respectful  way, over email. She often replied, usually  expressing her displeasure at what decisions were being made without  her input.

[316] On August 10, 2016, Mr. Reedman had his first counselling  session with the Child. He saw him again on August  23, and then  several more times at his school up until  the time of trial. By their September 19, 2016 session, Mr. Reedman observed that the Child's anxiety  symptoms had reduced quite a bit. He attributed this to the familiarity of being with his father  on a regular  basis. The Child did not speak to Mr. Reedman much about his relationship with either parent. Mr. Reedman explained that he sensed that  the Child is mindful  of the 'divide' between his parents and does not want to appear to support one over the other.  He did express missing his mother.

[317] On August 19, 2016, the safety plan regarding the claimant's contact with B.A.M. changed.  One condition was added:

[The claimant] shall ensure [B.A.M.]  is not exposed to any adult conversation regarding [the respondent] or [the Child], court-related matters and prior/current MCFD involvement.

[318] On August 24, 2016, the claimant appeared in Provincial Court regarding the PIO application. Again, the claimant appeared with duty  counsel and sought an adjournment  to obtain counsel.  By consent,  the matter was adjourned  to September 7, 2016. The interim, without  prejudice, Orders previously  made were ordered to carry on until  September 7, 2016, or further  order of the court.

[319] Commencing on August 27, 2016, the respondent arranged for the Child to stay with R.P. and E.P. for a couple of nights to facilitate a visit between B.A.M. and the Child. Unbeknownst  to the Ministry  or the respondent,  the claimant recorded a video message from herself to the Child. The claimant convinced  R.P. to play the video message to the Child and give the Child gifts (a teddy bear and books) she sent along with the message.

[320] R.P. and the claimant both acknowledge this was a breach of the August 24, 2016 PIOs.  R.P. viewed the video message from the claimant and described it as a short message where the claimant told the Child that she loved him, that he was a strong boy, that he should  keep up the good work, that she would see him again, but she was unsure  when.  She told the Child that she would be looking forward to the day that she could see him again. R.P. showed the Child the video. He also passed along the gifts.

[321] R.P. told the respondent about this video message after it was viewed by the Child. R.P. knew the respondent  would inform the Ministry,  so R.P. decided to call Ms. Lubin first. R.P. had an open discussion with Ms. Lubin about what had occurred. He understood  that what he had done was considered a breach of the PIO. The  RCMP investigated, but R.P. declined to cooperate. When asked why  he declined to cooperate with police, he testified that he wanted all of this 'to stop'. He believed that the claimant did not need any 'additional stressors' and that the respondent  'should lay off the gas pedal'. Although  a clear breach of the PIO,  no criminal charges were brought  against the claimant.

[322] Since this time, B.A.M. has refused to visit with his brother.  He made this choice as a show of solidarity with his mother.  Clearly B.A.M. has been advised of court-related  matters involving  the Child.

[323] The claimant believes the respondent  has manipulated the Ministry  into furthering  his vendetta  against her. The Ministry  application for a PIO is, she says, evidence of his manipulation.  The evidence does not support such a conclusion.  The respondent  simply chose to engage and work with Ministry  officials during these

difficult times. While both parties perhaps called the Ministry  at times when  they should  not have,  there is no evidence to suggest the respondent used his contact with Ministry officials and the services he accessed into furthering  any sort of agenda. I find the respondent  was genuinely  interested in improving his parenting skills to appropriately address the Child's needs. He did improve his parenting skills and is appropriately addressing the Child's needs.

[324] Throughout  the early stages of the Ministry's application for a PIO, Ms. Lubin attempted to arrange meetings or have conversations  with the claimant.  The claimant consistently  advised her that she would not have meetings with Ministry officials without  her lawyer present.  Ms. Lubin asked for the name of her lawyer  so that meetings and conversations  might occur, but the claimant has not responded to those requests.

[325] Even with the imposition of the interim, without  prejudice,  PIOs, the claimant continued  to be obstructionist  in her dealings with the respondent.

[326] For example,  on September 5, 2016, the respondent emailed the claimant to ask for the Child's hockey equipment. The  claimant replied, 'I had to buy his gear last year without  any help from you. Guess you're in the same boat'. He replied, 'Just wanted to see what  still fit him and what  needed to be purchased. Seems like a waste to have this perfectly  good equipment sitting there, unused.  This is for [the Child]'. The claimant refused.

[327] On September 19, 2016, the claimant  was served with the respondent's Notice to Admit (Exhibit 25). She did not respond. Therefore,  the following  facts in relation to family assets and debt are deemed to be admitted. The facts are these:

1. The parties had, at the date of their separation on November 7 th , 2014 the following assets and debts, having the following values, and were retained by the specified party following separation as follows (Former Family Residence and mortgage excluded):

| Eye glasses (cost net of insurance coverage)  | September 13, 2016         |    47.97 |
| Trampoline registration fee and membershipfee | September 12, 2016         |   225.87 |

10. Each of the expenses listed in paragraph 9 are 'special and extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of s. 7 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines.
11. [The Child] has been residing exclusively with the Respondent since July 26, 2016 when he was removed from the Claimant's care by the Ministry for Children and Families.
12. [The Child] will have the following expenses into the future:
- a. Hockey registration and tournament fees;
- b. Gymnastics (including Trampoline and Parkour) registration and membership fees;
- c. Baseball registration and tournament fees;
- d. Camps (day or overnight);
- e. Before and after school daycare costs;
- f. Medical and dental expenses net of insurance coverage including orthodontic and eyeglasses;
- g. Psychological counselling fees net of insurance coverage; and
- h. Other sports fees as the child may choose from time to time.
13. Each of the expenses referred to in paragraph 12 are 'special and extraordinary expenses' within the meaning of s. 7 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines .

[328] On September 21, 2016, the claimant  did not attend Provincial Court for the PIO hearing. A hearing was held in front of Judge Marchand.  The Ministry  sought PIOs on the basis that contact between the Child and mother will cause the Child to be in need of protection pursuant  to s. 13(1)(e) of the CFCSA (emotional harm). Counsel for the Ministry  appeared, as did counsel  for the respondent.  Following that hearing, the court made the following  Orders:

THIS COURT ORDERS that pursuant to Section 28(3)(a) of the Child, Family and Community Service Act, [the claimant], born [DOB omitted], is prohibited for a period of six (6) months, from contacting or interfering with or trying to contact or interfere with [the Child], or from entering any premises or vehicle or boarding any vessel that [the Child] attends, to expire on March 20,2017;

THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS that pursuant to Section 28(3)(b) of the Child, Family and Community Service Act, [the claimant], [DOB omitted], is prohibited for a period of six (6) months from residing with [the Child], or from entering any premises or vehicle, or boarding any vessel, where [the Child] resides when he is present, including any premises, vehicle or vessel, where [the claimant] owns or has a right to occupy, to expire on March 20,2017;

THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS that pursuant to Section 28(5) of the Child, Family and Community Service Act, any police officer is authorized to arrest [the claimant], without a warrant, if the police officer has reasonable grounds to believe that [the claimant] has contravened or is contravening this Order;

THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS that the Director's application that [the claimant] enter into a recognizance, pursuant to Section 28(c)(i) is adjourned generally;

## DISOBEYING THIS ORDER IS A CRIMINAL OFFENCE UNDER SECTION 127 OF THE CRIMINAL CODE PUNISHABLE BY FINE OR IMPRISONMENT

TAKE NOTICE THAT any police officer, including any R.C.M.P. officer having jurisdiction in the province of British Columbia, having reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the person against whom this order is made has contravened a term of this Order may take action to enforce the order, whether or not there is proof that the order has been served on the person and, if necessary, may use reasonable force. Enforcement action may include arresting the person against whom this order is made without a warrant in accordance with section 495 of the Criminal Code.

[329] On October 20, 2016, the claimant did not attend the Trial Management Conference in this litigation. A number  of Orders were made regarding required filings in anticipation of the upcoming trial, including an Order that if the claimant intends to attend the trial of this matter, she shall  file a Trial Brief no later than November 7, 2016.

[330] Although  the claimant denied knowledge of various Orders and court dates following  June 8, 2016, I have found  that she was aware of those Orders and court dates. She did not comply  with any of the Orders made by Master McDiarmid at the Trial Management Conference.

[331] N.M. received a copy of the respondent's Trial Brief (dated-stamped September 26, 2016), which  was filed and served within the time limits. He brought  it to the claimant's home a few weeks prior to the commencement  of trial.  The claimant saw this document,  yet claimed to be unaware  of much of the proceedings leading up to trial. This only further  supports my conclusion  that the claimant is untruthful  when  she says she was unaware  of many  of these recent  court proceedings.

[332] The claimant has never  filed a complete Financial Statement in these proceedings. It took several requests from the court during the course of this trial to have the claimant provide her most recent employment  paystub.

[333] The trial of this matter was scheduled  to commence on November  21, 2016 for five days. On Friday, November  18, 2016, the claimant took her first step in this litigation in several months.  She filed a Short Leave Application that day to seek an adjournment  of the trial. Short leave was granted and her adjournment  application was scheduled to be heard on Monday,  November 21, 2016.

[334] On November 21, 2016, the claimant's application to adjourn  the trial was heard by Master McDiarmid. Her application was denied. The trial was then scheduled to commence the following day. Rather  than five days, the trial took three weeks to complete. Despite the claimant's nearly  complete non-compliance  with the Rules and various Court Orders, the court exercised considerable latitude and flexibility  to allow  the claimant to call some witnesses, present her case and explore all issues on cross-examination.

## ISSUE #1 - GUARDIANSHIP AND PARENTING OF THE CHILD

## Positions of the Parties

[335] Guardianship  and parenting of the Child was the central  issue in this litigation. Both parties provided thorough  written  and oral submissions in support of their positions. I will address many  of their specific arguments  in my analysis. Here, I will only  briefly outline  the Orders they seek and generally  why.

[336] The claimant seeks to co-parent the Child with the respondent  on an equal basis. She seeks equally  shared parenting responsibilities and equally  shared parenting time. She further  seeks 'immediate re-unification'  with her son, with no conditions imposed upon  her parenting time with him. Although  the claimant's submissions focussed in large part on the respondent's lack of credibility and the risk of family violence she believes he poses, the claimant's ultimate position was that they  share parenting responsibilities and time equally.

[337] The claimant does not seek any Protection Orders. She is opposed to any Protection Orders imposed against her, arguing that she has engaged in no polarizing or alienating behaviours that  have caused emotional harm to the Child. Given their communication  difficulties, the claimant asks the court to order the involvement  of a parenting coordinator. In  order to eliminate any contact between the parties, she asks that her father,  N.M.,  facilitate the Child's transitions between homes.

[338] The respondent's position is more complex. He seeks, at this time, to have the claimant's guardianship terminated.  He wishes to be the Child's sole guardian, tasked with all parenting responsibilities. As a contact person, he asks that the claimant's contact with the Child be in his sole discretion at this time. I say 'at this time' because the respondent's position contemplates  a future  review whereby,  if the claimant presents proper evidence, the court could consider the claimant's 'reinstatement  as a guardian' and changes to her contact  or parenting time. In order to have such a review, the respondent submits that the claimant must have taken steps to receive appropriate counselling  and/or treatment  to address the behaviours that have negatively  affected the Child. The respondent  asks that Dr. Aubé receive these Reasons for Judgment and be directed to provide any recommendations  at such a review. He asks that  the claimant bear the costs of such a review.

[339] In  making these submissions, the respondent  emphasizes that his long-term goal is not to prevent  the claimant from participating in parenting the Child. Rather, he is trying  to accomplish eventual  co-parenting  of some sort on a graduated basis,

with steps designed to best protect the Child's emotional safety and well-being.  The respondent  eventually  wants to co-parent with the claimant, but stresses that such a long-term  scenario rests entirely  upon whether  the claimant can, prior to a review, demonstrate compliance with Court Orders and admit and address her  alienating behaviours  that compromise the Child's best interests.  The respondent also seeks various protection and conduct orders.

## Law

[340] In  this section, I will first discuss the applicable legislative framework.  I will then  discuss the jurisprudence  on specific topics relevant  to my analysis. Specifically, I will discuss topics of family  violence and parental alienation.

## Legislative Framework

- [341] The relevant  legislation is set out in Parts 1, 4 and 9 of the FLA .
- [342] Part 1 is the interpretation  part of the FLA .
- [343] Section 1 defines certain terms used elsewhere  in the FLA . Of relevance, 'family  violence' is defined to include:
4. (a) physical abuse of a family member, including forced confinement or deprivation of the necessities of life, but not including the use of reasonable force to protect oneself or others from harm,
5. (b) sexual abuse of a family member,
6. (c) attempts to physically or sexually abuse a family member,
7. (d) psychological or emotional abuse of a family member, including
8. (i) intimidation, harassment, coercion or threats, including threats respecting other persons, pets or property,
9. (ii) unreasonable restrictions on, or prevention of, a family member's financial or personal autonomy,
10. (iii) stalking or following of the family member, and
11. (iv) intentional  damage to property, and
12. (e) in the case of a child, direct or indirect exposure to family violence;

[344] 'Parenting arrangements'  is defined to mean the 'arrangements  respecting the allocation of parental responsibilities or parenting time, or both'.

[345] 'Parental responsibilities' means 'one or more of the parental  responsibilities listed in section 41.'

- [346] 'Parenting time' means 'parenting time as described in section 42'.
- [347] Part 4 of the FLA sets out the regime for care of and time with a child. This part is divided into eight divisions. Divisions 1 through  4 are relevant  to these proceedings.

[348] Division 1 deals with the best interests of the child. Sections 37 and 38 of the FLA provide:

## Best interests of child

- 37 (1) In  making an agreement or order under this Part respecting guardianship, parenting arrangements or contact with a child, the parties and the court must consider the best interests of the child only.
- (2) To determine what is in the best interests of a child, all of the child's needs and circumstances must be considered, including the following:
- (a) the child's health and emotional well-being;
- (b) the child's views, unless it would be inappropriate to consider them;
- (c) the nature and strength of the relationships between the child and significant persons in the child's life;
- (d) the history of the child's care;
- (e) the child's need for stability, given the child's age and stage of development;
- (f) the ability  of each person who is a guardian or seeks guardianship of the child, or who has or seeks parental responsibilities, parenting time or contact with the child, to exercise his or her responsibilities;
- (g) the impact of any family violence on the child's safety, security or well-being, whether the family violence is directed toward the child or another family member;
- (h) whether the actions of a person responsible for family violence indicate that the person may be impaired in his or her ability  to care for the child and meet the child's needs;
- (i) the appropriateness of an arrangement that would require the child's guardians to cooperate on issues affecting the child, including whether requiring cooperation would increase any risks to the safety, security or well-being of the child or other family members;

- (j) any civil or criminal proceeding relevant to the child's safety, security or well-being.
- (3) An agreement or order is not in the best interests of a child unless it protects, to the greatest extent possible, the child's physical, psychological and emotional safety, security and well-being.
- (4) In making an order under this Part, a court may consider a person's conduct only if it substantially affects a factor set out in subsection (2), and only to the extent that it affects that factor.

## Assessing family  violence

38 For the purposes of section 37 (2) (g) and (h) [best interests of child] , a court must consider all of the following:

- (a) the nature and seriousness of the family violence;
- (b) how recently the family violence occurred;
- (c) the frequency of the family violence;
- (d) whether any psychological or emotional abuse constitutes, or is evidence of, a pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour directed at a family member;
- (e) whether the family violence was directed toward the child;
- (f) whether the child was exposed to family violence that was not directed toward the child;
- (g) the harm to the child's physical, psychological and emotional safety, security and well-being as a result of the family violence;
- (h) any steps the person responsible for the family violence has taken to prevent further family violence from occurring;
- (i) any other relevant matter.
- [349] Division 2 deals with parenting  arrangements.  This division starts with the default  guardianship provisions in s. 39, which include:

## Parents are generally guardians

- 39 (1) While a child's parents are living together and after the child's parents separate, each parent of the child is the child's guardian.
- (2) Despite subsection (1), an agreement or order made after separation or when the parents are about to separate may provide that a parent is not the child's guardian.

…

[350] Section 40 establishes the framework for making 'parenting arrangements',  a term that,  as outlined  above, includes  parental responsibilities and parenting time. Section 40 provides:

## Parenting arrangements

- 40 (1) Only a guardian may have parental responsibilities and parenting time with respect to a child.
- (2) Unless an agreement or order allocates parental responsibilities differently,  each child's guardian may exercise all parental responsibilities with respect to the child in consultation with the child's other guardians, unless consultation would be unreasonable or inappropriate in the circumstances.
- (3) Parental responsibilities may be allocated under an agreement or order such that they may be exercised by
- (a) one or more guardians only, or
- (b) each guardian acting separately or all guardians acting together.
- (4) In the making of parenting arrangements, no particular arrangement is presumed to be in the best interests of the child and without limiting that, the following must not be presumed:
- (a) that parental responsibilities should be allocated equally among guardians;
- (b) that parenting time should be shared equally among guardians;
- (c) that decisions among guardians should be made separately or together.
- [351] Section 41 sets out the list of 'parental  responsibilities' that a guardian must exercise in the best interests of the child. It provides:

## Parental responsibilities

41 For the purposes of this Part, parental responsibilities with respect to a child are as follows:

- (a) making day-to-day decisions affecting the child and having day-to-day care, control and supervision of the child;
- (b) making decisions respecting where the child will reside;
- (c) making decisions respecting with whom the child will live and associate;
- (d) making decisions respecting the child's education and participation in extracurricular activities, including the nature, extent and location;

- (e) making decisions respecting the child's cultural, linguistic, religious and spiritual upbringing and heritage, including, if the child is an aboriginal child, the child's aboriginal identity;
- (f) subject to section 17 of the Infants Act , giving,  refusing or withdrawing consent to medical, dental and other healthrelated treatments for the child;
- (g) applying for a passport, licence, permit, benefit, privilege or other thing for the child;
- (h) giving, refusing or withdrawing consent for the child, if consent is required;
- (i) receiving and responding to any notice that a parent or guardian is entitled or required by law to receive;
- (j) requesting and receiving from third parties health, education or other information respecting the child;
- (k) subject to any applicable provincial legislation,
- (i) starting, defending, compromising or settling any proceeding relating to the child, and
- (ii) identifying,  advancing and protecting the child's legal and financial interests;
- (l) exercising any other responsibilities reasonably necessary to nurture the child's development.

[352] Section 42 defines a child's time with a guardian as 'parenting  time' and discusses the guardian's responsibilities during that parenting time. It provides:

## Parenting time

- 42 (1) For the purposes of this Part, parenting time is the time that a child is with a guardian, as allocated under an agreement or order.
- (2) During parenting time, a guardian may exercise, subject to an agreement or order that provides otherwise, the parental responsibility of making day-today decisions affecting the child and having day-to-day care, control and supervision of the child.

[353] Section 43(1) re-enforces that a guardian must exercise parental responsibilities in the best interests of the child.

[354] Section 45 authorizes  the court to make Orders about parenting arrangements,  including the use of parenting coordinators or supervised parenting time. Parenting coordinators help high-conflict  families implement agreements or Orders respecting parenting arrangements,  contact with the child or other prescribed matters. Section 45 provides:

## Orders respecting parenting arrangements

- 45 (1) On application by a guardian, a court may make an order respecting one or more of the following:
- (a) the allocation of parental responsibilities;
- (b) parenting time;
- (c) the implementation of an order made under this Division;
- (d) the means for resolving disputes respecting an order made under this Division.
- (2) An order under subsection (1) must not be made if the child's guardians are the child's parents and are not separated.
- (3) The court may make an order to require that the transfer of a child from one party to another, or that parenting time with a child, be supervised by another person named in the order if the court is satisfied that supervision is in the best interests of the child.
- (4) Despite subsection (1), a person applying for guardianship may apply, at the same time, for an order under this section.
- [355] Division 3 deals with guardianship,  including  its termination.  Sections 51 and 52 provide in part:

## Orders respecting guardianship

- 51 (1) On application, a court may
- (a) appoint a person as a child's guardian, or
- (b) except in the case of a director who is a child's guardian under the Adoption Act or the Child, Family and Community Service Act , terminate a person's guardianship of a child.

...

## Who is entitled to notice

- 52 (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), if an application is made under this Division, the following persons must be served with notice of the application:
- (a) each parent or guardian of the child affected by the application;
- (b) each adult person with whom the child usually lives and who generally has care of the child;
- (c) any other person to whom the court considers it appropriate to serve with notice.

…

- (3) The court may grant an exemption from a requirement to give notice under subsection (1) if the court considers it appropriate.

[356] Division 4 of Part 4 of the FLA deals with 'contact' with a child. Under s. 1 of the FLA , 'contact'  refers to time spent with the child by a person who is not a guardian. A contact person does not have parental responsibilities.

[357] Section 59 allows a court to make orders for contact, including  the type of contact and any terms associated with it. It provides, in part:

## Orders respecting contact

- 59 (1) On application, a court may make an order respecting contact with a child, including describing the terms and form of contact.
- (2) A court may grant contact to any person who is not a guardian, including, without limiting the meaning of "person" in any other provision of this Act or a regulation made under it, to a parent or grandparent.
- (3) The court may make an order to require the parties to transfer the child under the supervision of, or require contact with the child to be supervised by, another person named in the order if the court is satisfied that supervision is in the best interests of the child.

…

[358] Part 9 of the FLA deals with protection from family  violence. A Protection Order in this Part is a safety-related  order for an 'at risk family member' in which breaches of the Order are criminal offences.

- [359] Sections 182 through  185 provide as follows:

## Definitions

182 In this Part and the regulations made under section 248 (1) (d) [general regulation-making powers] :

"at-risk family  member" means a person whose safety and security is or is likely  at risk from family violence carried out by a family member;

"firearm" has the same meaning as in the Criminal Code ;

"residence" means a place where an at-risk family member normally or temporarily resides, including a place that was vacated because of family violence;

"weapon" has the same meaning as in the Criminal Code .

## Orders respecting protection

183 (1) An order under this section

- (a) may be made on application by a family member claiming to be an at-risk family member, by a person on behalf of an atrisk family member, or on the court's own initiative, and
- (b) need not be made in conjunction with any other proceeding or claim for relief under this Act.
- (2) A court may make an order against a family member for the protection of another family member if the court determines that
- (a) family violence is likely to occur, and
- (b) the other family member is an at-risk family member.
- (3) An order under subsection (2) may include one or more of the following:
- (a) a provision restraining the family member from
- (i) directly or indirectly communicating with or contacting the at-risk family member or a specified person,
- (ii) attending at, nearing or entering a place regularly attended by the at-risk family member, including the residence, property, business, school or place of employment of the at-risk family member, even if the family member owns the place, or has a right to possess the place,
- (iii) following the at-risk family member,
- (iv) possessing a weapon, a firearm or a specified object, or
- (v) possessing a licence, registration certificate, authorization or other document relating to a weapon or firearm;
- (b) limits on the family member in communicating with or contacting the at-risk family member, including specifying the manner or means of communication or contact;

(c) directions to a police officer to

- (i) remove the family member from the residence immediately or within a specified period of time,
- (ii) accompany the family member, the at-risk family member or a specified person to the residence as soon as practicable, or within a specified period of time, to supervise the removal of personal belongings, or
- (iii) seize from the family member anything referred to in paragraph (a) (iv) or (v);
- (d) a provision requiring the family member to report to the court, or to a person named by the court, at the time and in the manner specified by the court;

- (e) any terms or conditions the court considers necessary to
- (i) protect the safety and security of the at-risk family member, or
- (ii) implement the order.
- (4) Unless the court provides otherwise, an order under this section expires one year after the date it is made.
- (5) If an order is made under this section at the same time as another order is made under this Act, including an order made under Division 5 [Orders Respecting Conduct] of Part 10, the orders must not be recorded in the same document.

## Whether to make protection order

- 184 (1) In determining whether to make an order under this Part, the court must consider at least the following risk factors:
- (a) any history of family violence by the family member against whom the order is to be made;
- (b) whether any family violence is repetitive or escalating;
- (c) whether any psychological or emotional abuse constitutes, or is evidence of, a pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour directed at the at-risk family member;
- (d) the current status of the relationship between the family member against whom the order is to be made and the at-risk family member, including any recent separation or intention to separate;
- (e) any circumstance of the family member against whom the order is to be made that may increase the risk of family violence by that family member, including substance abuse, employment or financial problems, mental health problems associated with a risk of violence, access to weapons, or a history of violence;
- (f) the at-risk family member's perception of risks to his or her own safety and security;
- (g) any circumstance that may increase the at-risk family member's vulnerability, including pregnancy, age, family circumstances, health or economic dependence.
- (2) If family members are seeking orders under this Part against each other, the court must consider whether the order should be made against one person only, taking into account
- (a) the history of, and potential for, family violence,
- (b) the extent of any injuries or harm suffered, and
- (c) the respective vulnerability of the applicants.

- (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the person who initiates a particular incident of family violence is not necessarily the person against whom an order should be made.
- (4) The court may make an order under this Part regardless of whether any of the following circumstances exist:
3. (a) an order for the protection of the at-risk family member has been made previously against the family member against whom an order is to be made, whether or not the family member complied with the order;
4. (b) the family member against whom the order is to be made is temporarily absent from the residence;
5. (c) the at-risk family member is temporarily residing in an emergency shelter or other safe place;
6. (d) criminal charges have been or may be laid against the family member against whom the order is to be made;
7. (e) the at-risk family member has a history of returning to the residence and of living with the family member against whom the order is to be made after family violence has occurred;
8. (f) an order under section 225 [orders restricting communications] has been made, respecting the at-risk family member, against the family member against whom the order is to be made.

## If child a family member

185 If a child is a family member, the court must consider, in addition to the factors set out in section 184 [whether to make protection order] ,

- (a) whether the child may be exposed to family violence if an order under this Part is not made, and
- (b) whether an order under this Part should also be made respecting the child if an order under this Part is made respecting the child's parent or guardian.

## The Case Law on Family Violence

[360] Family violence is not limited to physical violence in the FLA . Rather,  the term is broadly defined. Emotional and psychological  abuse are the primary considerations in the case at bar. While each case is factually  unique,  certain general principles emerge from the case authorities.

[361] In D.N.L. v. C.N.S. , 2014 BCSC 1417, Mr. Justice Pearlman held that demeaning remarks about the other parent to the child, threats  to use physical force to compel the child to accompany the parent and suggestions that the other parent

was responsible for the conflict in the family,  constitute  emotional abuse. In  this regard, the court held:

- [71] As a result of the respondent's derogatory remarks about her mother and maternal grandparents, his outbursts of anger, his refusal to permit the child to return to her mother's home when she becomes distraught in his care, and the child's perception that her father is more interested in scoring points in his conflict with the claimant than meeting her needs, E.M.H.L.-S. is very angry with her father and is apprehensive about any contact with him. She wants no further contact with the respondent until he demonstrates that he is capable of curbing his anger and putting her needs ahead of his own.
- [72] Under s. 1 of the FLA , family violence includes psychological or emotional abuse of a family member, including intimidation, harassment, coercion or threats. Section 37(2) requires the court, in determining what order is in the best interest of the child to consider the impact of any family violence on the child's safety, security or well-being. I find that the respondent's demeaning remarks about the claimant, his repeated assertions to the child that she has been "brain washed" or manipulated by her mother, his threats to use physical force to compel her to accompany him and his suggestions to the child that her mother is responsible for the conflict that divides this family constitute emotional abuse of E.M.H.L.-S. That abuse undermines the child's emotional safety, security and well-being.
- [73] Under s. 37(3) of the FLA , an order is not in the best interests of a child unless it protects to the greatest extent possible, the child's physical, psychological and emotional safety, security and well-being. I find that in all of the circumstances of this case, it is not in E.M.H.L.-S.'s best interest to make an order compelling her to have parenting time with her father. As Dr. Waterman has reported, forcing the child to have contact with her father now may adversely affect any prospects for a more positive relationship in the future. An order requiring continuing contact with the respondent against the child's wishes would be contrary to her emotional well-being and would not serve her best interests. Accordingly, this Court's order of May 8, 2013 defining the respondent's parenting time with E.M.H.L.-S. is terminated. The respondent will cease to have court-ordered parenting time with the child.
- [74] In reaching this decision I have considered the respondent's proposal that he continue to have the parenting time ordered on May 8, 2013, but with the child having the ability to terminate any visit by calling her mother. In my view an order on those terms would do little to reduce the child's anxiety or her resistance to contact with her father. One of the factors contributing to the child's refusal to have parenting time with C.N.S. is her experience of her father refusing to permit her to call her mother when she has become distraught while in the respondent's care. Regrettably, C.N.S. still does not appreciate the effect of his behaviour on his relationship with the child.
- [75] The respondent will only begin to build an enduring relationship with E.M.H.L.-S. when he demonstrates that he is capable of changing his ways and putting her interests ahead of his own. That is likely to take some time. That process will not be advanced by imposing upon the child a schedule for parenting time that she does not want and with which she refuses to comply.

[362] In K.R. v. J.D. ,  2017 BCSC 182, Mr. Justice Jenkins held that  the respondent's derogatory and demeaning comments regarding the claimant, on occasion in the child's presence, 'clearly  amount  to family violence' in that they disturbed the child and caused the child emotional harm: para. 17.

[363] In M.W.B. v. A.R.B., 2013 BCSC 885 , Mr. Justice N. Brown considered whether  a lack of cooperation in selling assets and other aspects of the claimant's litigation conduct  was emotional abuse and harassment  that constituted  family violence.  In concluding  that  it was, the court wrote:

[199] I find the [Respondent's] litigation conduct, related both to the selling of the commercial property and to parenting arrangements, considered in their totality, is a form of emotional abuse and harassment that constitute a form of family violence.

[200] The Respondent's conduct and needless litigation has forced the Claimant to incur litigation expenses, damaging his financial well-being and health. This hindered his capacity to preserve parenting time with the children. Litigation has used up much of his emotional and financial resources.

[201] The stress resulting from the Respondent's conduct and the needless litigation  it generated has precipitated in the Claimant a sometimes very painful medical condition that has needed surgical procedures. Contact with the Respondent and litigation aggravates the condition. I note that he was in much pain on his March 2012 and December 2012 access visits, but the children were not made aware of this; and as well in the December 2012 holiday visit, he persisted despite the pain, providing the children with an excellent holiday experience. However, he had to shorten it somewhat, which the Respondent criticized, due to his condition at that time.

[202] The Respondent's refusal to pursue recommended professional counselling for anger management, or take part in courses such as "Parenting after Separation", and the history thus far, give little reason to expect a change in the Respondent's future behaviour. While anger problems appear not to have directly impacted the children's relationship with the Respondent, it remains a concern.

[203] The Respondent complains indignantly about the stress of litigation, for which she blames the Claimant. But I have no evidence of ill-health or stress-related condition from which she suffers.

[204] The best interests of children suffer when abusive oppositional behaviour and litigation fomented by one parent's conduct harms the health and financial well-being of the other parent. This in turn harms the children's economic safety and security.

[205] Further, the Respondent's reckless and oppositional behaviour connected with the commercial property has damaged the children's safety,

and economic security. It effectively deprived them of receiving any benefit from sale of the property, endangered the Claimant's capacity to support the children and consumed money the Claimant could have used for a greater number of parent time visits. The Respondent knew her delaying and oppositional conduct harmed the Claimant's capacity to pay the cost of access visits.

[206] If a parent's abusive conduct harms the well-being of the other parent to the extent they may have to go on stress leave, this negatively impacts the child's economic security.

[207] The Respondent knew the children loved their father very much and felt hurt when the Claimant had to move to Vancouver. They did not fully understand the reasons he had to move away. The Respondent knew the father had to move to Vancouver to earn enough to pay support and pay debts. The children missed their father and needed as much personal contact with him as practicable after he moved. The Respondent's conduct made this increasingly difficult.

[208] The Respondent knew or ought to have known the impact her conduct was having on the Claimant's financial situation; the Claimant made it clear to her. From this, I infer the Respondent is prepared to let her anger at the Claimant influence her to act in a way that indirectly harms the best interests of the children. I find the Claimant will not conduct himself in that way; the litigation  history proves otherwise.

[209] In summary, I find that the Respondent has directed violence at the Claimant that has indirectly harmed the children's psychological and emotional well-being and economic security. Without a change of principal residence for B.B., I anticipate the Claimant could expect to face the same continuing pattern, usually subtle, sometimes overt, of oppositional behaviour and interference. Without intense counselling, I doubt the Respondent will be able to change her behaviour. She has no respect for professional opinion and apparently little regard for court orders.

[364] In L.A.R. v. E.J.R. , 2014 BCSC 966, Mr. Justice Schultes held that the father's disparaging comments to the mother in the presence of the children and the father's conduct in showing  the oldest child lengthy  and acrimonious text messages between the parties amounted  to emotional abuse constituting  family violence:  para. 149.

[365] The court must also be careful  not to label conduct as 'family  violence' where there is no evidence the child has suffered any  physical or emotional harm as a result  of the parents' conduct.  The provisions in the FLA relating to family violence are intended to address a serious social issue and to protect children and spouses

from actual  harm or danger: L.S. v. G.S. ,  2014 BCSC 187, aff'd 2014 BCCA 334 at para. 26.

## The Case Law on Parental Alienation

[366] The respondent  asks the court to find the claimant 'guilty'  of alienation. The claimant denies engaging in any alienating behaviours.  From the tenor of her submissions, I infer that  the claimant's position is that the breakdown of the Child's relationship with the respondent until  the Child was placed in his full  time care was due to estrangement  caused by the respondent's  behaviour,  not alienating behaviours  on her part.

[367] In N.R.G. v. G.R.G. ,  2015 BCSC 1062, Kent J. discussed the distinct concepts of alienation and estrangement  as follows:

[276] In high-conflict separations, both parents commonly attempt to undermine their children's relationship with the other parent. Occasionally children reject one of the parents, resisting or even refusing contact. It is in such contexts that the concepts of "estrangement" and "alienation" are often invoked.

[277] The difference between an estranged child and an alienated child lies in the cause; estrangement, sometimes referred to as "realistic estrangement", is the label applied when the child understandably refuses contact with a parent because of the latter's behaviour whether it be physical or emotional abuse, rigid or restrictive parenting, immature and self-centered behaviour, and/or dysfunctional conduct arising from the parent's own psychological or psychiatric issues. In such circumstances, the child's rejection of the parent may well be a reasonable and adaptive response to the estranged parent's behaviour.

[278] An alienated child, on the other hand, is the label frequently applied when there is little or no objectively reasonable cause for the child's rejection of the parent and particularly when it is the product of the other parent's hostility and antipathy towards his/her former spouse and the intentional undermining by the former of the child's relationship with the latter. While the undermining of the relationship can arise from direct or indirect behaviours, in its worst form the parental conduct is expressly designed to alienate the child from the other parent. Such conduct is pernicious and unpardonable.

[368] Referencing N.R.G., the Court of Appeal recently  discussed the concepts of alienation and estrangement  in Williamson v. Williamson ,  2016 BCCA 87. Writing for the Court, Madam Justice Stromberg-Stein described the term 'parental alienation' and its general causes:

## Finding of Alienation

- [39] Some case authorities disclose that the issue of parental alienation is a controversial area in family law. This controversy is not before us and we are not resolving it. Parental alienation is a term that has been used in the context of divorce and separation cases to describe a breakdown in the relationship between a child and one of the separated parents. Some courts have said that alienation can occur as an unfortunate side-effect of the breakdown of a relationship, but can also occur because of deliberate actions, both direct and indirect, on the part of a parent: L.G. v. R.G. , 2012 BCSC 1365 at paras. 1-2. Courts have said parents may engage in alienating behaviour without successfully alienating the child from the other parent: L.G. at para. 206.

[40] In D.S.W. v. D.A.W. , 2012 BCSC 1522, Mr. Justice Barrow thoroughly discussed some of the concepts relating to parental alienation. At para. 64, Barrow J. stated that at the core of parental alienation is:

... the notion that the child's decision to refuse to have a relationship with the targeted parent is without justification or without convincing reason. If there is a reason given by the child for taking the extreme step of refusing to have a relationship with a parent, it will often be out of all proportion to the decision taken. The reasons for such decisions need to be assessed with the particular personality and experience of the child involved. What may seem a thin or unconvincing rationale for one child may have a much more convincing force in the context of the personality and experience of another child.

- [41] Barrow J. also observed that parental alienation must be distinguished from estrangement: D.S.W. at para. 28. Courts have said that the difference between estrangement and alienation lies in the cause; estrangement occurs when the child understandably refuses contact with a parent because of that parent's behaviour, and there is a logical and rational reason for the child's rejection of the parent. In the case of alienation, it is said there is little or no objectively reasonable cause for the child's rejection of the parent: N.R.G. v. G.R.G ., 2015 BCSC 1062 at paras. 277-278.

[369] The court in Williamson emphasized that an allegation of alienation is a serious one. Proof of such a serious allegation requires proper expert evidence to support the finding and to support any proposed remedial responses: paras. 47-48.

[370] If  a court finds a parent 'guilty'  of alienation,  there is no pre-determined remedy. Determining the appropriate remedy is an 'extremely  important  process since it can have an impact on both the short and long term well-being  of the children  involved': Williamson at para. 42.

## Analysis

[371] My assessment of the Child's best interests requires a close consideration of the parties' conduct,  as I have detailed. In  doing so, however,  I am mindful  of the common sense observation made by Mr. Justice Goepel, as he then  was, in K.D.P. v. A.R.K. aka R.K. , 2011 BCSC 1085:

- [1] No parents are perfect. All have flaws of one kind or another. If families stay together, except in those rare circumstances in which a child is found to be in need of protection, the state and the courts allow imperfect parents to raise their children as best they can. The children, in most cases, are no worse for wear for the experience.
- [2] If families separate, however, and issues of custody and access arise, in the guise of determining the best interests of the child, a parent's flaws of character and conduct are put under a microscope. In such circumstances, care must be taken not to lose sight of the strengths that a party brings to the challenge of raising a child.

[372] In  high-conflict  cases, such  as the case at bar, many courts have  recognized that the adversarial system often serves to increase the acrimony between the parties. Justice Kent put it well in N.R.G., when he wrote:

- [293] …People who once loved each other exchange vile insults and attach nasty labels to perceived deficiencies in character. Friends, family, police, teachers and ministry officials are summoned to denigrate one parent and advocate on behalf of the other. The interests of the children, best served by the positive involvement of both parents, are sacrificed on the altar of selfcentered animosity.
- [373] These things have,  unfortunately,  occurred in this case.
- [374] This trial was conducted over the span of 14 days. During that time, I was able to observe the parties closely and listen to their evidence.

[375] There is no question that  each parent loves the Child. There is no question that each parent has certain strengths  to bring to parenting the Child. Those strengths  were well-highlighted  by the witnessed called and the collateral  persons interviewed by Dr. Aubé. Unfortunately,  there is also no question that both parents' conduct  has negatively  affected the Child's health  and emotional well-being.  The

significant difference lies in that the respondent's  harmful  conduct improved and was eliminated very  quickly,  but the claimant's only  worsened and persists.

[376] I  will  now consider the s. 37 factors, mindful  that I am to consider the whole  of the evidence to ensure that  whatever  Orders I make protect, to the greatest extent possible, the Child's physical,  psychological and emotional safety,  security and wellbeing.

[377] Prior to their separation, both parties parented the Child. The Child had formed safe attachments  to them both.  Both parents were involved  in the Child's care, were nurturing  and were capable of attending  to the Child's needs. There  is no evidence that either parent compromised the Child's health  and emotional well-being during the years they  lived together in harmony.  Each parent brought  certain strengths  to their parenting. Dr. Aubé highlighted  those strengths  fairly and thoroughly  in the Report. Those identified strengths  are well-founded  in the evidence.

[378] When the relationship between the parties began to dissolve, things changed. It  was in these early months  that the respondent,  motivated by insecurity  and experiencing anxiety  over the loss of the relationship,  engaged in behaviour that can be characterized  as family violence.

[379] In  the spring and summer of 2014, before their separation, the respondent acknowledges that he behaved immaturely  in utilizing  a computer program to track the claimant's whereabouts  and, on one occasion (while the Child was present), in removing an item from the claimant's vehicle.  In  addition to reflecting the respondent's immaturity  at the time, I find that this conduct is properly characterized as family  violence. It  is 'following  a family member' over an extended period and, as an intrusion  on the claimant's privacy, constitutes  psychological  or emotional abuse.

[380] Fortunately,  there is no evidence the Child was exposed to this behaviour other than  his presence in his father's vehicle on one occasion where the respondent  removed an item from the claimant's vehicle.  There is no evidence the

respondent's behaviours  in this regard harmed the physical,  psychological, emotional safety, security  or well-being of the Child. As well,  once the parties formally  agreed to separate in early November  of 2014, the respondent did not engage in these behaviours  any further.

[381] During the first few months  of their separation, while they  were all living under the same roof, both parties remained involved  in parenting the Child as they  had before, but tensions in the home were high and arguments  between the parties were frequent.  The Child was exposed to this tension and some of these arguments,  as was B.A.M. This exposure would  naturally  undermine  the Child's emotional wellbeing and sense of stability. However,  during these months,  there is nothing  in the evidence to suggest that the Child aligned more with one parent over the other, nor is there anything  to suggest that the Child's attachment  to either parent lessened during this time.

[382] The respondent  did not always shield the Child or B.A.M. from his anxiety surrounding  the dissolution of the parties' relationship.  I refer here particularly  to the events  of November  10, 2014. Due to the respondent's conduct  that evening,  the Child was left with the impression that his father  may have engaged in self-harm. While the respondent's conduct  was aimed at trying to generate an emotional response from the claimant  and not an actual attempt at self-harm,  the respondent's behaviour  did harm the Child's emotional well-being. As such, it constitutes  an incident of family  violence.

[383] Fortunately,  this incident of family violence was not directed explicitly  at the Child and does not form part of a pattern of coercive and controlling  behaviour directed either at the claimant or the Child. I accept the respondent's  evidence that through  his counselling,  he has developed insight into his behaviour  and has taken significant steps to prevent  this from occurring again. He has perpetrated no incidents of family  violence since that time.

[384] The respondent  deserves a great deal of credit for taking substantial  steps since the time of separation to develop insight into his own behaviour,  its causes,

how it negatively  impacted his relationship with the claimant and caused emotional harm to the Child. The respondent embraced the recommendations of his counsellor.  He embraced the recommendations  of Dr. Aubé. He sought out and received support from the Ministry,  ICS family support workers and Mr. Reedman. He embraced the recommendations made by all of these professionals. He was able to look at his own behaviours  through  a critical lens and make demonstrable changes. Through  his own hard work since the time of separation, the respondent has enhanced his parenting skills in order to better address the Child's needs. He has learned to recognize his communication  shortcomings with the claimant and has improved those skills as well.  I find the respondent's insight is genuine and easily conclude  that the Child is at no risk of family  violence while in his care.

[385] What then was the cause of the Child's rejection of the respondent leading up to and at the time of the parenting time exchanges?  On the facts that I have found, the conclusion  is obvious and compelling.

[386] There is no evidence to support a conclusion  that the respondent  engaged in any behaviour  that might estrange the Child. The circumstances of the Child's sudden lack of contact with his father at the end of March 2015 due to his hospitalization  may have caused a temporary  estrangement,  but by all accounts, once the Child was actually  with his father  during his parenting  time, he was happy and well cared for. The Child could not explain why  he did not feel safe with his father.  His behaviour  while with his father,  all positive, was not consistent  with the fear and anxiety  he expressed. All of the evidence supports a finding that  the respondent  and the Child had, and continue  to have, a close attachment  and there is little  or no objectively  reasonable cause for the Child's ever-increasing  rejection of the respondent before he was placed with the respondent  full  time.

[387] The evidence clearly establishes that from April 2015 the claimant consistently  engaged in behaviours  that slowly  alienated the Child from the respondent.  Fortunately,  Ministry  intervention  prevented complete alienation. I am

satisfied that lay and expert evidence prove that the claimant attempted alienation. The behaviours  I identify are these:

1.  The claimant actively  frustrated  the respondent's access to information about the Child;
2.  The claimant unilaterally  exercised parenting responsibilities, including making decisions about enrolling  the Child in counselling  services, without  the respondent's knowledge or consent.  When the respondent later learned of these activities, the claimant refused to share information with him. The claimant continued  to do so, even in the face of Orders compelling her to make decisions jointly  with the respondent;
3.  The claimant consistently  controlled  and manipulated  the respondent's parenting time with the Child. As she had done with R.P. and B.A.M. many years before, at first, she only agreed to minimal parenting time. Her approach to the respondent's parenting time was that it must be conducted all on her terms, with the 'take it or leave it' approach.  Unlike R.P., the respondent  did not always 'take it'. The respondent was compelled to obtain Orders for parenting  time. The claimant failed to follow  those Orders on many occasions. She often unilaterally  cancelled or altered the respondent's court ordered parenting time in some way, offering contrived  excuses. In  situations where she could have easily agreed to additional parenting time contemplated  by Court Orders, she did not.  In closing submissions, the claimant argued that she 'was reluctant  to agree to parenting time without  an agreement through  the court as she wasn't certain [the  Child] would return.'  I do not accept this submission for two reasons. First, the evidence does not support a finding that the claimant's behaviour  was motivated by a fear the respondent  would not return  the Child. Second, even with Court Orders in place, she failed to comply with them on many  occasions;
4.  The claimant undermined  the respondent's parenting time by manipulating the Child. The starkest example of this manipulation  is seen in her

conscription of the Child to carry out her 'plan'  of July 26, 2016. More subtle examples include her promises of toys or fun  activities if the Child could convince  his father to cut short their time together;

5.  The claimant put the Child in the middle of the conflict on many occasions by encouraging  him to telephone his father  to change or cancel the parenting time. The claimant sees this as giving the Child a 'voice',  but the evidence proves this conduct had a negative emotional effect on the Child. As he shared with Dr. Aubé, the Child feels sadness, anger and confusion.  He feels caught  in the middle of his parents' battle. He candidly told Dr. Aubé that he thought  their 'war' was 'because of him'. To have the Child put in a position where his mother encouraged him to 'convince'  his father  to cancel parenting time, is very  emotionally  harmful  to him;
6.  The claimant gave the Child mixed messages about his time with his father. On the one hand, she encouraged the Child to go with the respondent at the exchange times and enlisted the help of Ms. Ballance on occasion in doing so. On the other hand,  she allowed the Child to be privy  to her concerns about the respondent  and enlisted his participation in plans that would see him 'get out' of time with his father. It  is hardly  surprising that the Child was terribly confused  and emotionally  harmed by this;
7.  The claimant's involvement  of B.A.M. in this dispute is also a factor. Immediately  after the parties ceased living together  under the same roof, B.A.M. refused any  further  contact with the respondent.  He did this in spite of the fact that he and the respondent  had a close and loving  relationship prior to separation. The claimant  supported and reinforced B.A.M.'s decision. The fact that B.A.M. quickly aligned with his mother and refused any  further contact with the respondent demonstrates  his exposure to the claimant's version of events.  This act of proving his loyalty  to his mother affected not only  B.A.M.'s attachment  to the respondent,  but naturally  affected the Child's

attachment  to the respondent  as well.  This act also supports Dr. Aubé's observation that:

Although I have no doubt that [the claimant] dearly loves her children, it seems that often her attachment comes with conditions. She requires that her loved ones distinctly follow her agenda. Regrettably, I suspect that her children have perceived their mother's love as safe when they agree with their mother.

The claimant also discussed matters at the heart of this litigation with B.A.M. She allowed him to read the Report and discussed its contents with him. The claimant is unapologetic about this conduct.  This conduct  is clearly continuing.  When the Ministry  stepped in and pursued the PIO in the summer and fall of 2016, B.A.M. decided at that time to cut off all contact with his brother. He did this as another  show of solidarity with his mother.  He did this in spite of the fact that he described his relationship with his brother as close, 'more like a full brother than  a half brother',  only  a few months  before. That  the claimant supports B.A.M.'s decision to no longer see his brother is troubling.  The Child must be terribly confused  and hurt  by his brother's absence in his life.

[388] In  light of the foregoing, it is no surprise that the Child gradually  became more confused and anxious around parenting  time with the respondent.  The claimant's overall  conduct had the effect of gradually  changing the Child's attitudes and behaviours  in respect of his father.  The evidence fully  supports Dr. Aubé's opinion that the claimant has given the Child explicit and implicit messages that have undermined the Child's relationship with his father.  This polarization created a high level of stress and anxiety  for the Child.  The Child's conduct  around transition  times, including  leaving school grounds to avoid his father's pick up times and his extreme emotional behaviours,  speak volumes  as to the forces at play.

[389] I  find that the claimant's conduct as outlined  above constitutes  emotional or psychological  abuse of the respondent  and the Child. It is a pattern of coercive and

controlling  behaviour  directed at the respondent,  the Child and B.A.M. which  has harmed the Child's psychological and emotional safety,  security  and well-being.

[390] This pattern of coercive and controlling  behaviour  culminated  in the events of July  26, 2016. The claimant did not want to be a 'part-time mom'. She did not want the respondent to equally  co-parent with her. The June 8, 2016 Orders requiring equally  shared parenting time and responsibilities, with the respondent  having the final decision-making authority,  did not sit well with the claimant. As a result,  she engaged her eight-year-old  child in a 'plan'.  Her plan was to contrive a situation in which she would video-record the Child's feigned behaviour  at a transition  time. The Child was to force himself to cry and say he did not want to go with his father.  The recording would then  be shared with authorities and used to further  the claimant's agenda of preventing  the court-ordered shared parenting  arrangement.

[391] The emotional and psychological  impact from the events  of July  26, 2016 upon the Child was profound.  Unable to perform as his mother directed, he was taken to his father's home and interviewed by Ministry officials. The Child has not seen the claimant since that time. This must have been incredibly difficult for the Child, as he had a very  close bond with his mother.  It must have been incredibly difficult for the Child to disclose his mother's plan. This was the final act in the claimant's attempt to alienate the Child from the respondent.  It was the final act of family violence that  only ended when  the Ministry intervened.

[392] I  find that the claimant's litigation conduct is also a form of emotional abuse and harassment that constitutes  family  violence. As I have extensively  detailed, the claimant did not cooperate with most aspects of this litigation. She did not cooperate with any aspect of the sale of the family residence. Multiple  court applications were required. The claimant did not abide by many  Orders, did not respond to correspondence,  took matters into her own hands by breaking into the family residence, did not attend court, never  did provide full  financial  disclosure, and was generally  obstructionist  throughout  the litigation. Her attitude about Court Orders was well demonstrated on the day she accused the respondent of 'hiding behind an

order like a coward'. The claimant's conduct  and needless litigation has forced the respondent  to incur litigation expenses, damaging his financial well-being and creating undue  stress. The litigation has consumed  much of his emotional resources, impacting his parenting time with the Child. His damaged emotional state as a result of these things was very evident  throughout  the course of this trial.

[393] Since the Child has been removed from the polarizing behaviours  of his mother,  the Child's physical,  psychological and emotional health  has improved. The Child needs stability. Stability was imposed due to the Ministry's actions. The respondent  has maintained this stability. Although  the claimant breached the PIO  on one occasion, it does not appear this breach had any long-term  negative effect on the Child.

[394] Removed from the effects of his mother's behaviours,  the Child has, by all accounts,  become much  healthier  and happier over the last months.  Mr. Reedman has engaged the Child in counselling  and has become a good resource for the respondent  in addressing the Child's needs. I do accept, however,  that the Child very  much misses his mother.  I also accept that  the claimant also very  much misses her son.

[395] Unfortunately,  the claimant has not taken steps similar to those taken by the respondent  to improve her parenting  skills in order to promote the Child's needs. I commend her for engaging the assistance of a psychologist,  Dr. Ginter,  and another doctor to help with her symptoms of stress and anxiety,  but this is clearly  not the only  type of professional assistance the claimant needs. The claimant  does not see that her behaviours have  harmed the Child. Instead  of embracing the recommendations of Dr. Aubé and accepting the advice and assistance of various Ministry  officials, the claimant has chosen to lodge complaints against these neutral professionals. Here, I must emphasize that I am in the position of assessing all of the extensive  evidence that has been introduced in this trial and  unequivocally  find there is no evidence that any of these professionals are biased or have engaged in some sort of conspiracy against the claimant.  Quite simply,  the claimant believes her

approach to parenting the Child is the correct one and resists any other point of view. She has chosen to not comply with those trying  to help her and the Child, just as she has chosen to disobey Court Orders and not attend court.  All of these things negatively  impact her ability to make the changes required to exercise her parental responsibilities in the Child's best interests,  to care for the Child and to meet the Child's needs.

[396] The respondent  clearly can exercise his parenting responsibilities, care for the Child, and meet the Child's needs. The claimant possesses these innate abilities as well,  but unless she takes steps to recognize and address her behaviours that have harmed the Child, I do not think that she can meet the Child's needs at this time. One of the Child's critical needs is to have  stability. Another is to have a healthy  and strong attachment  with his father. The claimant  has no ability at present to meet those needs.

[397] Given the Child's age and the polarization  the claimant  has exposed him to, I do not consider it appropriate to consider the Child's views.

[398] The Provincial Court proceedings are relevant.  The claimant is currently prohibited from any contact  with the Child.

[399] Dr. Aube's opinion is fully  supported by the evidence adduced in this trial. All of the evidence firmly  establishes that the claimant engaged in behaviours  that alienated the Child from the respondent.  I find the claimant has engaged in behaviours  that have directly and indirectly  harmed the child's psychological  and emotional well-being and economic security.

[400] The Orders I make in respect of parenting must protect, to the  greatest extent possible, the Child's physical,  psychological and emotional safety and wellbeing.

[401] The claimant currently  lacks the insight to exercise her parental responsibilities in the Child's best interest.  She is unable to recognize that the behaviours  I have identified constitute  family  violence in the form of a pattern of psychological  or emotional abuse. The abuse has been directed pointedly  at the

Child, emotionally  and psychologically  harming him. The claimant has also directed the abuse towards the respondent  and B.A.M., indirectly exposing the Child to family violence and again, causing emotional and psychological  harm to him.

[402] Until the claimant undergoes professional counselling  with an expert in receipt of these Reasons for Judgment  and the Report, specifically to address those underlying  attitudes and behaviours  and takes steps to eliminate them,  she will continue  to emotionally  and psychologically  harm the Child. A cooperative coparenting arrangement  is inappropriate at this time for all of these reasons.

[403] Both parents are guardians of the Child. I decline to terminate the claimant's guardianship as the respondent  sought in closing submissions. He did not plead this drastic relief, nor did he identify it in his Trial Brief as relief that he would seek. The claimant did not have notice such relief would  be sought and to dispense with proper notice in these circumstances would  be unfair.

[404] However,  although  she will remain a guardian of the Child, I find the Child's best interests are served at this time by terminating  the claimant's parental responsibilities and parenting time until  further  Order of the Court. The respondent will have all parental  responsibilities, including  those identified in s. 41 of the FLA . The Child will live with the respondent.  The respondent will have all parenting time. until  further  Order of the Court. The Child is thriving  while in his father's sole care. He is free from the claimant's campaign of polarization  and the emotional and psychological  harm it caused. However,  this court will review the claimant's future parental responsibilities and parenting time. This review is to be held within  six to nine months  of the release of these reasons. I will be seized of this review.

[405] This review is intended to primarily address two things. First, to encourage the claimant to reflect on Dr. Aubé's opinions, which are well supported in the evidence, and on my findings about the harm her conduct  has caused the Child. The respondent  has addressed and rectified his negative behaviours a long time ago and made significant and long-lasting  changes such that he is well able now to meet the needs of the Child and serve his best interests. I would encourage  the claimant to

take steps with the help of professionals to understand  and modify her behaviours  in positive ways as well, to enable her to focus on the Child's needs and to recognize that his best interests are served by healthy,  stable attachments  to both parents. The claimant has much  to offer the Child and has the potential to change her harmful behaviours.  I sincerely  hope that the prospect of a review will encourage her to do so.

[406] Second, a review is necessary  because of the unusual  nature of this case. The claimant attempted to alienate the Child from the respondent.  With the Ministry's involvement  in late July  2016, complete alienation was not successful.  Now, however,  the Child has not had contact with the claimant for many  months.  The potential reunification  is, therefore,  unusually,  to be with the parent who engaged in the alienating behaviours.

[407] If  mother  and son are to reunite,  it must be in the Child's best interests. If  the claimant takes the necessary  steps I have  identified and a reunification is found  to be in the Child's best interests, such  a reunification  can only  occur with the utmost care and attention  to protect, to the greatest extent  possible, the Child's emotional health  and well-being.  Admissible expert opinion evidence must inform the court's response if the court were to grant the claimant parenting responsibilities and/or parenting time in the future.

[408] To that end, I order that an updated s. 211 report be prepared by Dr. Aubé, or some similarly qualified expert if Dr. Aubé is unavailable.  The expert should receive these Reasons for Judgment.  The parties will equally  share the cost of this updated report.

[409] I  further  order that  a pre-review case planning  conference  be held at least 30 days prior to the scheduled  review date. This conference  is to inform the court of the evidence each party intends to call at the review so that the court may manage how it receives evidence. I must  be clear that this review will not be a re-hearing  of the issues determined at trial. Rather,  the review is to determine what, if any, parental responsibilities and/or parenting time the claimant ought to have in the future.

- [410] I  hope that in addition to the updated s. 211 report, the claimant will seek to introduce admissible evidence from experts regarding the steps she has taken to address her harmful  behaviours  as identified in these reasons, that the respondent will seek to introduce admissible evidence from experts that have been working with the Child and that both parties will seek to introduce admissible evidence about how to reunify  mother  and son, if the court determines this to be in the Child's best interest at the review.  Evidence about professional reunification  programs may be particularly  helpful.

[411] The court needs to maintain a supervisory  role. To leave the claimant's future parenting time, if any, in the hands of the respondent as he suggests, would be to abdicate that role. This trial has addressed the claimant's attempt to alienate the Child from his father.  He is now estranged from his mother due to the POIs. If  the claimant does receive counselling  or other similar treatment  to address her underlying  behaviours  and her involvement  in the Child's life is found to be in his best interests, determining the appropriate approach to re-introduce  the Child to his mother in order to best protect his well-being is an extremely  important  process. Such a process, if it is to occur, must be done with great care and with the benefit of expert evidence.

- [412] I  turn  now to the respondent's application for a Protection Order under s. 183 of the FLA . I  have concluded the claimant has perpetuated family violence.  I am satisfied the respondent has established that both he and the Child are at-risk family members under s. 182. I am also satisfied the claimant's behaviours,  directed at both the Child and the respondent,  were repetitive and are likely to continue  to occur unless  the claimant makes fundamental  changes. The claimant's behaviours constitute  part of a pattern of coercive and controlling  behaviour  directed at both the Child and the respondent.
- [413] The claimant does not acknowledge that she engaged in these behaviours with the Child and the respondent.  She does not see that  her behaviours  harm her children.  For these reasons, she is highly  likely to continue  this harmful  behaviour,

should  there be contact. Accordingly,  I order that the claimant is restrained from directly or indirectly communicating  with the Child until  further  Order of the court. The claimant is further  restrained from attending at, nearing or entering a place regularly  attended by the Child, or the respondent,  including  their residence, property,  school or place of employment,  as the case may be. The claimant is further restrained from directly or indirectly  communicating  with the respondent,  except email communication  for the sole purpose of communicating  about matters relating to the Child and about any address or contact information  changes,  until further Order of the Court.

- [414] The future  review will also address these Protection Orders. If the claimant takes the steps that I have identified and presents admissible evidence that  she no longer poses a risk to the Child and the respondent,  these Protection Orders may be cancelled or varied.
- [415] I  turn  now to Conduct Orders. I find that various Conduct Orders are necessary to protect the Child's best interests.  First, the parties must communicate only  over email and only  about matters involving  the Child and about any  change of address and contact information.  Any such communications  between the parties must be concise and informative  only.
- [416] The respondent  must communicate to the claimant, over email, any significant decisions he makes regarding the Child. This will include the involvement of any new third parties with the Child, such as new counsellors,  doctors or teachers.
- [417] Each party must promptly  inform the other of any  change to his or her address and/or contact information.
- [418] The claimant must complete the Parenting After Separation online  course and file proof of completion by June 30, 2017.
- [419] The parties must not directly  or indirectly  discuss this litigation, including these Reasons for Judgment  and any  professional reports that have been or will be prepared, with the Child or with B.A.M. The parties must keep any  copy of these

Reasons for Judgment in a safe and secure place that neither the Child nor B.A.M. can access. They  will not show,  discuss or otherwise disclose the contents  of these Reasons for Judgment  to the Child or B.A.M. by any  means. They  will ensure  they do not discuss this litigation, including these Reasons for Judgment  and any professional reports that have been or will be prepared, in the presence of or near the Child or B.A.M.

[420] Each party must not make any  negative, insulting,  derogatory or disparaging comments about the other party within  the hearing of, in the presence of, or directly to the Child or B.A.M.

[421] Neither party may permit third parties (including  family members and relatives) to make any negative, insulting,  derogatory or disparaging remarks about the other party within the hearing of, in the presence of, or directly or indirectly to the Child or B.A.M.

[422] I  have included B.A.M. in the foregoing Orders as I hope that the brothers may reunite at some point in the future.  B.A.M. needs to avoid exposure to this litigation for his own well-being,  and keeping him free from exposure  will also indirectly  benefit the Child and hopefully  promote their reunification.

[423] It  may be that the parties will one day have an equally  shared parenting regime. Dr. Aubé originally  recommended this, prior to the events of last spring and summer. The respondent originally  sought this, and the claimant now seeks it. However, the claimant has some considerable work to do before the court could consider this to be in the Child's best interests.  Again, I wish to emphasize the court's hope that the prospect of a review might encourage the claimant to take the steps necessary.

## ISSUE #2 - CHILD SUPPORT

[424] The parties spent very  little time on this issue at trial.

[425] The claimant submits that the respondent ought  to pay her retroactive child support 'per the Federal Child Support Guidelines from April 2015 through  August 30, 2015, plus extra-ordinary  expenses'.  As the claimant adduced little to no evidence about these 'extra-ordinary  expenses' for which she seeks retroactive contribution,  I will consider only  her claim for retroactive table amount  of child support. The respondent  acknowledges that he paid the claimant no table amount  of child support for those months.

[426] For his part, the respondent seeks ongoing child support from the claimant in both the monthly  table amount  and for her proportionate share of the special and extraordinary  expenses set out in the Notice to Admit. The respondent  seeks retroactive awards from the time the Child first was in his sole care (the end of July 2016). The claimant acknowledges that she has paid no child support (either basic table amount  or special and extraordinary  expenses).

[427] The claimant is a self-represented  litigant. In Bennett v. Bennett , 2015 BCSC 699, Kent J. helpfully  provided a 'simple and non-exhaustive  summary  of the legal principles applicable to the awarding of child support' (at para. 39). He did so largely for the benefit of the self-represented  litigant in that case. I think  his summary  would be helpful  here as well. Justice Kent wrote:

## Obligation to Pay Child Support

- [40] Three fundamental principles apply to all child support applications:
1. parents have a joint and ongoing legal obligation to support their children;
2. it is the children, not the custodial parent, who have the right to support; and
3. support payments are based on earning capacity and not just on what a parent actually earns; as a result, a parent has a legal obligation to earn as much as he or she is reasonably capable of earning so the children can receive an appropriate level of support.
- [41] The court has jurisdiction under both the federal Divorce Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.), and the provincial Family Law Act , S.B.C. 2011, c. 25, to award support. Subject to certain exceptions, both Acts require that the amount of child support in any given case be governed by the Guidelines . These Guidelines are regulations which have been made under the Divorce Act . They include tables setting the amount of child support based on the incomes of the parents. They also provide for payment of "special or

extraordinary expenses", undue hardship, variation of support orders, how a parent's income is determined, imputation of income in certain circumstances, and exchange of financial information.

- [42] The terms of any separation agreement relating to child support will not necessarily be determinative of the issue. While the court may give some deference to agreements between parents, the latter cannot bargain away a child's right to support. In each instance, the court will determine the appropriate amount of weight to be given to the agreement between the parents.
- [43] The court can issue orders requiring the payment of child support prospectively or retroactively. It also has the power to vary, rescind or suspend orders that have already been made, although the circumstances warranting any variation will be governed by the Guidelines .
- [44] When exercising its discretion to make a retroactive child support order, the court will consider various factors including:
* the circumstances surrounding any delay in seeking a court order for support;
* whether the parent has engaged in blameworthy conduct;
* the past and present circumstances of the children, including their needs and standard of living; and
* whether any hardship would be caused by a retroactive award.

[45] Generally speaking, the child support obligation fluctuates with the level of income available to the parents. The latter have an obligation to support their children in a way that is commensurate with their income. A payor parent who does not increase child support payments to correspond with increased income does not fulfill his or her obligation to the children.

[46] Parents are obliged to fully and honestly disclose income information and documentation. At a minimum, this includes tax returns, notices of assessment/reassessment, statements of earnings, financial statements for self-employment, partnership or incorporated enterprises, and the like. Failure to provide disclosure can result in adverse inferences against, and the imputation of income to, the non-disclosing parent as the court considers appropriate.

[428] Integral  to determining the appropriate award of child support is the court's determination of the parties' incomes. Here, Kent J. explained:

## Determining Income

[47] The Guidelines set out specific procedures to determine the annual income of a parent. The starting point is the parent's "total income" disclosed in his or her income tax return. Schedule III  of the Guidelines then sets out various adjustments that can be made to that figure, whether as deductions or add-backs.

- [48] If there has been fluctuation in income or non-recurring receipts/expenses in the previous three years such that the number referred to above might not be the fairest determination of a parent's income, the court has a discretion to determine an annual amount that would be fair and reasonable in the circumstances.
- [49] Where a parent is a shareholder, director or officer of a corporation and the court is of the opinion that the parent's annual income set out on his or her tax return does not fairly reflect all the money available to that person for the payment of child support, the court has the discretion to include all or part of the corporation's pre-tax income in the analysis. Unreasonable payments or benefits paid to "non-arm's-length" persons dealing with the corporation can be added back to that pre-tax income.
- [50] Lastly, the court has the ability to impute income to a parent in a wide variety of circumstances. These include such things as intentional underemployment or unemployment, diversion of income to affect the level of child support, unreasonable deduction of expenses, failure to provide income information, and the like.
- [429] Justice Kent also discussed the distinction between basic or table amount  of child support and special and extraordinary  expenses pursuant  to s. 7 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines [ Guidelines ]:
- [56] The "basic" or "table" amount of support under the Guidelines is designed to provide contribution towards basic expenses for children such as food, housing, transportation, clothing, personal care, allowances, and vacation. However, the court also has the power to provide additional support amounts to cover certain identified "special or extraordinary expenses".
- [57] "Special" expenses include things like necessary childcare, healthcare costs, and post-secondary education.
- [58] Section 7 of the Guidelines also identifies two types of "extraordinary expenses". One category is for primary/secondary school education or for any other educational programs that meet the children's particular needs. The other is for "extracurricular activities".
- [59] The term "extraordinary expense" is defined by the Guidelines . It includes expenses which the parent cannot reasonably cover having regard to his or her income and the basic child support payment. It also includes other expenses appropriate to such things as the special needs and talents of the children, the nature of the program/activities, overall cost, and the like.
- [60] There are two overriding factors to be considered in determining whether an expense qualifies for additional support under s. 7 of the Guidelines , namely, that the expense be:
1. necessary in relation to the child's best interests; and
2. reasonable in relation to the means of the parents and to the family's spending pattern before separation.

- [61] With respect to all such special or extraordinary expenses, the general guiding principle is that they are to be shared by the parents in proportion to their respective incomes after deducting any contribution from the child.

## Determining the Parties' Incomes

[430] The respondent  has provided full  financial disclosure in this area. He has held the same employment  for several years. This employment  is his only  source of income. Determining his income for child support purposes is an easy task.

[431] The respondent's Line 150 amounts  in 2013 and 2014 were $80,400.83 and $81,336.00 respectively.  In  2015, he earned a slightly  higher annual  income $83,218.07. Deducting his union  or professional dues from this amount,  his 2015 income for child support purposes is determined to be $82,131.20.

[432] Although  the claimant has only one source of employment  income as well, her lack of disclosure and lack of specificity in this area has made determining her income for child support purposes more difficult.

- [433] The claimant did file a Financial Statement in April 2015, where she deposed to having an annual  income in the amount  of $69,677.97. Unfortunately,  she attached no documentation,  as required, to her Financial Statement.  Ultimately,  later in the litigation, the respondent was forced to apply to the court for an Order compelling the claimant to produce the required financial documentation.  On August 2, 2016, Hyslop  J. ordered the claimant to produce the following:
- a) her 2013, 2014 and 2015 income tax returns with attachments;
- b) her 2013, 2014 and 2015 Notices of Assessments;
- c) the documents listed on her Amended List of Documents dated January 29, 2016, as follows:
- d) Any financial record or account statement showing a balance owing for any debts held in the claimant's name as of the date of separation being November 7, 2014, including but not limited to:

- i. D1;

- ii. E1; and

- iii. E2

- i. MBNA MasterCard credit card; and
- ii. City Financial Bank loan.

[434] The claimant was ordered to produce the above documents  within  seven days of delivery  of the Order to her. Costs of the application were fixed at $1,250.00, inclusive  of taxes and disbursements,  and were ordered payable by the claimant to the respondent out of the sale proceeds of the family residence. This amount  was debited against the claimant's interest in the family residence.

- [435] The claimant did not produce the documents.

[436] The claimant's income for 2013 and 2014 can be reliably ascertained through documents tendered by the respondent.  The respondent  provided photocopies of the claimant's 2013 and 2014 Notices of Assessment. These documents  show that the claimant's income for 2013 was $59,720.00 and her income for 2014 was $72,085.00.

[437] What, then,  of 2015? Here, the evidence is a bit more challenging.  The respondent  was able to obtain evidence about the claimant's 2015 income from her supervisor.  As at August 21, 2015, the evidence from her supervisor  reliably establishes that the claimant's annual  salary was $70,321.36. This is a base amount of salary based upon the claimant's classification at the institution.  This is an amount that does not include additional income from overtime or through  working 'shift differentials'.

[438] The claimant testified that from January  2015 until  the summer  of 2016, she was seconded to a different position at the Justice Institute.  This position saw her income, for the duration  of the secondment,  increase 8%. With this evidence, one would expect her 2015 pay to be higher than the base amount  of $70,321.36. However, the claimant brought  her 2015 T4 to court.  This document  shows her 2015 income at $67,836.30. It is difficult to reconcile all of these amounts,  although  the amounts only  differ slightly.  In April 2015, the claimant deposed to an income of $69,677.97. However,  her 2015 T4 shows an annual  income of $67,836.30.

However, yet again, the letter from her supervisor shows her base earnings should have been $70,321.36.

[439] In  an effort to get the most recent information  available, the court directed the claimant to provide her most recent paystubs  during the course of the trial. After repeated requests, she eventually  provided a paystub.  This paystub proved to be somewhat unhelpful  as it only showed a very  modest portion of what  her income should  have been. The claimant explained that she had received short-term disability benefits for a few months  in 2016, due to stress. In  any event,  the claimant's 2016 paystubs do confirm that  her classification remains the same as that indicated by her supervisor  in August 2015.

[440] In  my view, the best evidence of the claimant's income comes from her supervisor's letter. I decline to impute additional income from potential overtime and shift differentials as sought  by the respondent.  He has not established that such  an imputation is appropriate in the circumstances.  I find the claimant's annual  income to be $70,321 for purposes of child support.

## Amount of Child Support Payable by the Claimant

[441] At an annual  income of $70,321.00, the claimant must pay the respondent  the table amount  of child support of $657.00 per month.  I order the claimant to pay this amount retroactive to August 1, 2016, when  the respondent became the Child's sole caregiver. The claimant must also pay her proportionate share of the special and extraordinary  expenses as set out in the Notice to Admit. These special and extraordinary  expenses, I am satisfied, are in the best interests of the Child and are reasonable in regard to the means of the spouses.

[442] The respondent  seeks retroactive contribution  to these expenses, specifically expenses he incurred  from August 1, 2016 to the time of trial. This retroactive  award is appropriate in all of the circumstances.  The special and extraordinary  expenses the respondent incurred,  as set out in the Notice to Admit, are for hockey registration, after-school  care, eye glasses, trampoline registration and membership fees, and a hockey tournament  fee. The respondent  paid $2,433.84 in total for these

expenses. The claimant  is required to reimburse the respondent her proportionate share (46%) of these expenses in the amount of $1,119.57.

[443] I  am satisfied these retroactive  awards are appropriate in that the respondent did not delay seeking a Court Order for support,  did not engage in any blameworthy conduct,  and that the Child has needs in these areas. I am further  satisfied that a retroactive award would not impose undue  hardship on the claimant.  She has the means. She was fully  aware of her obligation to pay support for the Child and chose not to do so. This deliberate choice, made out of frustration  and anger, can be characterized  as blameworthy.  I cannot  over-emphasize  that child support is the right of the Child and each parent has a legal obligation to provide it.

[444] I  further  order that  for so long as the Child is eligible to receive child support, the parties will exchange:  (a) copies of their respective income tax returns  for the previous year, including  all attachments,  but not later than  June 30 each year; and (b) copies of any Notice of Assessment or Reassessment provided to them by Canada Revenue Agency, immediately upon receipt to enable the parties to adjust child support payable in accordance with the Guidelines .

## The Claimant's Claim for Retroactive Child Support from April 2015 to the end of August 2015

[445] I  am satisfied the claimant  is entitled to retroactive  support for the months  she had the Child solely in her care and the respondent  did not pay support.

[446] The claimant filed her Notice of Family Claim in April 2015, immediately putting  the respondent  on notice that she was seeking child support.  She did not engage in any blameworthy  conduct.  The respondent's belief that the claimant would soon be arrested does not relieve him of his obligation to pay support for the Child. The Child had needs and the respondent  chose not to support  him. I recognize that the respondent was, during these five months,  paying for certain expenses related to the family residence and toward family  debts. However,  this does not relieve him of his child support obligation. Those payments  will be addressed further  in these

reasons. I am further  satisfied a retroactive award will not cause him undue hardship. He has the means to pay.

[447] At an income of $82,132.00, the respondent  was obliged to pay the claimant $768.00 per month  for the support for the Child for that  five-month  period. As a result,  the respondent must pay the claimant $3,840.00 for retroactive child support.

## ISSUE #3 - DIVISION OF FAMILY PROPERTY AND DEBT

[448] The parties spent little time on the division of family  property and debt in the evidence, but their positions reflect significant areas of disagreement with respect to how family property and family  debt ought  to be divided.

## The Respondent's Position

[449] Based upon the Notice to Admit, the respondent asserts that other than  his small RRSP held at Raymond James Investments,  there is no property proven  to be excluded  in this case. The  respondent urges the court to find that  the claimant has not established that the $50,000.00 advanced by her father  in 2012 is excluded property.  He submits that by using the gift from her father to purchase the family residence, she made a 'gift of her gift' to him and the presumption of advancement applies.

[450] The respondent  submits the court should  equally  divide the family property and family debt. In  order to equalize the family  property and debts retained by each party at the time of separation, he submits the claimant should  pay him the sum of $16,685.75. The respondent  also seeks to equalize  the post separation family debt payments wherein he submits the claimant should,  in the end, also pay him $21,105.07. Utilizing  an equal sharing of the proceeds of sale from the family residence and deducting these equalization  payments,  the respondent  submits the claimant ultimately  owes him $2,878.45 and that he ought  to be entitled to keep all of the net proceeds of sale from the family  residence.

[451] With respect to the pensions owned by each party, the respondent seeks that the court order each to retain his or her own pension or, alternatively,  that their pensions be divided under the provisions of the FLA .

## The Claimant's Position

[452] With respect to family property,  the claimant submits the $50,000.00 gift from her father in 2012 and her 2008 Volkswagen Jetta ought to both be considered excluded  property and not subject to division.

[453] With respect to family debt, she asks the court to find the following debts to be the respondent's  debts alone and not family debts:

1.  The President's Choice line of credit. The claimant submits that this debt is not a family debt because the respondent 'received $30,000 from [the claimant's]  mother to pay off this LOC in April 2013. By November 2014, [the respondent]  had it back up to over 22K after making purchases solely  for his enjoyment.  This includes  hunting  trips and the travel  trailer".
2.  The claimant also asks the court to take into account that the respondent "came into the relationship  with approximately  25K of debt. He testified this amount was accurate but did not provide proof this debt was paid. [The respondent]  did not come into the relationship with any  furnishings  or any assets."

[454] The claimant does not expressly  seek an unequal  division of the remaining net family property and debt in submissions, but her pleadings seek this relief and she has included in her case authorities Bilawchuk v. Bilaw chuk ,  2014 BCSC 2067, which she urges the court to consider with respect to, among other things,  the issue of occupation rent. The claimant's submissions were minimal on this point, but I take the claimant to seek to have the court  attribute an amount  for occupation rent to the respondent  as he lived in the family residence from April 1, 2015 until  the time the family residence sold and, in this context,  consider an unequal  division.

## Legislative Framework and Legal Principles

[455] Section 81(a) of the FLA provides that,  subject to an agreement or order that provides otherwise, spouses are both entitled to family  property and are both responsible for family  debt, regardless of their respective use or contribution.

[456] Section 81(b) of the FLA s pecifies that subject to an agreement or order that provides otherwise, 'upon  separation', each spouse 'has a right to an undivided half interest in all family  property as a tenant  in common,  and is equally  responsible for family debt'.

[457] The Court of Appeal in Jaszczewska  v. Kostanski , 2016 BCCA 286 observed that by enacting the property division regime in the FLA the Legislature apparently sought  to:

[36] …simplify the division of family property, to render it more certain and predictable, and to divide property on a basis that better fits people's expectations of fairness.

[458] The definition of 'excluded  property'  and the default approach that courts may unequally  divide family  property or family  debt only  if equal division would be 'significantly  unfair' are two means the Legislature used to accomplish its goals: Jaszczewska at para. 36. I will address each of these mechanisms later in these reasons.

[459] Subject to the provision dealing with excluded property  under s. 84(1)(a) of the FLA , "family property" includes all real and personal property owned by at least one spouse on the date of separation or a beneficial interest of one spouse in property on the date of separation.

[460] Section 84(2) of the FLA identifies specific items included in the definition of family property.  Under s. 84(2)(d), this includes 'money  of a spouse in an account with a financial institution'.  Under s. 84(2)(e), this includes  a spouse's entitlement  to a pension.

- [461] Under the FLA property division scheme, a party need not establish entitlement  to an asset for it to be characterized  as family property.  A party does not have to prove contribution  to an asset or ordinary use for a family purpose. To be family property,  the court only has to determine that the property existed on the date of separation and that at least one spouse owned or had a beneficial interest in the asset: Asselin v. Roy , 2013 BCSC 1681 at para. 160.
- [462] In  other words, this definition of family property establishes a "communal  pot" of property from which  only  excluded property is removed. The  definition is a broad one, reaching all property owned (or beneficially owned) by at least one spouse at the time of separation: V.J.F. v. S.K.W .,  2016 BCCA 186 at para. 8.
- [463] Section 85 of the FLA deals with excluded  family property. The excluded family property regime was recently  described by Newbury  J.A. in V.J.F . as follows:
- [1] In this appeal, we are asked to resolve a question of statutory interpretation arising under the 'new' Family Law Act , S.B.C. 2011, c. 25 (" FLA "), which came into force in March 2013. It adopts an "excluded property" model designed to "better fit with people's expectations about what is fair" and to make family law simpler and easier to understand than the previous "family purpose" model. (Ministry of Attorney General, White Paper on Family Relations Act Reform , July  2010, at 80-2.) The basic principle intended to be applied to the property of spouses on separation is that they "keep what is theirs". Most notably, with respect to property acquired by a spouse before the marriage, only the increase in value that accrues during the spouses' cohabitation is (presumptively) divisible under the Act. The rest is "excluded property" that is presumptively not divisible.
- [464] Of relevance  to the case at bar is s. 85(1)(b.1) of the FLA which  provides:
6. 85  (1) The following is excluded from family property:

…

- (b.1) gifts to a spouse from a third party;
- [465] Section 85(2) of the FLA requires the spouse claiming that certain property is excluded  property to bear the onus of demonstrating  the property is excluded property.

[466] In Shih v. Shih , 2017 BCCA 37, our Court of Appeal confirmed the standard of proof for establishing a claim to excluded property is the "same as in any civil case - proof on a balance of probabilities": para. 42. The court emphasized in Shih that "precision" or "mathematical certainty"  is not required, but in order to discharge his or her burden,  the spouse seeking to prove property is excluded property must do so with "clear and cogent evidence": paras. 40 and 43.

[467] The inherent  challenge  identified by the court in Shih that faces many  family litigants is present in this case. Documents are unavailable  and memories have dimmed. Nevertheless,  I am permitted to draw reasonable inferences  from less than precise or certain evidence in order to do justice between the parties: paras. 41 and 44.

[468] The respondent  argues that V.J.F. is applicable and the presumption of advancement  applies in this case. In V.J.F ., the court addressed the concept of a "gift of a gift" - a situation where one spouse receives a gift from a third party and then  transfers it gratuitously  to the other spouse. The court wrote as follows:

- [49] As already mentioned, Ms. W. did not challenge the proposition that the $2 million paid or "distributed" from M.I.'s estate to Mr. F. was a gift -- i.e., a gratuitous transfer of property in which the donor retained no interest and expected no remuneration: see Peter v. Beblow [1993] 1 S.C.R. 980 at 991-2; McNamee v. McNamee 2011 ONCA 533 at para. 23. It need hardly be added that without more, a gift is not revocable by the donor: see Berdette v. Berdette (1991) 3 O.R. (3d) 513 (C.A.) at 520-1; Read v. Rayner [1943] 2 D.L.R. 225 (P.E.I.S.C.) at 231, aff'd [1943] 4 D.L.R. 803 (S.C.C.); Young v. Young (1958) 15 D.L.R. (2d) 138 (B.C.C.A.).
- [50] When property is transferred gratuitously by one spouse to the other it may be more difficult to discern the donor's intention than where the donor was a "third party". Where the evidence is insufficient or equivocal and the transfer was made by husband to wife, the law normally provides an evidentiary presumption that a gift was intended and the burden of persuasion shifts to the opposite party to rebut on the balance of probabilities: see Pecore v. Pecore 2007 SCC 17 at paras. 22 and 44. This, of course, is the presumption of advancement. In Pecore, the Court stated that this presumption, and its opposite number, the presumption of trust, "continue to have a role to play" in disputes regarding gratuitous transfers. In the words of Rothstein J. for the majority:

The presumptions provide a guide for courts in resolving disputes over transfers where evidence as to the transferor's intent in making the transfer is unavailable or unpersuasive. This may be especially

true where the transferor is deceased and thus unable to tell the court his or her intentions in effecting the transfer. In addition, as noted by Feldman J.A. in the Ontario Court of Appeal in Saylor v. Madsen Estate (2005), 261 D.L.R. (4th) 597, the advantage of maintaining the presumption of advancement and the presumption of a resulting trust is that they provide a measure of certainty and predictability for individuals who put property in joint accounts or make other gratuitous transfers. [At para. 23; emphasis added.]

[469] The court in V.J.F . went on to find that the FLA scheme does not constitute  a complete code that eliminates equitable principles relating to property.  Rather,  the FLA scheme builds on those principles. Concepts such as gifts and trusts and evidentiary  presumptions such  as the presumption of advancement  between spouses are preserved: para. 74.

[470] V.J.F. involved  a situation where the husband intentionally  transferred  his inheritance  into property owned solely by his wife. Leaving aside issues not addressed by the respondent,  including  whether  the presumption  of advancement applies to common-law  spouses (which  is unresolved  in the jurisprudence),  the more fundamental  distinguishing feature is that in the case at bar, the claimant transferred her excluded property,  her gift from her father,  into property held by the parties jointly.

[471] Several recent authorities have considered this type of scenario and found that if the recipient spouse contributes  some or all of the gift/inheritance/settlement toward purchasing  a family residence that both spouses jointly  own and, if that spouse can meet his or her evidentiary burden  under s. 85(2) of the FLA , then the amount contributed remains that spouse's excluded property.  In  these circumstances,  where both parties retain title to the asset purchased  partially with the excluded property,  the presumption of advancement,  the concept of a 'gift of a gift' from V.J.F. has been found  not to apply: Kalmiakov v. Shylova ,  2016 BCSC 2095; Lahdekorpi v. Lahdekorpi , 2016 BCSC 2143; Shih v. Shih , 2015 BCSC 2108, aff'd in part 2017 BCCA 37; K.R. v. J.D ., 2017 BCSC 182; and Oleksiewicz  v. Oleksiewicz ,  2017 BCSC 228.

[472] Similarly, if a spouse uses excluded  property to pay down family debts then the amount  the spouse paid from the excluded  property remains that person's excluded  property: L.A.F. v. E.H.D ., 2015 BCSC 1450 at paras. 21, 23, and 110-113.

[473] In Kalmiakov ,  MacNaughton  J. found that the wife's mother  had gifted her daughter  $65,000.00 to use as a down payment  on the family  residence. The court noted that the sum was 'readily traceable and capable of mathematical certainty' and held that the wife was entitled to an additional $65,000.00 in excluded  property from the proceeds of sale of the family home (at para 94).

[474] In Lahdekorpi , Harris J. distinguished V.J.F. and found  the wife's $30,000.00 inheritance,  used to partly  purchase a jointly  held property,  could not reasonably be said to have intended to gift her inheritance  to her husband.  It  remained excluded property.  In this regard, the court  wrote:

- [93] At trial the claimant expressly conceded that $30,000 of the parties' property was excluded property under s. 85(1)(b) of the FLA as the respondent derived this amount from an inheritance from her mother. Subsequently, after the trial concluded and as a result of the decision of the Court of Appeal in V.J.F. v. S.K.W. , 2016 BCCA 186, the claimant sought to retract this concession on the basis that the inheritance was used to purchase a previous matrimonial home (on Shirley Road in Thunder Bay) and, therefore, lost its character as excluded property. He contends that the $30,000 inheritance is subject to equal division between the parties, along with other family property.
- [94] The case before the court in V.J.F. involved an inheritance. More significantly, in that case the Court found that there was a gift of property to the wife where the husband intentionally transferred title to her. The property was registered solely in the wife's name. In the instant case, the Shirley Road property was purchased, in part, with the respondent's $30,000 inheritance and the property was registered jointly in both their names. In my view, the joint tenancy effectively preserved her contribution to the property, which was purchased for approximately $130,000. In these circumstances, I am not persuaded that the respondent could reasonably be said to have intended to gift her inheritance to the claimant. I note that, although the parties purchased subsequent properties using, in part, income derived from the Shirley Road property, the properties were either held jointly or in the sole name of the respondent. In my view, the $30,000 used in the purchase of the Shirley Road property can be traced back to the inheritance, such that it does not lose its character as an inheritance.

[475] In Shih , Warren J. found that the wife had received a gift of $100,000.00 from her mother, and that  she had used $80,000.00 of this gift toward the purchase of the family home (paras 104-106). The court also found  that the wife had received a gift of $100,000.00 from her father.  The wife invested the vast majority of this gift in a mutual  fund,  then used the money  to purchase  a condominium,  then  sold the condominium and put $84,933.00 toward reducing the mortgage on the family home (which  the parties had already purchased)  (paras 97-102). The court held that in these circumstances,  both gifts remained Ms. Shih's excluded property.

[476] The Court of Appeal allowed Mr. Shih's appeal in part, but did not disturb the trial judge's findings or conclusions  with respect to Ms. Shih's excluded property. Rather,  the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had erred in finding that the test for excluded  property required precision or mathematical  certainty.  Instead,  the test requires proof on a balance of probabilities with clear and cogent evidence. In  the result,  Mr. Shih's claim for excluded property was allowed.

[477] In K.R. v J.D. , Jenkins J. commented on two of the above cases, and also distinguished V.J.F. in concluding  that no presumption  of advancement  arises when one spouse's inheritance  is invested into property owned jointly  by that  person and his or her spouse. The court held:

- [38] Mr. Macdonnell for the respondent submits that what happens if excluded property is placed into an asset that is jointly owned by both spouses remains undecided to date in British Columbia as a result of V.J.F . I disagree. V.J.F . is distinguishable from the case before me because V.J.F . involved the investment of one spouse's inheritance into property owned solely by the other spouse. In my view, no presumption of advancement arises when one spouse's investment is put into a property that is jointly owned by that person and his/her spouse. Additionally,  courts dealing with similar facts under the FLA have deemed that spouse's initial investment as excluded property, so long as the party claiming excluded property establishes, on a balance of probabilities, the basis for and extent of the exclusion with precision: see Shih v. Shih , 2015 BCSC 2108 at paras. 64 and 103-107, aff'd 2017 BCCA 37 [ Shih ], Lahdekorpi v. Lahdekorpi , 2016 BCSC 2143 at paras. 93-94.
- [478] Section 86 of the FLA addresses family debt. It provides:
3. 86 Family debt includes all financial obligations incurred by a spouse

- (a) during the period beginning when the relationship between the spouses begins and ending when the spouses separate, and
- (b) after the date of separation, if incurred for the purpose of maintaining family property.

[479] Section 87 provides that the value  of family  property must be based upon its fair market value  (in the absence of an agreement or order specifying otherwise and except in relation to division of pensions under  Part 6 of the FLA) . The value  of the family property and family debt is to be determined as of the date of the hearing  (or date of an agreement dividing the property).  However,  the court has the discretion to depart from that date: Jaszczewska at para. 18.

[480] As I have discussed, the court must categorize property  as either family property or excluded property.  The consequences  of this categorization were explained by Newbury  J.A. in V.J.F. at para. 10:

…on separation, each spouse is generally entitled under s. 81 to an undivided half interest in family property as a tenant in common. The court may divide it unequally only if equal division would be "significantly unfair" having regard to all the factors listed in ss. 95(2) and (3). Excluded property in contrast must not be divided unless it would be significantly unfair not to divide it having regard to only two factors -- the duration of the parties' relationship and any direct contribution by a spouse to the preservation or maintenance of the property (s. 96(b)). …

[481] Sections 95(2) and (3) of the FLA set out the factors the court may consider if a party applies for unequal  division:

- (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the Supreme Court may consider one or more of the following:
2. (a) the duration of the relationship between the spouses;
3. (b) the terms of any agreement between the spouses, other than an agreement described in section 93 (1) [setting aside agreements respecting property division];
4. (c) a spouse's contribution to the career or career potential of the other spouse;
5. (d) whether family debt was incurred in the normal course of the relationship between the spouses;
6. (e) if the amount of family debt exceeds the value of family property, the ability  of each spouse to pay a share of the family debt;

- (f) whether a spouse, after the date of separation, caused a significant decrease or increase in the value of family property or family debt beyond market trends;
- (g) the fact that a spouse, other than a spouse acting in good faith,
- (i) substantially reduced the value of family property, or
- (ii) disposed of, transferred or converted property that is or would have been family property, or exchanged property that is or would have been family property into another form, causing the other spouse's interest in the property or family property to be defeated or adversely affected;
- (h) a tax liability  that may be incurred by a spouse as a result of a transfer or sale of property or as a result of an order;
- (i) any other factor, other than the consideration referred to in subsection (3), that may lead to significant unfairness.
- (3) The Supreme Court may consider also the extent to which the financial means and earning capacity of a spouse have been affected by the responsibilities and other circumstances of the relationship between the spouses if, on making a determination respecting spousal support, the objectives of spousal support under section 161 [ objectives of spousal support ] have not been met.

[482] In Jaszczewska , the Court of Appeal declined to define the test of 'significant unfairness'  too precisely to avoid disqualifying  whatever  circumstances  might appear in future  cases, but said that 'reapportionment  will require something objectively  unjust,  unreasonable  or unfair in some important or substantial  sense': para. 42. The court in Jaszczewska went  on to explain:

- [43] The determination of whether an equal division would be significantly unfair is also guided by a more precise identification of relevant factors than was found in the FRA . Importantly, the Legislature did not include in s. 95(2) the principle of relative contribution found in s. 65(1)(f) of the FRA . Under s. 65(1)(f), a court could consider circumstances relating to the acquisition, preservation, maintenance, improvement or use of property. Section 95(2), by comparison, refers rather narrowly to career contributions (95(2)(c)) and to post-separation increases in value beyond market trends caused by one spouse (95(2)(f)). I agree with the judge's view that if relative contribution to the acquisition, preservation, maintenance or improvement of family property during the relationship was intended to be a significant factor or one frequently relied on in justifying the conclusion that the equal division of family property is significantly unfair, the Legislature would have said so. Allowing relative contribution to become a regular consideration in the context of s. 95 would likely create uncertainty and complexity. This would be contrary to the legislative objectives discussed earlier that underlie the FLA division of property regime.

- [44] Having said that, in enacting s. 95(2)(i) the Legislature recognized that there may be factors other than those listed that could ground significant unfairness. Hence, while the Legislature intended to limit and constrain the exercise of judicial discretion to depart from equal division, it did not provide a closed list of factors and it did not eliminate the discretion. Accordingly, in my view, one cannot read the FLA as abolishing unequal contribution as a factor that may be relevant to reapportionment, although the circumstances in which it may be considered and relied on are intended to be much constrained.
- [483] The claimant raised the issue of occupation rent in her closing submissions. As it was not a claim contained within  her pleadings and not raised until  closing submissions, the respondent had no notice of it.

[484] The proper approach to the issue of occupation rent and the factors to consider was discussed by Smith J.A., in concurring  reasons, in Shen v. Tong , 2013 BCCA 519 at paras. 91-94. With regard to the factors a court is to consider, Smith J.A. held:

- [94] A non-exhaustive list of potentially relevant factors in assessing a claim for occupation rent includes: (i) whether there has been ouster (although several authorities have indicated that this is not a requirement); (ii) whether children are residing with the occupying spouse; (iii) whether the occupying spouse has made a claim for contribution from the non-occupying spouse for the expenses related to the premises; (iv) whether child and/or spousal support was being paid by the non-occupying spouse; (v) whether the occupying spouse increased the selling value of the property; (vi) the duration of the occupancy; and (vii) any other competing claims: Oyama ; Casey v. Casey , 2013 SKCA 58, 417 Sask. R. 34; Griffiths v. Zambosco (2001), 54 O.R. (3d) 397 (C.A.); J.A.H. v. R.H., 2005 BCSC 1713, [2005] B.C.J. No. 2667; Donovan; and Carmichael v. Carmichael , 2005 NSSC 318, 238 N.S.R. (2d) 195. The objective of an award for occupation rent is to do what is "just and equitable" between the parties, albeit within the parameters of s. 65(1) of the FRA : Stasiewski v. Stasiewski, 2007 BCCA 205, 67 B.C.L.R. (4th) 81 at para. 33.
- [485] In Holland v. Holland , 2017 BCCA 75, the Court summarized and endorsed Smith J.A.'s approach to this issue:
- [23] In Shen v. Tong , 2013 BCCA 519, Smith J.A. (in concurring reasons) discussed how to approach the question of occupational rent. She noted at para. 91 that a claim for occupational rent is not a stand-alone claim, but is generally considered in the context of a reapportionment claim. Section 95 of the FLA provides for an unequal division of property when an equal division would be "significantly unfair". The purpose of occupational rent is "to do what is just and equitable between the parties": Shen at para. 94.

- [24] The trial judge's order in this case has the occupational rent as a "stand-alone" order, which according to Shen is an error. Perhaps more importantly, Ms. Holland did not make a claim for occupational rent in her pleadings, and it was not raised until she filed her new trial brief shortly before the trial. One of the purposes of pleadings is to give the other side notice of the claim. This was not done in this case. There was no notice of the claim until very shortly before the trial. I would allow the appeal on this ground, and set aside the order for occupational rent.

[486] The respondent  seeks an Order in relation to the parties' pensions. Part 6 of the FLA and the Divisions of Pension Regulation ,  B.C. Reg. 348/2012 made under the FLA sets out the regime for dividing pensions in a family law case. Section 81 of the FLA indicates that the general rule for equally  dividing family property does not apply to pensions. Instead,  the kind of pension plan (e.g. defined benefit, defined contribution,  or hybrid)  determines what  rules on division apply. Under s. 111(1) of the FLA , if a spouse is entitled to an interest in pension benefits then the court must determine the spouse's share and the manner  of satisfying the entitlement  under Part 6 of the FLA , unless  an agreement between the spouses or court order provides otherwise.

[487] With this framework in mind, I turn  to the specific issues in this case.

## Analysis

## What is Included  in Family Property?

[488] Other than  the family residence, which  sold in 2016, the  parties only  tendered evidence with respect to the value  of certain property as at the time of separation. Accordingly,  these are the values the court must use.

[489] There is no dispute the following  assets are family  property subject to division:

1.  Canada Savings Bond retained by the claimant - $1800;
2.  Interior  Savings bank account partly  retained by the claimant and partly retained by the respondent.  The claimant retained the sum of $1,103.82 and the respondent retained the sum of $89.57;

3.  Valley First Credit Union chequing account  retained by the respondent  $1,277.14;
4.  2005 Toyota Tacoma motor vehicle retained by the respondent  - $10,000;
5.  2001 Surveyor  travel trailer retained by the respondent  - $11,000.
6.  Apple Computer and accessories retained by the claimant - $2,500;
7.  Family residence sold in 2016 - $76,270.88 (net sale proceeds);
8.  Pensions owned by each party - no values  given

[490] The claimant does not dispute that the respondent's RRSP held at Raymond James Investments  in the amount  of nearly  $8,000.00 is excluded  property.

[491] The following  property is in dispute:

1.  The claimant asserts that a $50,000.00 gift from her father is excluded property;
2.  The claimant also asserts that the 2008 Volkswagen Jetta motor vehicle that she retained is excluded property.

[492] I  will  deal first with the $50,000.00 gift. I have found  N.M. made a gift of these funds  to the claimant only.  He had no intention  of gifting any funds  to the respondent.  I am satisfied the claimant  has established this gift was excluded property under  s. 85(1)(b.1) of the FLA when  she received it from her father in 2012.

[493] I  am further  satisfied that  this gift did not lose its character as excluded property when  the claimant used it toward the purchase  of the family residence and likely for the payment  of family  debts. Unlike V.J.F ., the claimant did not use her father's gift to intentionally  purchase property solely in the respondent's name. She used it primarily to invest  in a property jointly  owned by her and to pay debts jointly owed by her. I am satisfied on the evidence as a whole that the claimant did not intend to gift her father's gift to the respondent  in these circumstances.  I cannot infer

that her use of the funds  was a reflection  of any intention  to make a gift to the respondent.  The family residence was registered in both names, with the unequally divided interest specified, in order to secure the necessary financing  for the purchase,  to take advantage of the claimant's status as a first time home buyer,  to ensure their shared obligation under  the mortgage and to reflect  their choice to share a home in which  to raise the children.  Like the situations in Kalmiakov , Lahdekorpi , Shih, K.R. and Oleksiewicz,  V.J.F . is distinguishable  from the case at bar and the presumption  of advancement  does not arise. The claimant has established that  the $50,000.00 gift from her father in 2012 is excluded  property.

[494] With respect to the 2008 Volkswagen Jetta motor vehicle,  I find the claimant has not established that  this property is excluded  property. There is no evidence before the court to support the claimant's assertion in her submissions that  "this asset was acquired through  the estate of [the claimant's] late grandmother…".  It will be included in family property  and has a value  of $9,500.00.

[495] The total value of the assets held between the two parties and which they have identified in these proceedings is $113,541.41. I deduct from this amount  the claimant's excluded property of $50,000.00. This means the total value of family property to be divided is $63,541.41, plus the accrued interest.

## What is Included  in Family Debt?

[496] There is no dispute the following  are family debts within  the meaning of s. 86(a) of the FLA:

1.  Interior  Savings Credit Union MasterCard held in the name of the respondent and retained by the respondent - $4,297.23;
2.  Valley First Credit Union MasterCard held in the name of the respondent  and retained by the respondent  - $3,086.87;
3.  American Express credit card held in the name of the respondent and retained by the respondent  - $38.73:

4.  Valley First Credit Union line of credit in the name of the respondent  and retained by the respondent  - $7,964.33;
5.  Valley First Credit Union line of credit [number  2] held in the name of the respondent  and retained by the respondent  - $2,302.65.

[497] The claimant urges me to conclude  that another debt set out in the Notice to Admit - the President's Choice line of credit held in the name of the respondent and retained by the respondent  in the amount of $23,144.58 - is not family debt. In  this regard, she submits that the respondent received $30,000 in April 2013 to pay off this line of credit and that "by November  2014, [the respondent]  had it back up to over $22,000.00 after making purchases solely for his enjoyment".  However,  the claimant then  goes on to submit that  the same $30,000 received from her mother in April 2013 was used to "pay the debt in the respondent's  name that "pre-existed"'.

[498] I  am unable to agree with the claimant here. Even if the evidence supported either of these assertions (which  it does not), the fact remains that  this President's Choice line of credit debt was incurred during the parties' relationship and before separation. It is a family  debt under  s. 86(a) of the FLA .

[499] Pursuant  to the Notice to Admit, the following  expenses the respondent paid toward maintaining  family property are family debts under s.86(b) of the FLA :

1.  Valley First Credit Union line of credit - interest payments  from the date of separation to August 31, 2016 - $634.03;
2.  Valley First Credit Union MasterCard - date of separation to February 12, 2015 - $275.51;
3.  Interior  Savings Credit Union MasterCard interest payments  from the date of separation to August 12, 2015 - $657.04;
4.  President's Choice line of credit interest payments  from the date of separation to August 31, 2016 - $2960.11;

5.  Valley First Credit Union loan interest from the date of separation to October 9, 2015 - $31.26;
6.  Mortgage payments to Valley First Credit Union  April 10, 2015 to the sale of the former family  home - $33,028.10;
7.  Homeowners insurance from April 10, 2015 to the sale of the former family home - $1,295.00;
8.  Life insurance  payments  from April 10, 2015 to August  30, 2016 - $1,677.64;
9.  House and yard maintenance  expenses from April 10, 2015 to the sale of the former family home - $1439.79; and
10.  Disability insurance  payments  from April 10, 2015 to September 8, 2016 $449.51.
- [500] The respondent  alone paid these admitted family  debts.

[501] The total value of the family debt is $83,282.38. This sum comprises family debts the respondent  now has solely in his name and expenses he alone paid toward maintaining  family property after separation. As noted, this latter category is considered family debt under s. 86(b) of the FLA.

## Division of Family Property and Family Debt

[502] I  am satisfied that dividing family property  and family debt equally  between the parties would not be 'significantly  unfair'  as the jurisprudence  has considered that phrase and considering the factors in ss. 95(2) and (3) of the FLA .

[503] The claimant seeks unequal  division. She does not identify any specific factors in s. 95(2) of the FLA in support of her position, but I infer from her pleadings and her closing submissions that she seeks unequal  division in her favour  for two reasons. The first was identified in her pleadings. Her pleadings contain one ground for unequal  division of family property  and family debt. These pleadings were drafted by her first lawyer  and not amended by her second lawyer.  This ground relates to

the $50,000.00 gift she received from her father  in 2012. I have already considered this gift and determined it is excluded  property and not subject to division. The second was identified in the claimant's closing submissions, when  she referred to occupation rent. As this claim is generally  considered in a reapportionment  claim, I infer that she seeks to have an unequal  distribution of family property and family debt in her favour  to account for the respondent's occupation of the family residence since the time of separation.

[504] The difficulty  with this submission is that it was raised for the first time in closing arguments.  The purpose of pleadings is to give the opposing party fair notice an issue will be raised at trial. It was not raised, so the respondent  had no opportunity  to call evidence in relation to factors a court is to consider for such a claim. I do not have the tools necessary  to consider such  a claim and to do so would be unfair  to the respondent.

[505] In  the end, I am not convinced  that equal division would create a situation that is 'objectively  unjust,  unreasonable  or unfair  in some important or substantial sense': Jaszczewska at para. 42. There will be an equal division of family property and family debt, but I do find that each party must account  to the other for certain expenses incurred after the date of separation.

[506] Leaving aside their employment  pensions, I have found  that the total value of family property is $63,541.41, plus the interest that has accrued on the net proceeds of sale of the former family residence. Equally  dividing these amounts means each party would be entitled to $31,770.71 of family property,  plus one half of the interest accrued. Yet this is not the end of the analysis as the parties must account to each other for their share of the family property they  have retained, family debts and certain expenses.

[507] I  order that each party is to keep the family property currently  in their possession. The claimant has retained family property worth  $14,903.82. She is thus entitled to an additional $16,866.89 in family property. The respondent  has retained

family property worth  $22,366.71. He is thus  entitled to an additional $9,404.00 in family property.

[508] With respect to their pensions, each party is contributing  to their employment pensions. Each party is entitled to a share of the other's pension benefits. However, very  little evidence was adduced on this topic and very  little time was spent in submissions on it. The claimant made no submissions on the topic. Given the lack of evidence and the position of the claimant, I will accede to the respondent's primary position that each party retain their own pensions. On what little evidence there is, I see nothing  unfair  in doing so.

[509] I  now turn  to a division of the family debts. I have  found that the total value of the family debts is $83,282.38. Equally  dividing this amount means that each party would be responsible for $41,641.19 of the family debt. The respondent  has assumed total responsibility for these debts and so the claimant must compensate him for her half of the family debts.

[510] The claimant owes the respondent a certain amount  for expenses for which she is solely  responsible. The claimant's former counsel Mr. David Paul registered a judgment  against the former family residence amounting  to $3,843.21. The claimant also was ordered to pay the respondent  $2,500.00 in costs in the orders of August  2, 2016. Both of these amounts  were paid out of the sale proceeds of the former family residence. The total of these two amounts  is $6,343.21. If it were not for these expenses the respondent would have  been entitled to half of the additional sale proceeds. Accordingly, the claimant owes him $3,171.61.

[511] To conclude  here, the claimant owes the respondent $41,641.19 for her share of the family  debts. To this amount  I add $3,171.61 for the expenses for which the claimant is solely responsible. The claimant ultimately  owes the respondent $44,812.80 to equalize family  debts.

[512] There is $76,270.88, plus a small amount  of interest earned on that  amount currently  held in a trust account  with the respondent's lawyer.  This amount

represents the net proceeds of sale from the former family residence. The sale proceeds were $430,092.33. From this amount,  the mortgage on the former family residence in the amount  of $339,813.67, outstanding  taxes, outstanding  city utility payments,  conveyancing  costs, the judgment  of Mr. Paul, and the costs ordered payable to the respondent  have been paid.

[513] From the $76,270.88 held in trust,  the claimant is entitled  to $16,866.89 as her share of the family property and the respondent is entitled to $9,404.00 as his share. This would leave $50,000.00 remaining in the trust account.  This amount represents the claimant's excluded  property.  However,  the claimant has a duty  to pay the respondent  $44,812.80 for her share of the family debt. She is to fulfil  this obligation out of her excluded  property, leaving $5,187.20 in her excluded property.

[514] I,  therefore,  order that the claimant is to receive $22,054.09 from the funds held in trust after the sale of the former family  residence. I order that the respondent is to receive $54,216.80 from the funds held in trust.  I further  order that each party is to receive one-half  of the interest that has accrued on the sale proceeds.
