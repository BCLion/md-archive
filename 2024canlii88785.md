## ISSUES

- [1] To decide these applications I must address: (1) whether it is in M.K.'s best interests to switch her primary residence from E.C.'s home to T.K.'s home commencing September 2024, given M.K.'s request to change residences; (2) whether parental responsibilities should be changed to a shared arrangement; (3) whether T.K. owes E.C. retroactive child support, and if so, for what period of time; and (4) what amount of child support should be paid on a go-forward basis, and by whom. This last issue will necessarily depend on what I decide about M.K.'s ongoing residence.

## BACKGROUND

- [2] The parties were in a common-law relationship for roughly four and a half years between 2009 and 2014. M.K. is their only child. She was born [omitted for posting]. She turned 13 last month.
- [3] Prior to separation, the parties and M.K. resided in the rural community of [omitted for posting], BC. After they separated, T.K. moved to [omitted for posting] and E.C. and M.K. remained in [omitted for posting]. They formalized the parenting arrangement whereby M.K. would continue to reside with E.C. by way of a final consent order made by the Honourable Judge Koturbash on September 30, 2014. The order also gave E.C. all of the parental responsibilities as set out in s. 41 of the Family Law Act (' FLA '), except that T.K. may make day-to-day decisions affecting M.K. and may have day-to-day care, control, and supervision of M.K. when she is in his care for parenting time.
- [4] In the ten years that followed, the parties returned to court numerous times either to deal with issues involving T.K.'s parenting time, or to deal with changes to child support and arrears that over time became owing by T.K. The question of whether M.K. should continue to live with E.C. never became an issue until August 2023, and that was only after E.C. filed an application to enforce and review the financial obligations that arose out of an April 24, 2019 court order.

- [5] Paragraphs 5 through 11 of the April 2019 order are of particular relevance. They set T.K.'s income at $66,000; they obligate him to pay $626 per month in child support commencing May 1, 2019; they obligate him to provide E.C. with his 2018 income tax documents once they become available; and they obligate him to file updated financial disclosure by May 8, 2019. Paragraph 10 of that order permits the parties to adjust the amount of child support payable by T.K. should any differences arise as a result of his 2018 income disclosure, and paragraph 11 obligates T.K. to provide E.C. with his Income Tax Return and Notice of Assessment every year thereafter by May 31.
- [6] E.C. claims she never received the required financial disclosure either voluntarily from T.K., or in response to her follow-up requests. His lack of compliance prompted her to file an Application About Enforcement on August 4, 2023, and an Application About a Family Law Matter on August 9, 2023. Through her applications, E.C. claims retroactive child support from May 31, 2018, as well as prospective child support based on an imputed income.

[7] Those two applications prompted a sequence of events. First, on August 9, the same day E.C. filed her application, the Ministry of Child and Family Development ('MCFD') received a report alleging poor hygiene of M.K. while in her mother's care, and poor living conditions. E.C. alleges that T.K. made this report.

- [8] Then, on August 15, 2023, T.K. picked up M.K. for his parenting time and failed to return her to E.C.'s care. He also enrolled M.K. in [omitted for posting] school without consulting E.C.
- [9] On August 24, 2023, E.C. filed a court application for M.K's return. The next day MCFD received another incident report. The incident report indicates that the call came from someone who is closely connected to T.K. The caller advised that the child came to them a week ago and is refusing to go back to mom's house. The caller also shared that T.K. has court on August 30 and would be asking for interim residency so that M.K. can stay with him and go to school.

- [10] The next day MCFD received a report from the K. household alleging physical abuse by E.C. to M.K.
- [11] MCFD investigated all of the reports and found no protection concerns.
- [12] T.K. reluctantly returned M.K. to E.C.'s care around September 8, 2023, but by that point M.K. had already attended a couple of days of school in [omitted for posting], missed the first couple of days of school in [omitted for posting], and she had missed her 4H activities.
- [13] In this same timeframe, on August 30, 2023, T.K. filed a Reply. In his Reply, he explained his lack of compliance with the disclosure obligations and agreed to E.C.'s request to change child support. However, he based his agreement to vary child support on grounds that his cost of living had gone up and that M.K.'s living arrangements would soon be changing. He counterclaimed with applications to change M.K.'s residence and that E.C. pay child support to him.
- [14] T.K. now resides in [omitted for posting] with his partner, S.B., and two of her children. He just recently moved to [omitted for posting] from [omitted for posting] this past July.

## PRIMARY RESIDENCE AND PARENTING TIME

- [15] Dealing first with T.K.'s application to change M.K.'s residence, the following points are central to his application:
1.  First and foremost, T.K. says M.K. has clearly expressed to both parents, to other family members, and to the author of the Hear the Child Report that she wants to live with him. He argues that the court ought to accept those views and allow M.K. to switch residences;
2.  T.K. points out that M.K. has spent the last ten or so years primarily resident with E.C., and argues for reasons of fairness that M.K. should now be permitted to live with him;
3.  T.K. relies on E.C.'s history with MCFD, and raises ongoing concerns about her housing, her tendency to defer to corporal punishment, and about M.K.'s hygiene while in E.C.'s care;

4.  T.K. claims that E.C. does not share relevant information about M.K. with him, and gave an example of E.C. not sharing the post-operative instructions with him following M.K.'s nasal surgery; and
5.  T.K. expresses concern that E.C. does not consult with him about M.K.'s extracurricular activities, particularly when those activities interfere with his parenting time.
- [16] E.C. opposes the application to change M.K.'s residence, and believes it is in M.K.'s best interests to remain in her care indefinitely, and at least for the upcoming academic year. The following points are central to her response:
1.  E.C. acknowledges that M.K. has expressed a desire to live with T.K., but feels M.K. is being disingenuous and is making the request solely to appease T.K. and S.B. as a result of the constant pressure that M.K. receives from them;
2.  E.C. argues that she has always been M.K.'s primary caregiver, and says there is nothing about M.K.'s circumstances that warrant a change to the current arrangements outside of M.K.'s pressured views. She points to the timing of T.K.'s application, noting that M.K.'s residence was never an issue until 2023, and only after E.C. applied to deal with the financial issues;
3.  E.C. testified that M.K. is doing very well in her care, socially and academically. She argues that a change of residence would disrupt M.K.'s routine and not be in M.K.'s best interests;
4.  E.C. says that T.K. is confrontational, particularly when finances are involved. She testified that in addition to his failure to comply with financial-disclosure obligations, and his failure to pay Guideline child support, he contributes nothing towards M.K.'s 4H, gymkhana, or dance activities despite that M.K. has been enrolled in these activities for years. E.C. also summarized the extent to which M.K. has been involved in other activities and programs over the past nine to ten years. T.K. acknowledged the extent to which M.K. has been involved in various other activities and did not dispute that he has not contributed financially to them;
5.  E.C. expressed concern about T.K.'s ability to co-parent, and added that he disrespects her authority to make the final decision on parenting responsibilities. She referenced examples of his inconsistency and unwillingness to cooperate with timely pick up and drop off, particularly around gymkhana, and claims that he oversteps in his ability to make decisions for M.K. even when it is not his parenting time.
6.  E.C. expressed concern that T.K. consistently uses M.K. as a messenger particularly when the topic of discussion involves important issues, such as changing residences and/or the need for M.K. to attend her extracurricular activities;
7.  E.C. testified that T.K. discusses with M.K. court-related topics, such as child support and where she should live, and argues that T.K. inappropriately

- encouraged M.K. to assert her own authority beyond what was reasonable and acceptable for a (then) 12-year-old girl; and
8.  E.C. says that T.K.'s words and actions place unnecessary pressure on M.K., that M.K. is caught in the centre of the conflict, and that the pressure from T.K. and S.B. to switch residences is the driving force behind M.K.'s request to change residences.

## ANALYSIS

- [17] Sections 37, 38, and 47 of the Family Law Act guide my decision on the parenting issues.
- [18] Section 47 allows the court, on application, to change, suspend, or terminate an order respecting parenting arrangements if satisfied that there has been a change in the needs or circumstances of the child, including because of a change in the circumstances of another person.
- [19] The burden of proving the change in the child's needs or circumstances is with the applicant.
- [20] Counsel for T.K. also relies on the analysis set out in Gordon v. Goertz , 1996 2 SCR 27, to determine whether there has been a material change in circumstances since the making of the 2014 order. Counsel also refers to case law from our Court of Appeal, including Williamson v. Williamson , 2016 BCCA 87, which supports the legal principle that a change alone is not enough; the change must have altered the child's needs or the ability of the parent to meet those needs in a fundamental way.
- [21] Absent a material change in the needs or circumstances of the child, the inquiry can go no further. If, however, the court finds that a material change has occurred, the judge on the new application can embark on a fresh inquiry into the best interests of the child.
- [22] At the time of the 2014 order, M.K. was three. She is now 13, certainly more mature, and largely capable of expressing her views. Her view is that she would like to live with T.K.

- [23] On these facts alone, I am satisfied that M.K.'s circumstances have materially changed since the last parenting order such that I have grounds to embark on a fresh inquiry as to what is in her best interests.
- [24] In doing so, I remind both parents that the law requires me not to consider what is best for E.C. or for T.K., but only to consider what is in the best interests of M.K. Section 37(2) of the FLA sets out a non-exhaustive list of the factors that I must consider in determining her best interests.
- [25] I will turn to those factors now.

## a)  Child's health and emotional well-being

- [26] Aside from her nasal issues which are largely resolved, M.K. is physically healthy and an otherwise thriving teenager.
- [27] Her report cards (included in Exhibit 2) confirm her regular school attendance and describe her as a supportive peer who works to the best of her abilities. The November 2023 report card identifies M.K. as a 'silent leader' with significant potential.
- [28] The June 2023 report card reiterates M.K.'s positive attitude and focus. A testament to her potential and drive is the fact that she made the honour roll in the fall 2023 semester despite the [omitted for posting] disruption to the start of her school year. Her ambition and drive is further apparent through the unauthorized choice she made to partake in track and field events last year and within days of her nasal surgery, a decision that resulted in a second place win.
- [29] Despite how well she does socially and academically, both parents have described M.K. as someone who, on occasion, becomes defiant. E.C. is of the view that M.K. suffers from ODD; however, there is no medical evidence to support that.
- [30] Having heard from both parties, I am confident that any attitude M.K. does exhibit is, in large part, a result of her being placed directly in the middle of the conflict.

- [31] The fact that M.K. has done so well in school over the last year, amidst a period of time when she has been in the centre of parental conflict, speaks not only to her strengths and capabilities, but also to the importance of structure and routine to her overall health and well-being.

## b)  Child's views

- [32] The Hear the Child Report filed November 6, 2023 depicts M.K. much the same as her teachers view her; that is, smart, insightful, and caring. The report assures me that M.K. loves T.K. and E.C. equally. She made it clear to the report author that she enjoys her time at each household that ideally she would like to spend equal time with both parents, that she does not like the conflict between her parents and that she wants it to stop.
- [33] M.K. appears to be of the view that the conflict will stop if she lives with her dad. She told the report writer that the current arrangements are not fair because she has spent ten years with her mom already, and only two years with her dad (referring to the time prior to separation). She is hopeful once the court knows her views that, '. . . court will go away sooner'.

## c)  The nature and strength of the relationships between the child and significant persons in that child's life

- [34] The evidence supports M.K. having a close relationship with S.B, S.B.'s children (and grandchild), with T.K. and his parents, and with his extended family who reside in [omitted for posting] and surrounding areas. Likewise, at E.C.'s home, M.K. has the love and support of her mother and older brother N.C., and of E.C.'s extended family.
- [35] In summary, there is no shortage of the number of people that care for M.K., and I am satisfied that she will be surrounded by love and support regardless of whose home she resides in.

## d)  History of the child's care

[36] It is undisputed that M.K. has been in E.C.'s sole care since she was two, and enjoys consistent parenting time with T.K. on alternating weekends, holidays, and additional weeklong periods in the summer months.

[37] It is also undisputed that throughout the time that M.K. has resided with E.C., E.C. has enrolled M.K. in a variety of activities and programs and paid for these out of her own pocket.

[38] E.C. owns horses, and her passion for horses and rural lifestyles have enabled M.K. to grow up with the experience of a western lifestyle. As such, over the years, many of M.K.'s activities involved horseback riding and related sporting events, such as gymkhana and 4H.

- [39] Both T.K. and S.B. recognize that M.K. loves her horse, and that she enjoyed 4H when enrolled. E.C. testified that M.K. also enjoys gymkhana. T.K. testified that M.K. typically enjoys gymkhana, but believes something has changed over the last year because M.K. has not wanted to go. He expressed concern that people yell and criticize the young riders at the events. His mother, K.K., gave similar evidence and testified that M.K. gets frustrated when her horse does not behave, that M.K. gets frustrated when she does not do well, and that she gets upset when she is yelled at and reprimanded by other adults.
- [40] I am very familiar with these types of activities. They require a significant amount of time, commitment, and money, over and above the responsibility and endless costs of owning and maintaining a horse. Safety is always top of mind for the contestants, but perhaps more often for the parents. My personal experience is that when parent spectators yell, they do so because they want the rider (who is racing around the large arena on a thousand-pound animal) to be able to actually hear the words of caution and encouragement that are being spoken.

[41] T.K.'s evidence convinces me that any frustrations that M.K. experiences with gymkhana are not hers, but his. In the last year, E.C. has invited him to attend M.K.'s

award ceremony and yearend banquet. Not only did he ignore the repeated invite requests, but also he chose not to attend. He testified that it was so much time out of his weekend already, and that M.K. did not want to go. The truth is it was not a priority for T.K. to attend the event; he chose instead to attend his birthday plans in [omitted for posting].

- [42] It is evident from listening to T.K. that he views gymkhana as an inconvenience. It is also clear this was not always the case. E.C. testified that there was no stress around this event (none at least that she was aware of) prior to July 2023. T.K. did not dispute that.
- [43] However, he now raises concerns that gymkhana takes up half of his weekends, and that it takes away from his parenting time. He said when it falls on his weekend, he ends up spending most of his Saturdays in [omitted for posting], and that does not account for all of the driving that he has to do to get to [omitted for posting] from [omitted for posting] or [omitted for posting], and then back again. His evidence is that he would much prefer to be doing something else when M.K. is with him, and gave quadding as an example.
- [44] I asked T.K. what his plans are around gymkhana if M.K. were to live with him. He answered that she has already expressed to him that she does not want to continue, but he will let her decide. He said that if she maintains that she does not want to continue with this activity, he would not make her.
- [45] T.K. is supportive of M.K.'s dance, which she does in [omitted for posting], and he supports M.K. continuing with that event if she were to live with him.

## e)  The child's need for stability

- [46] All children thrive from stability and M.K. is no exception. She has a regular school and extracurricular routine in E.C.'s care.
- [47] E.C. is a certified education assistant and works just shy of six hours per day, Monday through Friday, at [omitted for posting] Elementary School in [omitted for

posting]. She is finished work by the time M.K. finishes school. She is off weekends, and does not work in the summer. As a result, E.C. is the person primarily responsible for M.K.'s care during her parenting time.

- [48] By contrast, T.K. is a full-time trucker and spends most nights of the week on the road. He does not have a set schedule, but is generally home on weekends.
- [49] His partner, S.B., works full time Monday to Friday, 9-5, as a medical office assistant.
- [50] If M.K. lives at the K. residence, she will be supervised by S.B.'s 21-year-old daughter I, and kept company by S.B.'s 17-year-old son R., when T.K. is away and while S.B. is at work.
- [51] Both T.K. and S.B. testified that there would be no issues with this arrangement given the close relationship between all of the individuals.
- [52] E.C. does not agree with this proposed arrangement. She testified that shortly before the trial (June 2024), M.K. spent one and a half hours in E.C.'s bed crying. E.C. testified that M.K. said she is tired of keeping everyone at her dad's house happy, that S.B. is not as nice when T.K. is not around, and that S.B. calls M.K. selfish.
- [53] E.C. said that when M.K. had this breakdown, she did not question M.K. directly as to where she wanted to live. She recognized that M.K. has been through enough, and she did not feel it would be fair to M.K. to put her in the middle. She said M.K. simply told her that she just wants this all to be done, and that she was looking forward to grade 8 in [omitted for posting].
- [54] It is apparent to me that M.K. is trying to please each of her parents whom she loves equally, and her comments to E.C. that she just 'wants this all to be done' are consistent with the conclusions of the Hear the Child Report.
- [55] It is also apparent to me that M.K.'s structure and routine (which she has known for so long and which she does well under) will change if she goes to live with T.K. Such a change, in my view, will not be in M.K.'s best interests.

[56] All of that said, and if I had to limit myself to only one set of facts that tips the scales on this application, it is this next consideration.

## f) Ability of each person who seeks parental responsibilities or parenting time to exercise their responsibilities

[57] I will start this next point by commending both parents on those times when they have worked together in M.K.'s best interests.

- [58] T.K. is, without question, a devoted father. He communicates with M.K. regularly, is openly affectionate, and generally supportive of her needs.
- [59] E.C. is a devoted mother. She has a long history of providing M.K. with structure and routine, and in my view, E.C. ought to be commended for all of the unmentioned costs and responsibilities that she has undertaken solely on her own over the last 10 or so years. Those responsibilities include purchasing and caring for M.K.'s horse, and she has somehow managed all of that on an income that historically is far below the income enjoyed by T.K.
- [60] E.C. has consistently kept T.K. informed about M.K.'s extracurricular activities while ensuring that he has been invited to attend important events and, like T.K., has at times been willing to adjust her schedule to accommodate changes.
- [61] Unfortunately, however, each parent has at times let their conflict with the other get the best of them to the extent that it has affected their ability to exercise their parental responsibilities.
- [62] The text messages demonstrate that E.C. can be abrupt and dismissive in her communications with T.K. One example is when T.K. asked E.C. to ensure proper clothing for a visit, and E.C. responded 'I'll send her what she came to school with'. Another time T.K. asked for clarification on parenting time and E.C. curtly responded with, 'What does the calendar say?'
- [63] Rather than responding with abrupt 'do it yourself' or 'stick to the schedule' kind of remarks, it would be more helpful if E.C. could instead just answer the questions that

T.K. is asking. It would also assist if she could try to be more flexible when unexpected last-minute circumstances arise that make it difficult for T.K. to pick up and drop off at the pre-arranged times.

[64] E.C. might also consider being more adaptable when T.K. asks for additional parenting time. For example, and regardless of what other plans she may have had, E.C.'s refusal to accommodate T.K.'s 2024 Father's Day request was unfair not just to T.K., but more importantly to M.K.

[65] Turning to T.K., my concerns about his ability to exercise his parenting responsibilities go right back to his history of not living up to his child-support obligations. By 2019, T.K.'s child-support arrears had accrued to over $40,000. The parties resolved the issue by way of a consent order that had T.K. making a lump-sum payment of $32,000.

[66] Right after those financial issues were resolved on April 24, 2019, T.K. recreated the conflict almost immediately by failing to comply with his new disclosure obligations. His explanations as to why he failed to make disclosure made no sense to me; his obligations were not dependent on E.C. reciprocating the disclosure, and the court order made very clear that the disclosure was required whether E.C. asked for the disclosure or not.

[67] Because T.K. did not contribute to anything other than monthly child support, E.C. paid for various expenses for M.K. on her own. When she made requests for reimbursement by text or email, T.K. had a habit of ignoring her. E.C. often had to ask repeatedly before T.K. responded or provided payment.

[68] Then there is the issue of T.K.'s overall attitude towards M.K.'s activities. In late fall 2023, he allowed M.K. to show up for gymkhana in clothing attire that was completely inappropriate for the season or the event. On another occasion, he brought M.K. to the gymkhana arena grounds for a 10:00 a.m. start time instead of co-operating with E.C.'s request to have M.K. at her home by 9:00 a.m. When I asked T.K. to explain his reasoning for this, he explained that he arrived at the rodeo grounds at 10:00 a.m.

because otherwise it is just 'more time out of my weekend'. He added that E.C. should be able to round up and transport M.K.'s horse on her own as she is fetching her own horse anyways, and that he can save an hour by driving M.K. straight to the rodeo grounds for the 10:00 a.m. start time.

[69] I found this entire explanation to be troublesome. These are M.K.'s activities, and M.K. committed to them. Any reasonable parent would not have their child show up for a hockey game or soccer game just as the event is about to begin. By doing so the child misses warm ups, coaching tips, and comradery. In this case, M.K. also misses learning and fully appreciating the many responsibilities that come with horse ownership. Those responsibilities do not just include fetching up her horse. They include loading up all of the tack, hay, buckets, rakes, wheel barrows, brushes, snacks for the long day . . . the list goes on and on. M.K. is at an age where she can be a huge help to E.C., and I find it unreasonable for T.K. to think it is somehow okay for E.C. to shoulder both the financial and physical responsibilities that come with this activity.

[70] Added to my concerns are the text messages between T.K. and M.K. wherein he suggests to M.K. that she has the ability to decide whether she even goes to gymkhana. This communication is problematic for a couple of reasons, being: (1) M.K. already committed to participate; and (2) M.K. does not get to 'call the shots', and especially without consulting E.C.

[71] Similarly, T.K. (and to an extent S.B.) have led M.K. to believe that she can decide where she lives. This is apparent as well through the evidence and text messages. It is also apparent that T.K. has discussed the child-support issues with M.K. given the comments M.K. has made to E.C.

[72] By doing all of these things, T.K., and to the extent that she has played a role, S.B., have placed M.K. directly in the line of fire.

[73] One just has to look at the rollercoaster of emotions that M.K. is expressing through her poems and song writing, and from the types of comments that she is making to others including the report writer, to know that she is struggling emotionally.

## g), h)   These two factors in s. 37(2) deal with allegations of family violence

[74] Although T.K. has referenced several incidents of alleged physical discipline by E.C., MCFD found no protection concerns. There have been no further allegations of violence, nor is there anything in the Hear the Child Report or elsewhere in the evidence that allows me to conclude that family violence has occurred, that M.K.'s safety has been impacted, or that E.C. is impaired in her ability to care for M.K. or to meet her needs.

## i) The appropriateness of an arrangement that would require the guardians to cooperate

[75] Both parties testified that they cannot cooperate and the evidence confirms that. As such, any order that I make will necessarily include a term that allows one parent to make the final decision if they cannot otherwise agree.

## j) Any civil or criminal proceeding relevant to the child's safety, security or well-being

[76] Nothing turns on this last factor, as there are no other civil or criminal proceedings relevant to the child's safety, security, or well-being.

[77] Having considered all of the relevant factors, I am satisfied that M.K.'s request to live with T.K. is a result of the pressures that she has felt from T.K. since August 2023. M.K.'s expressed views are a direct reflection of T.K.'s views, and they mirror S.B.'s views. Further, M.K.'s views are only one factor that I must consider in determining what is in her best interests. When I consider all of the s. 37 factors as a whole, I conclude that it is in M.K.'s best interests that she continue to reside with E.C.

## CHILD SUPPORT

[78] Counsel for T.K concedes that T.K. owes arrears, and has calculated the amount owing to be $10,903 from May 1, 2019 to July 30, 2024.

- [79] E.C. says the arrears should be calculated as of May 1, 2018.

- [80] It is not clear from the April 24, 2019 order whether the Honourable Judge Phillips intended to backdate any adjustment to May 1, 2018, or whether he intended the adjustment to take effect after T.K.'s 2018 income became known.
- [81] What is clear from the evidence is that T.K.'s annual income from 2018 onwards is as follows:
- [82] Had T.K. disclosed his 2018 annual income when he received it in May of 2019, and had he thereafter disclosed his annual income tax information as the court ordered him to do by May 31 of each year, child support likely would have been adjusted annually as of July 1.
- [83] That means that T.K. would have paid child support for the last six months of 2019 based on his 2018 income, and he would have continued to pay child support at the 2018 rate for the first six months of 2020. His child support would have been adjusted on July 1, 2020 once his 2019 income became known, and he would have paid child support for the last six months of 2020 and the first six months of 2021 based on his 2019 income. This pattern would continue every year, and so it is on this basis that I have calculated the child-support arrears owing.

| YEAR     | ANNUAL INCOME   |   GUIDELINE AMOUNT |
|----------|-----------------|--------------------|
| $80,041  | $765            |               2018 |
| $78,378  | $749            |               2019 |
| $56,736  | $534            |               2020 |
| $100,790 | $953            |               2021 |
| $101,545 | $960            |               2022 |
| $82,519  | $789            |               2023 |

[84] In other words, I find that from July 1 to December 31, 2019, and from January 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020, T.K. should have paid child support based on his 2018 income of $80,041. The Guideline amount is $765 per month. He paid $626 per month. That is a difference of $139 per month, or $1,668 per year.

[85] From July 1, 2020 through to June 30, 2021, T.K. should have paid based on his 2019 Guideline income of $78,378. The Guideline amount is $749. That is a difference of $123 per month, or $1,476 per year.

[86] From July 1, 2021 through to June 30, 2022, T.K. should have paid based on his 2020 Guideline income of $56,736. The Guideline amount is $534. That is an overpayment of $92 per month, or ($1,104) per year.

[87] From July 1, 2022 through to June 30, 2023, T.K. should have paid based on his 2021 income of $100,790. The Guideline amount is $953. That is a difference of $327 per month, or $3,924 per year.

- [88] From July 1, 2023 through to June 30, 2024, T.K. should have paid based on his 2022 income of $101,545. The Guideline amount is $960. That is a difference of $334 per month, or $4,008 per year.

[89] And lastly, from July 1, 2024 onwards, T.K. should be paying based on his 2023 income of $82,519. The Guideline amount is $789. He continues to pay $626 per month and therefore is behind $163 per month for two months, or $326, for July and August.

- [90] I calculate the sum of these differences to be $10,298.
- [91] With regard to the section 7 expenses, counsel for T.K. argues that dance, gymkhana, and the cost of the hotel stay following M.K.'s surgery do not qualify as special or extraordinary expenses. I disagree.
- [92] The definition of extraordinary expense in s. 7(1.1) of the Federal Child Support Guidelines includes those that the requesting spouse can reasonably cover, taking into account that party's income and the table amount that the parent would receive. Where s. 7(1.1) does not apply, or said differently, where the requesting parent can reasonably

afford the expense, the expense can still be considered extraordinary taking into consideration the nature of the activities, any special needs and talents of the child, the overall cost of the programs and activities, and any other similar factor the court considers relevant.

[93] Both parties have supported M.K. in dance, 4H, and more recently gymkhana. Both parties agree that M.K. should continue with dance and gymkhana provided she wants to.

[94] As such, both parties will contribute to both activities in proportion to their incomes. In addition, T.K. will reimburse E.C. for his proportionate share of M.K.'s dance expenses for the 2023/24 year ($620.25) and for his share of the $185 hotel fee. The total of both expenses is $805.25. His share is 64% or $515 .

[95] Adding $515 to the lump-sum arrears, T.K. owes a total of $10,813.

- [96] T.K. testified that he cannot afford a lump-sum payment, and that the most he can pay for child support and arrears combined is around $800 per month. However, within the last year T.K. benefitted financially from the sale of his [omitted for posting] property. The evidence is not clear whether he netted $74,356, or double that amount. He was reluctant to clarify whether he split the net proceeds with his father who was on title, or whether he retained all of the net proceeds. What he did admit is that the property was solely his, for all purposes, and that he used the net proceeds to pay down much of his debt. That said, and given his steady employment, he should be able to qualify for a loan or line of credit in order to pay off the arrears. I will leave it to him to sort out his finances, but he needs to pay the arrears in full by October 1, 2024.

[97] Lastly, E.C. asks that I impute income of $100,000 to T.K. for the years going forward given his history of non-compliance with his financial disclosure. She also asks that I pre-determine the amount he is to pay towards special expenses to $2,400 year ($200/month) on a go-forward basis. I am not going to make those orders.

[98] Instead, I will remind T.K. that this is the second time the court has ordered him to pay arrears. I hope by now that he is well aware of the consequences of failing to

provide financial disclosure in a timely manner. If he fails to produce his disclosure again by the deadlines that I am about to impose, E.C. will be at liberty to apply to the court for further financial penalties.

## ORDER

- [99] Until then, and given the considerations in ss. 37 and 38, and keeping in mind that my only consideration is the best interests of the child, my order is as follows:
1.  This Court is satisfied that E.C. and T.K. are the guardians of the child M.K. born [omitted for posting], under s 39(1) of the Family Law Act.
2.  Pursuant to s. 40(2) of the Family Law Act , E.C. and T.K. will share equally all parental responsibilities as set out in s. 41 of the Family Law Act .
3.  Parental responsibilities must be exercised as follows:
- a)  E.C. and T.K. will have the obligation to advise each other of any matters of a significant nature affecting the child;
- b)  E.C. and T.K. will have the obligation to discuss with each other any significant decisions that have to be made concerning the child, including significant decisions about the health (except emergency decisions), education, religious instruction, and general welfare;
- c)  E.C. and T.K. will have the obligation to discuss significant decisions with each other and the obligation to try to reach agreement on those decisions;
- d)  In the event that E.C. and T.K. cannot reach agreement on a significant decision despite their best efforts, the parent who has the primary residence of the child will be entitled to make those decisions and the non-resident parent will have the right to apply for directions on any decision considered to be contrary to the best interests of the child, under s. 49 of the Family Law Act; and
- e)  Each party may request and receive from third parties health, education, or other information respecting the child.
4.  M.K. will continue to reside primarily with E.C. until such time as the parties otherwise agree in writing or the court further orders.
5.  T.K. will have reasonable and generous parenting time to include:
- a)  Alternating weekends from Fridays at 6:00 p.m. until Sundays at 6:00 p.m., commencing September 6, 2024. I understand that this schedule will result in M.K. being in E.C.'s care for the majority of her gymkhana events for the upcoming season, and that two or so gymkhanas will fall on T.K.'s weekends. In the event M.K.'s gymkhana falls on T.K.'s parenting weekend, he has the option of choosing another weekend within the next

month if possible for his parenting time, and he will advise E.C. within seven days of receiving the gymkhana schedule of which alternate weekend he will have. Any change may result in T.K. having two weekends in a row, and that is fine. Having said this, I encourage T.K. to support M.K. not just financially, but emotionally with her events, and to be involved as much as possible. You do not need to be a horse person to do this. Your physical attendance, participation, and loud cheers will do more for M.K. than you know;

- b)  If T.K.'s weekend falls on a statutory holiday or non-instructional day, his parenting time will include an extra overnight and commence on the Thursday or end on the Monday, as the case may be;
- c)  Unless the parties otherwise agree in writing, T.K. will have M.K. each and every Father's Day, and E.C. will have M.K. in her care each and every Mother's Day, regardless of who is scheduled to have parenting time that weekend;
- d)  The parties will share parenting time equally over the school spring break and winter break, with the first portion beginning at 6:00 p.m. on the last day of school and ending at 6:00 p.m. on the day that is midway through the break, and the second part will begin at the midway point and continue until 6:00 p.m. the night before the first school day;
- e)  In even years, E.C. will have the first half of spring break and the first half of winter break, and T.K. will have the second half of the spring break and winter break. That arrangement will flip in odd years;
- f) In the months of July and August, T.K. will have parenting time with M.K. for two weeks, either consecutively or in two one-week increments. By May 31 of each year, T.K. will advise E.C. of the proposed dates for his summer parenting time. In even years, T.K.'s parenting time may include M.K.'s birthday;
- g)  Each party shall have reasonable and generous telephone and/or electronic communication with M.K. when she is in the care of the other parent;
- h)  Parenting exchanges will occur at the [omitted for posting], BC, Co-op, unless the parties otherwise agree in writing;
- i) The alternating weekend schedule will continue regardless of any additional holiday or intervening parenting time;
- j) By September 15, 2024, E.C. will update the online calendar to include the period up to August 31, 2025, and will add additional holiday days and activities during that time and beyond as they become known to her and she will share that calendar with T.K.; and
- k)  T.K. shall have such further and other parenting time as agreed to between the parties in writing. Both parents will give consideration to any reasonable requests that M.K. may have for additional parenting time

- provided that her requests do not impact where she primarily resides, and provided further that her requests do not interfere with her gymkhana participation, unless the parties otherwise agree in writing.
6.  Unless the parties otherwise agree, each parent is responsible for picking up and dropping off M.K. from her scheduled activities if and when they fall on their parenting time.
7.  E.C. shall not register M.K. in any new events or activities (beyond dance and gymkhana) without T.K.'s express written consent, unless: (1) they do not conflict with any of T.K.'s parenting time; and (2) E.C. does not require T.K. to contribute financially.
8.  Each party must forthwith provide the other with their current address and telephone number and shall provide to the other party any updates of their address and telephone number within seven days of any change.
9.  T.K. is found to be a resident of BC and his 2023 Guideline income is $82,519.
10.  E.C. is found to be a resident of BC and her 2023 Guideline income is $46,046.
11.  T.K. shall pay to E.C. the sum of $789 per month for the support of the child, commencing on September 1, 2024 and continuing on the 1 st  day of each and every month thereafter for as long as the child is eligible for support under the Family Law Act or until further court order.
12.  T.K. shall pay to E.C. his proportional share for the child's special or extraordinary expenses. The parties' respective proportional shares are T.K. 64%, and E.C. 46%. The following expenses will be special or extraordinary expenses:
- a)  gymkhana registration, entry fees, and insurance fees;
- b)  dance registration and costume expenses;
- c)  those expenses listed in s. 7 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines ; and
- d)  any other expenses that are agreed to in writing and in advance.
13.  The parent who incurs the expense shall provide the other parent with a copy of the receipt or proof of payment for any special or extraordinary expenses, and the other parent shall pay his/her proportional share of the expense to the paying parent within 14 days.
14.  The arrears of child support and special expenses payable by T.K. to E.C. are fixed as of August 31, 2024 in the amount of $10,813 inclusive of statutory interest, if any. T.K. shall pay the arrears owing to E.C., in full, on or before October 1, 2024.
15.  For as long as the child is eligible to receive child support, the parties shall exchange: (a) copies of their respective income tax returns for the previous year, including all attachments, not later than May 30 each year; and (b) copies of any Notice of Assessment or Reassessment provided to them by the Canada Revenue Agency, immediately upon receipt.

16.  Any changes to T.K.'s monthly child-support obligations and any adjustments to the parties' proportionate sharing of special expenses will take effect as of July 1 of each year, commencing 2025.
17.  Child support and the proportionate sharing of special expenses may be recalculated on an annual basis in accordance with section 155 of the Family Law Act , upon either party enrolling in the Child Support Recalculation Service operated by the Ministry of Attorney General.

## 18.  The parties shall:

- a)  put the best interests of the child before their own interests;
- b)  encourage the child to have a good relationship with the other parent and speak to the child about the other parent and that parent's partner in a positive and respectful manner; and
- c)  make a real effort to maintain polite, respectful communications with each other, refraining from any negative or hostile criticism, communication, or argument in front of the child.

## 19.  The parties shall not:

- a)  question the child about the other parent or time spent with the other parent beyond simple conversational questions;
- b)  discuss with the child any inappropriate adult, court, or legal matters; or
- c)  blame, criticize, or disparage the other parent to the child.
20.  The parties shall encourage their respective families to refrain from any negative comments about the other parent and his or her extended family, and from discussions in front of the child concerning family issues or litigation.
21.  Perhaps most significant, I am ordering counselling for M.K. Both parents need to understand that this is not a choice for M.K. As her parents, it will be your joint responsibility to coordinate this counselling and to get M.K. there. E.C., it may be that much of the responsibility falls on you as M.K. will be living with you. You will have to figure out how to make that counselling work around your schedule. Many counsellors conduct virtual sessions now, so that may be an option. If you have unreliable Wi-Fi at your residence, then it may need to be that the sessions occur in person. Personally, I think in-person will be best, at least for the first few sessions as it will allow M.K. to build a rapport with her counsellor. T.K. testified that his benefits plan covers counselling, and there may be some coverage through your benefits, E.C. Work with whatever benefits you both have available to you. What is most important is that M.K. has some professional supports to help her work through all of her emotions.
22.  By September 15, 2024, E.C. and T.K. will contact their respective plans and provide the other with a list of available counsellors in [omitted for posting], [omitted for posting], or elsewhere if they can agree. The parties will then use their best efforts to agree on a counsellor for M.K., and if they cannot reach agreement by September 30, 2024, then E.C. will make the selection and make

2024 BCPC 169 (CanLII)

the arrangements. The parties will then use their best efforts to have the child attend and participate in counselling as recommended by the counsellor. Any counselling fees not covered by either party's insurance are a special expense and the parties will share these expenses in proportion to their incomes.

23.  Finally, and pursuant to s. 224(1)(a) of the Family Law Act , the following steps must occur prior to any further court applications to vary parenting time:
- a)  T.K. and E.C. shall first participate in family dispute resolution with a family justice counsellor or agreed-upon mediator, any costs are to be shared equally; and
- b)  the parties shall obtain an updated Hear the Child Report and will share equally any costs.
- [100] T.K. and E.C., I know the last year has been tough on both of you, but I do hope that you can each recognize that it has been tougher on M.K. You both seem like very good people, and M.K. is very lucky to have two good parents who love her. What she does not have, and what she really needs, is two parents who can put their differences aside and work together.
- [101] I believe you both have the ability to do that. Best of luck.
