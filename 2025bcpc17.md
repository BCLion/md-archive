2025 BCPC 17 (CanLII)

- [1] K.B. and J.N. are the parents of eight-year-old S.J.N.B., born [omitted for posting] ("S.").

## I. Initial Litigation

- [2] The initial litigation between the parties began on April 6, 2017, when K.B. filed an Application To Obtain An Order requesting four orders:
- i. to be named a guardian of S.,
- ii. contact time with S.,
- iii. parenting time with S., and
- iv. an allocation of parenting responsibilities concerning S.
- [3] J.N. filed a Reply with Counterclaim , disagreeing with K.B.'s requests and seeking:
- i. child support,
- ii. a sharing of special and extraordinary expenses for S.,
- iii. spousal support, and
- iv. a Protection Order , with the following terms: K.B. not contact or communicate directly or indirectly with J.N. K.B. cannot attend to, enter, or be found within 100 meters of J.N.'s residence, place of employment, or J.N.'s parents' home.
- [4] The parties entered into a Consent Final Order on September 10, 2018, supposedly as a complete and final settlement of all issues between them.
- [5] Unfortunately, the disagreements between the parties did not cease, and there are now 147 documents in the court file. Both parents profess a love for S., and I do not doubt it is true. Regrettably, rather than working together collaboratively and in S.'s best interests, the parties' relationship is dysfunctional, and S. is paying the price. Instead of sitting down and talking, the parties litigate.

## II. Second Series of Litigation

- [6] On July 29, 2020, K.B. filed an Application Respecting Existing Orders or Agreements, and on August 14, 2020, J.N. filed a Reply with Counterclaim . On October 2, 2020, K.B. filed his Reply to Counter Claim . On October 14, 2020, J.N. filed an Amended Reply and Counterclaim .
- [7] On June 8, 2022, after an eight-day trial, Judge Guild rendered a decision and made a new Final Order: K.B. v. J.N. , unreported, Provincial Court of British Columbia, Vernon Court File F-7478, June 8, 2022.
- [8] In his decision, Judge Guild accepted the parties' submission that there had been a material change in circumstances since the making of the September 10, 2018, Consent Final Order, and he made the following Final Order:
1.  The court is satisfied that J.N. and K.B. are S.'s guardians under s. 39(3) of the Family Law Act .
2.  Pursuant to s. 40(2) of the Family Law Act , K.B. and J.N. will share equally all parenting responsibilities for S., as set out in s. 41 of the Family Law Act as follows:

- c. The guardians will have the obligation to discuss significant decisions with each other and the obligation to try to reach an agreement on those decisions;
- d.  In the event that the guardians cannot reach agreement on a significant decision despite their best efforts, J.N. will be entitled to make those decisions and K.B. will have the right to apply for directions on any decision considered to be contrary to the best interests of S., under s. 49 of the Family Law Act .
4. K.B. shall have liberal and generous parenting time at dates and times as agreed between the guardians and at times as specified in this order. J.N. shall have all other parenting time.
5. Commencing June 17, 2022, which will be Week 1, S. will have parenting time with K.B. on a four-week schedule as follows:

- b. Week 4, from Friday at 8:30 am to Saturday at 11:30 am.
6.  Each parent will also have two non-consecutive 1-week periods of parenting time during the summer of 2022. Each party shall advise the other of their requested 2022 summer parenting time by June 30 of 2022. If there is a conflict, K.B.'s work requirements will govern.
7. Labour Day will be with J.N. in 2022.

8. The four-week rotating schedule starting September 9, 2022, and for school years thereafter, will be:
- a. Weeks 1 and 3, from Fridays at 8:30 am to Mondays at 830am.

- c.  Week 4, from Friday at 8:30 am to Saturday at 11:30am.
9. If the day preceding or following the weekend is a school noninstructional day or a school administrative day, the parenting time with K.B., shall include that extra day. This does not include statutory holidays.
10. The regular parenting time schedule is suspended during statutory holidays, winter school holidays, spring school break, and summer holidays. Parenting time will be shared equally between the guardians during those holidays, excluding statutory holidays.
11. S.'s parenting time with K.B. during the winter school holidays starting in 2022 will be from the end of school until 1 pm on December 26. In 2023, the parenting time with K.B. will switch to the other half of the holiday period, from 1 pm on December 26 until 8:30 am on the first day of school. Winter holidays will alternate yearly following the same schedule.
12. The regular parenting time schedule will then continue at Week 3 on January 6, 2023.

16. Statutory holidays will be shared as follows:
- a. Labour Day will be with J.N.

- d. Family Day will alternate yearly, with S. having parenting time with J.N. in 2023.
17. Victoria Day will alternate yearly, the opposite of Family Day, so that the parent who does not have parenting time on Family Day in any year has parenting time on Victoria Day.
18. Each party shall advise the other of their requested summer parenting time by March 1, 2023, and March 1 of each year thereafter. If there is a conflict, J.N.'s preference will govern for the first conflict and K.B.'s preference will govern the second conflict. Conflicts will continue to be determined in an alternating manner.
19. K.B. will have parenting time on Fathers' Day, J.N. will have parenting time on Mothers' Day, and the parties parenting time on S.'s birthday will alternate yearly, with K.B. having parenting time in the morning until 2:00 pm in 2023, and in the afternoon starting at 2:00 pm in 2024.

The parties or their designate shall have exchanges in Enderby using the fastest route taking into account road conditions, to minimize travel time for S.; or alternatively in Armstrong, at K.B.'s discretion, provided he gives J.N. at least 24 hours' notice in writing. J.N. must reply and confirm receipt of that notice in writing, within 10 hours. The parties may also agree in writing to have exchanges take place elsewhere.
22. Pursuant to s. 225 of the Family Law Act , the parties shall communicate with each other only by email, and only regarding family law matters relating to S. Each parent must tell the other parent if there is a change to the email address to be used. Each parent will confirm receipt of the other parent's email within 10 hours. If no confirmation is provided, a communication may be sent by text message, and confirmation of receipt of the text message must be sent within 8 hours. The parties may communicate by telephone if there is an emergency involving or affecting S. The parties may also agree in writing to communicate in a different manner.

- b. encourage S. to have a good relationship with the other parent and speak to S. about the other parent and that parent's partner in a positive and respectful manner; and
- c.  make a real effort to be·polite and respectful when communicating with each other, and shall not argue, or say or do anything negative or hostile, if S. can see or hear them.

## 24. The parties shall not:

28. K.B. shall pay to J.N. the sum of $729 per month, commencing on January 1, 2021 and continuing on the first day of each and every month thereafter, until December 31, 2021.
29. K.B. shall pay to J.N. the sum of $754 per month, commencing on January 1, 2022 and continuing on the first day of each and every month thereafter, for as long as S. is eligible for support under the Family Law Act or until-further court order.
30. For as long as S. is eligible to receive child support, the parties shall exchange: (a) copies of their respective income tax returns for the previous year, including all attachments, not later than July 1 of each year; and (b) copies of any Notice of Assessment or Reassessment provided to them by the Canada Revenue Agency, immediately upon receipt.
31. Pursuant to s. 222 of the Family Law Act , upon exchange of their income tax returns and notices of assessment, the parties shall discuss any material change in circumstances which may warrant a

change in the amount or date of support payable. Any agreement to change the support payable will be set out in a consent order and filed with the court as set out in Rule 81. Any changes to support will commence as agreed between the parties.

## III. The Current Litigation

- [9] On February 15, 2024, K.B. filed two applications: an Application About a Family Law Matter (document 120) and an Amended Application About Priority Parenting Matter (document 124). K.B. argues that since June 8, 2022, when Judge Guild rendered his decision and Final Order:
- i. There has been a material change in S.'s circumstances, including evidence of a substantial nature that was unavailable during the hearing in front of Judge Guild.
- ii. His circumstances have changed - including a change in circumstances as provided by the Federal Child Support Guidelines , SOR/97-175 [ Guidelines ] - resulting in a change in the needs or circumstances of S.
- iii. There has been a change in J.N.'s circumstances, including evidence of a substantial nature that was unavailable during the hearing in front of Judge Guild.
- [10] In the Application About a Family Law Matter and the Amended Application About Priority Parenting Matter, K.B. seeks several different orders, including:
- i. a shift of S.'s principal residence from J.N. to himself,
- ii. a change to parenting responsibilities and parenting time, with generous parenting time for J.N. (with conditions), but the majority of parenting time to be with him,
- iii. an order that he be allowed to have S. vaccinated,
- iv. the elimination of or a decrease in the child support payable to J.N.,
- v. cancellation of all or some of the child support arrears that he owes to J.N., and
- vi. enforcement of clauses 2 and 3 of the Final Order dated June 8, 2022, which require J.N. to share equally with him all parenting responsibilities for S. and which set out the obligations of each parent towards the other parent. In the alternative, a change to clause 3(d), such that if the parties are unable to reach an agreement on a significant decision concerning S. despite their best

- interests, then he would be entitled to make the decision, and J.N. would have the right to apply for directions if she disagreed with the decision.
- [11] J.N. is opposed and submits that there has been no material change in circumstances; instead, she argues K.B. is merely unhappy with Judge Guild's Final Order of June 8, 2022, and is seeking a re-trial of the same issues decided by Judge Guild.

## IV. Change in Material Circumstances

- [12] In making his applications, K.B. relies upon s. 47 of the Family Law Act :
2. 47  On application, a court may change, suspend or terminate an order respecting parenting arrangements if satisfied that, since the making of the order, there has been a change in the needs or circumstances of the child, including because of a change in the circumstances of another person.
- [13] According to the leading case in Canada of Gordon v. Goertz , 1996 CanLII 191 (SCC), the parent applying for a change to a Final Order in family court must meet the threshold requirement of demonstrating a material change in the circumstances affecting the child and the application cannot be used as an appeal from the initial Final Order. Furthermore, the judge hearing the application must assume the correctness of the initial Final Order and consider only the change in circumstances since the Final Order was issued. As set out in Williamson v. Williamson , 2016 BCCA 87 (CanLII):
- [32] The first step in the analysis set out in Gordon v. Goertz is to 'determine whether there has been a material change in circumstances since the making of the prior order': Boychuck at para. 14. The Court in Gordon explained what is necessary to establish a material change in circumstances:
- [11]   The requirement of a material change in the situation of the child means that an application to vary custody cannot serve as an indirect route of appeal from the original custody order. The court cannot retry the case, substituting its discretion for that of the original judge; it must assume the correctness of the decision and consider only the change in circumstances since the order was issued...

- [12]   What suffices to establish a material change in the circumstances of the child? Change alone is not enough; the change must have altered the child's needs or the ability of the parents to meet those needs in a fundamental way …The question is whether the previous order might have been different had the circumstances now existing prevailed earlier…Moreover, the change should represent a distinct departure from what the court could reasonably have anticipated in making the previous order.

[Emphasis in original]

- [33] At para. 13, the Court summarized what the applicant must establish before proceeding on the merits of the application:
- [13]   It follows that before entering on the merits of an application to vary a custody order the judge must be satisfied of: (1) a change in the condition, means, needs or circumstances of the child and/or the ability of the parents to meet the needs of the child; (2) which materially affects the child; and (3) which was either not foreseen or could not have been reasonably contemplated by the judge who made the initial order.
- [34] Absent a material change in the needs or circumstances of the child, the inquiry can go no further. It is only after this threshold is met that the judge on the new application can embark on a fresh inquiry into the best interest of the children.
- [14] In the present case, the onus is on K.B. to prove a material change in circumstances since June 8, 2022. In light of the law as it now stands, even if I disagree with the conclusions reached by Judge Guild on June 8, 2022, I cannot substitute my views for his. For K.B. to succeed in his applications, he must meet the following threshold test on a balance of probabilities:
- i. there has been a change in the condition, means, needs or circumstances of S. or in the ability of J.N. or K.B. to meet S.'s needs, and
- ii. which materially affects S., and
- iii. which was either not foreseen or could not have been reasonably contemplated by Judge Guild when he made the June 8, 2022, Final Order.

- [15] If, and only if, the threshold test is met, can I embark on a fresh inquiry into S.'s best interests. In that case, the hearing will continue, and I will have to consider all the relevant circumstances relating to S.'s needs and the ability of the respective parents to satisfy them. Notably, if I do find that K.B. has shown a material change of circumstances, the inquiry will not focus on the interests and rights of K.B. or J.N. Moreover, as each case depends on its unique circumstances, the only issue would be S.'s best interests in the circumstances of this case.
- [16] K.B. has set out what he says are the material changes of circumstances:
1.  J.N. moved residences for a month after a disagreement with Mr. R.
2.  There is a pattern of S. missing a lot of classes at school, both when he was in kindergarten (2022/23) and grade 1 (2023/24).
3.  J.N. and Mr. R. misled Judge Guild concerning S.'s sleeping arrangements in that they testified that S. would have his own bedroom in a new three-bedroom house they were building. However, J.N. and Mr. R.'s new house is only a two-bedroom, and S. still has to share a bedroom with his younger half-sister.
4.  K.B.'s parenting time with S. is now over forty percent.
5.  S. is a friendly, intelligent, and intuitive young man who will be eight years of age on [omitted for publication]. S.'s opinions, as set out in the Views of the Child Report (exhibit 1), should be afforded deference, especially in respect of S.'s fear of Mr. R., fear of the wolf-dogs Mr. R. owns and keeps at the house, and S.'s desire to transition to residing primarily at K.B.'s house.

## V. Discussion

- [17] I have read and considered Judge Guild's Reasons for Judgment . The issues Judge Guild identified and dealt with include the following:
- i. J.N.'s unilateral and bad faith decision contrary to a court order to relocate from an apartment in Armstrong to a rural property about 15 minutes outside Falkland. J.N.'s new intimate partner, Mr. R., owned and occupied the rural property. It included a two-bedroom home, meaning that S. would share a bedroom with his soon-to-beborn half-sister.
- ii. How J.N.'s relocation impacted S.'s relationships with K.B. and S.'s paternal grandmother. Judge Guild considered the increased travel

- time from J.N.'s new residence to Sicamous, where K.B. resides, being 90 to 100 minutes, as opposed to the 50-minute commute from Armstrong to Sicamous.
- iii. The quality of S.'s life on the rural property, including the living arrangements and the presence of the wolf-dogs (along with other animals, including horses, chickens and rabbits).
- iv. S.'s views, which Judge Guild did not consider significant and which, due to S.'s young age, were not fully explored.
- v. The nature and strength of S.'s relationships with J.N. and K.B., as well as others in S.'s life.
- vi. The history of S.'s care and S.'s need for stability, including as S. matures, and an acknowledgement that as S. gets older, K.B. should have increased parenting time with S.
- vii. S.'s health and emotional wellbeing.
- viii. The ability of J.N. and K.B. to exercise their parenting responsibilities, including alleged family violence and their ability to communicate, get along with each other, and put S.'s interests before their own.
- ix. K.B. failed to provide a real plan or evidence about how he would care for S. if he had the majority of parenting time and the final say on parenting responsibilities.
- x. Child support.
- [18] In addition to K.B. and J.N., during the multi-day hearing the court heard from several witnesses who advocated for the parent who called them to testify, as is often the case in family law disputes.
- [19] Much of the evidence led by K.B. dealt with:
- i. S.'s enjoyment of and success at BMX (bicycle motocross) racing and how S. is one of the best riders in British Columbia for a child his age;
- ii. An altercation at the BMX park that changed the dynamics of S.'s relationship with his best friend D., as well as J.N.'s and K.B.'s relationships with various adults, including S.'s best friend's parents;
- iii. The Views of the Child Report prepared by Leon Grootendorst, Family Justice Counsellor, and other hearsay evidence that S. wants to live primarily at his father's residence in Sicamous;

- iv. How J.N. and Mr. R. misled Judge Guild regarding their plan to build a new house on the rural property where S. would have his own bedroom;
- v. S.'s fear of Mr. R. and Mr. R.'s wolf-dogs;
- vi. K.B.'s perception that S. has been sick far too often, resulting in S. missing significant amounts of school time while in J.N.'s care; and
- vii. K.B. now enjoys over forty percent of the parenting time with S.

[20] Not surprisingly, much of the evidence led by J.N. either refuted the evidence led by K.B. or reinforced that Judge Guild considered and dealt with the issue in his Reasons for Judgment , and nothing of significance has changed since June 8, 2022.

## Over Forty Percent of Parenting Time

[21] The strongest of K.B.'s arguments that a material change of circumstances has occurred is his submission that he now enjoys over forty percent of the parenting time with S. J.N. refutes K.B.'s argument that he now enjoys over forty percent of the parenting time with S. Still, in any event, she argues that Judge Guild dealt with the issue of K.B. having increased parenting time as S. aged and that even if the court now finds that K.B. currently enjoys over forty percent of the parenting time, his monthly child support obligation will not be reduced as J.N. is still unable to work. I agree. K.B. failed to prove on a balance of probabilities that his child support obligation, as ordered by Judge Guild, would be reduced or otherwise cancelled, even if he now has parenting time with S. over forty percent of the time. So, as argued by J.N., it is a moot point and not a material change of circumstances.

## S.'s Living Arrangements

[22] Concerning S.'s living arrangements with J.N. and Mr. R., I do not read Judge Guild's Reasons for Judgment to support K.B.'s argument that their failure to provide S. with his own bedroom or the presence of the wolf-dogs is a material change of circumstances. It is unclear to me what, if any, weight Judge Guild placed on J.N. and Mr. R. telling him of their plan to build a new house on the rural property so S. could have his own bedroom. I agree with J.N. that given the reality of building costs and

delays, there is nothing in Judge Guild's Reasons for Judgment to support an inference that the failure to build a house for S. to have his own bedroom by the start of 2025 would result in a material change of circumstance.

[23] Judge Guild was clearly unhappy with J.N.'s evidence regarding the living arrangements with Mr. R., but he nevertheless made the Final Order. Nothing has changed from the circumstances presented to Judge Guild between June 8, 2022, and today. I quote from paragraph 36 of the Reasons for Judgment :

[36] Although issues were raised with respect to Mr. R.'s wolf-dogs, I am satisfied they are not a concern. Mr. R.'s house is much smaller and S. no longer has his own room. He sleeps with his mother and sister. Mr. R. sleeps in the other bedroom. There are mice from time to time, but that is no different from many rural properties. S. gets to interact with two horses, chickens and rabbits, and one of the wolf-dogs. He has a younger sister he lives with. There is another family with young children who live relatively nearby and visit and play. There is a lake nearby. Falkland is the nearest town. J.N. said it was a small town with an elementary school and playground but no high school or hospital. Armstrong is larger and has far more amenities and services. Although there are some positive aspects to living at Mr. R.'s property, the location does not enhance S.'s life; it is just different.

## J.N.'s Alleged Move

[24] K.B. has alleged that J.N. and S. moved from Mr. R.'s residence to her mother's before Christmas of 2022 and that her move out of the residence is a material change in circumstances. He bases his position on what S. told him, specifically that J.N. moved several of her personal possessions, including heirloom china, from Mr. R.'s residence to her mother's residence, which indicates the move was a permanent relocation, not a temporary one.

[25] J.N. explained in her evidence that there was no move. Instead, she went with S. to stay with her mother from mid-December 2022 to mid-January 2023, an approximate four-week period. J.N. gave multiple reasons for the one-month stay at her mother's, which included:

- i. J.N. and Mr. R. had personal issues in their relationship and needed space.
- ii. She had planned to spend Christmas with S. at her mother's residence.
- iii. There were frozen pipes at Mr. R.'s residence, which, given the weather, made the house inhabitable.

[26] The explanation J.N. and Mr. R. provided to the Court makes sense and is internally consistent. Having heard all of the evidence, including that Mr. R. joined J.N., her mother, and S. for Christmas Dinner at her mother's residence, there is no reason for me to disbelieve her account.

[27] I accept that J.N. did not permanently move out of Mr. R.'s residence in December 2022. Accordingly, J.N.'s one-month relocation from the residence she shared with Mr. R. to her mother's residence is not a material change of circumstances.

## BMX

[28] BMX was not a thing in S.'s life when Judge Guild made the Final Order. It is new. I accept that BMX is important to S. and K.B. By all accounts, S. is very good at it. But is his participation in BMX, or the ongoing drama concerning adult relationships among the parents of the BMX riders, a material change of circumstances? I think not. BMX is simply a new activity that S. engages in. Hopefully, he will continue to enjoy participating in BMX and thrive. And just as importantly, hopefully, S.'s parents can find a way to mend fences so that S. and his friends, not the disagreements among parents and the friends of parents, become the focus of BMX.

[29] S.'s participation in BMX and the various issues arising from his involvement in BMX do not give rise to a material change of circumstances.

## S.'s View Of Where He Wants To Live

[30] As mentioned earlier, because of S.'s age, Judge Guild did not fully explore S.'s views as to which parent he wants to reside with primarily. In the Views of the Child Report , the author states on page 4, 'S. loves his father and is eager to live with him full time.' In his summary, also on page 4, the author declares:

- S. is eager to transition into his father's primary care. He and his father have a close bond and he is more comfortable being in his home. He is eager to be able to bike to school, have his own bedroom, and play freely outside. If S. is permitted to transition to his father's care, he would like to continue having parenting time with his mother and spend time with his sister.
- [31] With respect, the evidence provided by J.N. and her witnesses contradicts Mr. Grootendorst's conclusion. Nonetheless, Mr. Grootendorst's conclusion is consistent with K.B.'s evidence. So what do we do?
- [32] Although a developing area of the law in Canada, it is generally accepted that children have the right to express their views in all matters that affect them, especially in court or administrative proceedings as provided for in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , which Canada became a party to in 1991.
- [33] Courts may consider a child's opinion when making an order on parenting time and which parent the child will live with. The weight, if any, a court places on the child's opinion depends on the child's maturity and age. The Family Law Act does not have a defined age at which children can choose where to live and which parent they will spend their time with. Nevertheless, the opinion of a then seven-year-old rarely acts to sway the court one way or the other unless something is compelling in the young child's opinion.
- [34] In A.M.V. v. J.R.M. , 2020 BCPC 35, Judge Doulis, as she often does, provided guidance that is relevant to the present case:
- [151]   As Justice Butler noted in G.A.G.R. v. T.D.W. , 2013 BCSC 586 (CanLII), the concept of giving effect to the views of a child, where appropriate, is consistent with Article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , Can. T.S. 1992 No. 3 states:
1.   Parties shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her own views the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child.
2.   For this purpose, the child shall in particular be provided the opportunity to be heard in any judicial and administrative

proceedings affecting the child, either directly, or through a representative or an appropriate body, in a manner consistent with the procedural rules of national law.

[152]   Canada signed the Convention on May 28th, 1990. Although it has never been implemented, it was ratified on December 13th, 1991.

- [153]   Although the courts are encouraged to take account of the views of children, this does not mean that the children's views are determinative or even presumptively so. A child's view is not synonymous with a child's best interest. Still, the child's view provide 'context in which to understand better the whole of the evidence that must be weighed': M.H. v P.S.W , 2018 BCSC 1318 (CanLII), referencing Rupertus v. Rupertus , 2012 BCCA 426 (CanLII) at para. 13.

[154]   The question as to whether a child has reached an age and degree of maturity where it is appropriate to take his or her views on parenting time into account must be determined on all the evidence, with particular attention to the nature, strength and reasons for the child's views. It goes without saying, a court should consider whether a child's views have been unduly influenced by someone else.

- [35] In Silva v. da Silva , 2018 BCSC 788, a decision concerning whether an elevenyear and seven-month-old boy should have his views heard by the court on an application by a parent to relocate with the child outside of Canada, Justice Fleming noted in paragraph 59 that, 'the views of children as young as nine have prevailed, and that concerns about what underlies his stated reasons are properly considered in determining what weight those views should be given.'
- [36] Given the evidence that I have considered in this case, I am not satisfied that the court has sufficient evidence before it to make a realistic determination if:
- a. S. has the maturity to decide which parent he wants to primarily reside with,
- b. S. understands what a change in parenting arrangements would mean to his life, or
- c. what, if any, influences were brought to bear on S. when he told the author of the Views of the Child Report that he 'loves his father and is eager to live with him full time.'
- [37] Based upon the evidence before the court, including the Views of the Child Report , I cannot conclude that S.'s views as expressed by K.B. and the author of the

Views of the Child Report are genuinely his own and that he understands what a change in residence truly entails.

- [38] Accordingly, like Judge Guild, I am giving little weight to what K.B., J.N., their witnesses, and the Views of the Child Report have told the court about S.'s views on which parent he wishes to reside with primarily. Furthermore, even if I accept what K.B. and the author of the Views of the Child Report have stated as S.'s desire to live mainly with his father, I give little weight to S.'s views for the above mentioned reasons. The opinions said to me by K.B. and as set out in the Views of the Child Report are insufficient to represent, on their own or in combination with any of the other evidence before me, a material change of circumstances.

## S.'s Vaccination Status

- [39] The parties did not provide evidence to support any court action regarding S.'s vaccination status.

## S. Being Sick And Missing School

- [40] S.'s school attendance records were entered as exhibits. There was evidence presented explaining school absences, the school policy towards not having sick children attend class, and the various sicknesses suffered by S. during his kindergarten and grade one year.
- [41] On the whole of the evidence, there is no factual basis to conclude that S.'s missing school was for anything other than legitimate sicknesses. Furthermore, there is nothing in the evidence to support an inference that the home of J.N. and Mr. R. contributed to S.'s sicknesses or that J.N. was a 'bad mother' regarding S.'s health.

- [42] S.'s various illnesses, injuries, and absenteeism at school do not give rise to a material change in circumstances.

## VI. Decision

- [43] In L.M.P v. L.S. , 2011 SCC 64, the Supreme Court of Canada said:
- [33] The focus of the analysis is on the prior order and the circumstances in which it was made. Willick clarifies that a court ought not to consider the correctness of that order, nor is it to be departed from lightly (p. 687). The test is whether any given change "would likely have resulted in different terms" to the order. It is presumed that the judge who granted the initial order knew and applied the law, and that, accordingly, the prior support order met the objectives set out in s. 15.2(6). In this way, the Willick approach to variation applications requires appropriate deference to the terms of the prior order, whether or not that order incorporates an agreement.
- [44] Whether I would have come to the same conclusions as Judge Guild did on June 8, 2022, is irrelevant. In keeping with the principles established in Gordon , Williamson and L.M.P. , when determining K.B.'s applications, I considered what was known to J.N., K.B. and Judge Guild on June 8, 2022, when Judge Guild made the Final Order. I also considered the evidence presented to the court during the hearing of K.B.'s applications before me.
- [45] K.B.'s arguments are superficially compelling but, ultimately, cannot succeed. I respectfully believe that K.B.'s arguments were mainly dealt with by Judge Guild or do not meet the threshold test. In many respects, throughout the hearing, K.B. was expressing his dissatisfaction with Judge Guild's Reasons for Judgment . I agree with counsel for J.N. that K.B.'s applications, therefore, are primarily an attempt to relitigate matters previously considered and rejected by Judge Guild, contrary to the objectives of the material change test.
- [46] As S. ages and his interests in life expand or change, circumstances may arise that were not present before Judge Guild and myself, justifying a future application to change the June 8, 2022, Final Order. However, those circumstances were not present before me. K.B. has not established a material change in circumstances that would allow me to change, suspend or cancel Judge Guild's June 8, 2022, Final Order.

[47] Accordingly, I deny K.B.'s request to vary the Final Order of June 8, 2022, respecting parenting responsibilities and parenting time, where S. primarily resides, child support or s. 7 expenses, and cancellation of child support arrears. The Application About a Family Law Matter (document 120) and the Amended Application About Priority Parenting Matter (document 124) are dismissed.
