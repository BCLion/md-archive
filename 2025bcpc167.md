2025 BCPC 167 (CanLII)

## A.  Introduction

- [1] This decision follows a seven day trial, at the centre of which is five-year-old A.B.M.; the main questions addressed by this decision are:
2. (i) Where should A.B.M. live - Squamish, Ontario, or Kelowna?
3. (ii) With whom should A.B.M. live primarily?
4. (iii) How should parenting time and parenting responsibilities be apportioned?
5. (iv) What other orders should be made that are in A.B.M.'s best interests and permitted by law, if any?
- [2] The parties are A.B.M.'s parents. I.B is his father; A.M. is his mother.
- [3] The questions arise from:
8. (i) A.M.'s Application to relocate with A.B.M. from Squamish to Ontario, which she filed on March 14, 2024 (Doc. #121).
9. (ii) I.B.'s Reply to that Application, filed on April 23, 2024, opposing an Ontario relocation and seeking a final order for shared parenting, with exchanges on Friday afternoons and mid-week parenting for four hours on Wednesday for each parent (Doc. #124). (This relief approximates the terms of an order made by consent, without prejudice, on November 7, 2023).
10. (iii) I.B.'s Application About a Family Law Matter, filed on March 4, 2025, seeking primary residence of the child with I.B. until A.M. relocates to Squamish, with A.M.'s parenting time to be arranged (Doc. #148).
11. (iv) I.B.'s Application About Priority Parenting Matter, filed on March 7, 2025 seeking a return by A.M. of A.B.M. from Kelowna to the Sea to Sky Corridor, and full-time residency of the child with I.B. (Doc. #153); it alleges a breach of the Family Law Act , ( FLA ), wrongful removal by A.M. of A.B.M., and breach of a court order.
12. (v) A.M.'s Amended Reply/Counter-Application filed on April 11, 2025 (Doc. #172), opposing I.B.'s sought parenting arrangement and seeks an order permitting her to relocate A.B.M. to Kelowna (after the fact).

## B.  Procedural History and the Facts Related to the Trial Pleadings

- [4] In June 2024, the first two pleadings - Documents 121 and 124 - were set for a seven-day trial, to begin on April 7, 2025. At the time the pleadings were filed, both

parties and A.B.M. lived in Squamish. The parties were sharing parenting time under the November 7, 2023 Order.

- [5] In or about late June 2024, the Provincial child protection agency, the Ministry of Child and Family Development ('MCFD'), directed I.B. to keep A.B.M. - in breach of the shared parenting order. (I understand this direction to arise from concerns held by MCFD about A.B.M.'s safety when in A.M.'s care: see s. 13 of the Child, Family and Community Service Act, ('CFCSA' )). I.B. complied with the direction; he withheld A.B.M. from A.M., and A.B.M. had no parenting time with his mom for July and August, 2024.
- [6] A.M. moved from Squamish to Sechelt in September 2024.The evidence is unclear on the point, but it appears likely that she moved to Sechelt while A.B.M. was being withheld from her. At some point in September, she resumed her shared parenting. A.M. exercised her parenting time in Sechelt, not Squamish, despite not having sought a relocation order to do so. (By this time, the parties had been before the Court twice before, in relation to A.M.'s desire to move from Squamish with A.B.M.) In any event, it appears that the parties made the Sechelt situation work.
- [7] The 50/50 parenting time arrangement resumed for September and October.
- [8] On October 31, 2024, MCFD directed A.M. to withhold A.B.M. from I.B.'s care, due, apparently, to protection concerns - again, despite the 50/50 parenting time order. A.M. complied and I.B. has had virtually no parenting time with A.B.M. since.
- [9] In December 2024, A.M. moved with A.B.M. from Sechelt to Kelowna. This time, it is clear from I.B.'s position at this trial that, unlike the Sechelt move, this move did not work, in his view.
- [10] On February 27, 2025, Judge Hinkson found that A.M. was committing an ongoing breach of a court order made on November 30, 2021 every day that she resides in Kelowna and found that she was wrongfully denying I.B. parenting time with A.B.M. She did not return with the child, despite these findings.

- [11] After the court appearance on February 27, I.B. filed Documents #148 and #153.
- [12] It was only after these events, that A.M. filed her counter-application, seeking an order permitting her to relocate A.B.M. to Kelowna (Document #172).
- [13] Thus, by the first day of the trial that was set on Documents 121 and 124, the parties' and A.B.M.'s situations had all significantly changed and those pleadings had been complicated by those changes and by the latterly filed pleadings and I.B.'s Priority Parenting Application.
- [14] In order to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings, and to strive to provide some certainty for A.B.M., I directed that all of the pleadings mentioned above proceed to trial together.

## C.  The Trial Evidence

- [15] A.M. was represented by counsel at trial. A.M. testified and called five witnesses:
2. (i) N.V.R., a woman she spent time with while living at a Sechelt transition house;
3. (ii) K.B.M., a childhood friend from Thorold, Ontario, with whom she remains friends;
4. (iii) N.R., a friendly acquaintance from Squamish who sublet a basement room in I.B.'s former home;
5. (iv) G.P., a close friend of A.M.'s in Squamish for the past 15 years or so; and,
6. (v) K.B., a Squamish Social Worker assigned to I.B.'s file.
- [16] I.B. was self-represented. He testified and called four witnesses:
8. (i) N.M., his mother;
9. (ii) E.S., A.M.'s sister, who has lived in Squamish for a period slightly longer than A.M.'s 15 years or so;
10. (iii) A.A., a former neighbour of A.M.'s in Squamish; and
11. (iv) L.W., another former Squamish neighbour of A.M.'s.
- [17] I have considered all of the evidence led in this trial, even if I do not refer to it specifically in these reasons. I am aware that I can accept some, none, or all of a given

2025 BCPC 167 (CanLII)

witness's testimony. Further, I am alive to factors relating to the assessment of a witness' reliability and credibility. Counsel for A.M. reminds me of discussions relating to assessing credibility found in Xu v. Hu , 2015 BCSC 1400 and Sohi v. Sohi , 2015 BCSC 1043.

## D.  Relevant Law

- [18] Sections 37, 38 and 65 through 69 of the Family Law Act (' FLA' ), are raised by the pleadings. As a result of the trial evidence, I have also had regard to sections 183 to 185 of the FLA and section 13 of the CFCSA. All of these sections are set out in Appendix A to these reasons.
- [19] Counsel for A.M. relies on D.M. v. E.M. , 2014 BCSC 2091; D.T.S. v. S.P.M., 2022 BCSC 547; and R. v. Khelawon , 2006 SCC 57. I have considered these, as well as Barendregt v. Grebliunas , 2022 SCC 22, C.M.B. v. B.D.G., 2014 BCSC 780; and Havelette v. Morrison , 2024 BCSC 319.
- [20] I.B. did not provide any case law.

## E.  Brief Background

## i. Parties' Histories

- [21] While both of A.B.M.'s parents love him very much, their relationship was brief and they have no shared family history to draw on and very little knowledge of the other, and this reality likely impacts how they approach co-parenting. Their efforts to share parenting of their child have been marred by conflict and disagreements, which have undoubtedly been perceived and internalized by A.B.M.
- [22] By way of background, A.M. moved from Ontario to Squamish about 15 years ago, following her older sister, E.S. Initially, A.M. lived with E.S. and her brother-in-law briefly, and then found accommodation elsewhere in Squamish. A.M.'s evidence leaves the impression that she is resourceful and, in many ways, resilient. She testified that she obtained a bookkeeping and payroll assistant certificate, and she has obtained her

Early Childhood Education Assistant status. She testified that she is partway through a psychology degree, which she began in Ontario, before she headed west for Squamish.

- [23] A.M. testified that she purchased a small bachelor apartment in Squamish, which she has since sold. Stable housing in the Squamish area has been a recurring issue for A.M. since A.B.M.'s birth.
- [24] Turning to I.B., he moved to Squamish nine years ago. Originally from the United States, he testified to being drawn to the Sea-to-Sky Corridor for outdoor activities, ultimately settling in Squamish. He testified that he has learned from scratch the carpentry trade and has built up a carpentry business in Squamish. He said that he arrived in Squamish as an impoverished snowboard bum, getting by on rice. His employment and housing situation are both significantly more stable than A.M.'s.

[25] The parties met at a work site about six years ago and dated for about three months before A.M. became pregnant with A.B.M. They did not live together and there was discord over the pregnancy. When she was about seven months pregnant, A.M. travelled back to Ontario and lived in her parents' basement.

- [26] I.B. travelled to Ontario at least once, just after A.B.M. was born, and then returned to Squamish.
- [27] About seven months later, A.M. returned to Squamish with A.B.M., hoping that the parties' relationship would resume. It did not. This increased conflict between the two.
- [28] By June 2023, I.B. was romantically involved with another woman, L.L. At some point shortly thereafter, I.B. and L.L. began living together in Squamish. She became pregnant and they had a daughter in the early summer of 2024.
- [29] When I.B. was exercising his parenting time with A.B.M. from sometime in the summer of 2023 onward, under the 50/50 parenting schedule, A.B.M. was at I.B.'s and L.L.'s shared home. This stopped in late October 2024.
- [30] This is a good point to discuss MCFD's involvement in the parties' lives.

## ii.  MCFD's Involvement

- [31] In December 2020, when A.B.M. was less than 10 months old, MCFD removed him from A.M.'s care for a few weeks. The removal related to concerns about A.M.'s mental health.
- [32] Initially, A.B.M. was placed with a foster family.
- [33] On December 23, 2020, I.B. was appointed A.B.M.'s interim guardian to permit MCFD to place A.B.M. in I.B.'s care instead of foster care. The interim guardianship order expired on January 19, 2021.

[34] About two years later, according to A.M., when she was sleep deprived due to A.B.M. being ill, Squamish MCFD required that she attend Lion's Gate Hospital for an assessment in relation to her mental health. She testified, unchallenged, that she stayed less than 24 hours and was then released from hospital. Other evidence raises concern about the accuracy of this evidence: G.P. testified that he thought that A.M. was hospitalized for mental health concerns after she sold her condo, which is consistent with her experiencing significant issues a second time, after December 2020. N.M.'s evidence is also consistent with this. In any event, other reliable evidence shows that A.M. has had continuing mental health challenges which likely impact her interactions with A.B.M., I.B. and others.

- [35] A.M.'s former neighbour, A.A., testified that she contacted MCFD in November 2023, about her concerns of A.M. mistreating A.B.M.
- [36] As set out above, MCFD directed I.B. to stop the shared parenting time with A.M. in late June of 2024 (or so), and directed A.M. to stop the shared parenting time with I.B. in late October, 2024.

[37] I conclude from the evidence of social worker, K.B., and the testimony of I.B. and N.R. (discussed below), that I.B. and L.L.'s household was chaotic with volatile behaviour engaged in between L.L. and I.B., and between L.L. and her 11-year-old son.

I see no reliable evidence that establishes that outside of this dysfunctional household, I.B. poses any risk of family violence or neglect to A.B.M.

- [38] On November 19, 2024, I.B. consented to a Supervision Order under the CFCSA restricting his contact with L.L. and requiring his parenting of A.B.M. to be supervised. I.B. testified here that that order would expire on May 19, 2024 and that he would not be consenting to an extension or similar order because there is no risk of A.B.M.'s being exposed to family violence given his current living situation, given that he and L.L. no longer live together.
- [39] The social worker, K.B. testified that I.B. should not have been seeing L.L. under the November 19 th  Order, but intimated that the two may, in fact, have seen each other in breach of the Order and that this was of continued concern to MCFD. She expected that a new Supervision Order would be sought, on similar terms.
- [40] I.B. testified that in his view, the requirement that his parenting time with A.B.M. be supervised, in combination with A.M.'s moving the child to Kelowna, has created practical obstacles that have largely blocked his ability to exercise his parenting time, particularly given that he has to maintain his carpentry business to maintain the only financial stability in A.B.M.'s life.
- [41] K.B. testified that MCFD has a current file on A.M. in relation to A.B.M. in Kelowna.
- [42] Thus, MCFD is involved in A.B.M.'s life in relation to both parents. However; as discussed, the trial evidence satisfies me that any concerns about A.B.M.'s exposure to family violence in relation to I.B. are likely situational; that is not the case in relation to A.M.
- [43] With that backdrop, I now turn to the issues raised by the pleadings, starting with A.M.'s applications to relocate to either Ontario or Kelowna.

## F.  Issue 1: Should A.M.'s Application to Relocate with A.B.M. to Ontario be Granted?

- [44] Answering this question requires a consideration of subsections 65 to 69 of the FLA , as well as a consideration of whether the proposed relocation is likely in A.B.M.'s best interests, under ss. 37(2).

## i. Relevant FLA Relocation Sections and Findings

- [45] First, a move of A.B.M. to Ontario does amount to a 'relocation' within s. 65 of the FLA , as such a move '…can reasonably be expected to have a significant impact on his relationship with a guardian [I.B].'…
- [46] Given that there exist court orders respecting the parties' parenting arrangements, Part IV of the FLA applies (see: s. 65(2)(b)).
- [47] Section 66 requires that the relocating parent give the other guardian 60 days' notice of their intention to relocate. A.M. did that with regard to the proposed Ontario move.
- [48] Section 67 requires that the parties use best efforts to try to resolve any issues related to the proposed relocation. As discussed below, these parties are currently unable to resolve even minor issues between them about A.B.M.; there is no evidence of efforts consistent with s. 67 here. Rather, the evidence is consistent with a marked lack of cooperation: A.M. has continued the wrongful retention of the child even after a finding that that was so on February 27, 2025.
- [49] I.B. filed an application seeking to prohibit the Ontario relocation, as required under s. 68 if a guardian opposes the proposed relocation in the Part IV statutory scheme.
- [50] Subsection 69(4) establishes a presumption that a proposed relocation is in a child's best interests (on proof of certain factors - see: para. 53, below) where the guardians did not have 'substantially equal parenting time'. A.M. says that that is the

case here. I.B. says that the parties did, in fact, share 'substantially equal parenting time' and that, therefore, subsection 69(5) applies and no such presumption arises.

- [51] Under subsection 69(4), the onus is on the opposing guardian to establish that the relocation is not in the child's best interest; under subsection 69(5), the relocating guardian must establish that the proposed relocation is in the child's best interests.
- [52] In this case, it is unnecessary to decide whether the parties did or did not share 'substantially equal parenting time' because the evidence relevant to A.B.M.'s best interests so overwhelmingly demonstrates that the proposed relocation is not consistent with those interests that the subsection 69(4) burden of proof is met, in any event.
- [53] Further, the evidence does not establish that the Ontario relocation application was brought in good faith, as required by subsection 69(4)(a)(i), or that A.B.M. proposed workable or reasonable arrangements to preserve the relationship between A.B.M. and I.B., as required under subsection 69(4)(a)(ii). Both are required to be established by a relocating guardian, under subsections 69(4) and (5). I turn to both, below.

## ii. Good Faith - s. 69(4)(a)(i)

- [54] Subsection 69(6) provides a list of factors to consider in determining if a proposed relocation is brought in good faith:
2. (i) the reasons for the proposed relocation;
3. (ii) whether the proposed relocation is likely to enhance the general quality of life of the child and, if applicable, of the relocating guardian, including increasing emotional well-being or financial or educational opportunities;
4. (iii) whether s. 66 Notice was given; and
5. (iv) any restrictions on relocation contained in a written agreement or an order.

## Subsection 69(6)(a): The Reasons for the Proposed Relocation

- [55] In her March 2024 application, A.M. states that she would: (i) have a better support network in Ontario; (ii) the cost of living in Thorold, Ontario, is less than in BC; (iii) she is registered to complete school at Niagara College, to complete her Early

Childhood Education in September 2024, which would enable her to secure proper full time employment; and hence, a better standard of living; (iv) A.B.M. could start kindergarten at age four in Ontario.

## (a) Better Support in Ontario

- [56] The trial evidence does not establish that it is likely that A.M. would have a better support network in Ontario; certainly not one which is likely to be sustained such as to provide A.B.M. with a likelihood of stability and emotional safety.

## Supportive Friends

- [57] A.M. called only one witness with whom she is currently connected to in Ontario, K.B.M. Both A.M. and K.B.M. testified to their being friends since childhood and to remaining in contact, although they had not seen each other in five years or so.
- [58] K.B.M. testified that if A.M. and A.B.M. moved to Thorold, she could likely babysit A.B.M. now and then. She herself does not have children, but helps with her sister's children. She works full time and is married.
- [59] A.M. described K.B.M's family as being supportive of her in her youth, including when she began struggling with anxiety and depression. She did not provide evidence that she has remained in touch with the family since leaving Ontario a decade and a half ago, but I accept that they would likely be receptive to her return.
- [60] A.M. testified that she expected that she would be able to reconnect with old friends with whom she had not had contact for over 15 years. She did not know their social situations and, thus, availability for her and A.B.M. to establish meaningful connections: whether they had partners; children; worked full time, nearby or no; resided in the area.
- [61] I contrast this uncertain social situation with the strong friendship A.M. has with G.P. and the friendship, stability and continuity he affords her and A.B.M.; there is no one like that for her or her child, in Ontario, at least, not at this point.

## Family and Parental Support

[62] A.M. testified that while K.B.M.'s family was supportive of her in her youth, her own family was not. She testified that her father abused her physically until her midteens and, laterally, emotionally.

[63] Her evidence about her mother's support was inconsistent and confusing: she testified that her mother used to provide her a lot of emotional support. She said that her mother had offered to come live with A.M. while she was pregnant, or to have A.M. come and stay with them in Ontario. Ultimately, A.M. chose the latter and travelled to Ontario at about seven months pregnant; there, she lived in her parents' basement and after A.B.M.'s birth for about seven months.

[64] However, A.M. also testified that her family has disowned her as a result of having A.B.M. while not married. She testified that her mother sends I.B. gifts for A.B.M., not her. She said that her family constantly tells her to get help - for her mental health and for drugs use (which she denies) - and referred to some families as 'just toxic,' according to a book she read; I understood her to view her family as fitting into the 'toxic' category. She testified that most of her family is in Poland.

## Misleading the Court

[65] I find as a fact that while testifying about the positive aspects of her and A.B.M.'s moving to Ontario, M.A. misled the Court by creating the false impression that if she was allowed to relocate to Ontario, she and A.B.M. would have her parents' support, in that they could reside with her parents in Thorold, in her childhood home.

[66] This misleading arose from her own testimony and from the evidence she elicited from another witness, G.P.

[67] G.P. testified in direct examination that A.M. had talked about moving to the Sunshine Coast, to the Kootenays, and also that she had mentioned moving back with her parents in Ontario. He testified that he did not think that that would be an ideal

move. I asked him why he thought that and he clarified to the effect that he did not think it would be an ideal move for any adult, really.

[68] In redirect, A.M.'s counsel asked G.P. when A.M. last specifically mentioned to him her moving back in with her parents. G.P. replied within the last few months, tempering his evidence with the observation that it may have been just her way of expressing frustration.

[69] When A.M. testified, she said nothing to disabuse the Court of the impression clearly left by her witness that if she and A.B.M. moved to Ontario she had the option of availing them of her parents' support, at least in the form of safe and stable housing.

[70] Instead, she testified to the effect that her parents' home was proximate to a possible place of employment for her: A.M. testified that her parents lived across the street from an elementary school that has been converted into an early education facility of sorts. She said this in response to a question in direct examination about her employment plans. She had begun her answer with, 'Ideally, I want to go into child care/teaching.'

[71] Her testimony in this regard created the impression that: (i) her parents currently live across from the school, and (ii) the location of their residence could be relevant to her work situation, if she and A.B.M. moved to Ontario. This was an inaccurate impression.

[72] It was only when A.M.'s sister testified at I.B.'s behest that it became clear that, to A.M.'s knowledge, their parents had recently sold their home in Thorold and were moving in the next few weeks to a retirement community in a different town.

[73] Without the sister's evidence, A.M. would almost certainly have succeeded in leaving the Court with a false picture of what A.B.M.'s world could look like in Ontario if A.M.'s application to relocate there was granted: living in stable housing in the form of his maternal grandparents' home, with him and his mom having their support while she pursued stable employment across the street.

[74] It is difficult to conceive that this misleading was not intentional. It raises the concern that A.M. will lie to the Court to advance her position. I find that it erodes her general believability and when I consider the nature of the deception, in conjunction with the fact that the current relocation efforts are her third and fourth, and that she has in fact moved with the child in breach of a court order, I conclude that her desire to move with A.B.M. from Squamish is likely less about his interests and more about hers.

## (b) Ontario Cost of Living

[75] A.M. led no reliable, current evidence that the cost of living in Ontario is less than in Squamish. She testified that she thought she had last looked into Ontario rental costs in the summer before she moved out of Squamish, which is to say, a year ago. She provided no evidence such as rental ads or lease offerings for housing in the Niagara region, dated or otherwise. Her testimony about estimated costs are worthy of no weight; they were just unsubstantiated guesses.

[76] A.M. provided no evidence about costs of programming, utilities, food, gas, or any other staples that make up the basic cost of living which are required to be spent regardless of the locale.

## (c) Educational Opportunities therefore, Better Living

[77] Here, A.M.'s evidence was unclear and imprecise. Certainly, she led no evidence such as an admissions letter from an academic institute, or transcripts of grades or enrolment confirmation or acceptance in a programme consistent with improving her education with a view to securing better employment and obtaining a better living in Ontario.

[78] She testified that she was hopeful that she could apply for more jobs in Ontario and that if she cannot find work organically, perhaps she will be able to get work through a connection. She testified to the effect that K.B.M. has a large family and she had gotten work through them when she had lived in Ontario years ago. She provided no evidence of the current job market in the Niagara region.

[79] A.M.'s evidence made it clear that her plans are speculative and that she has no job offer in Ontario to go to, nor educational plan in place in the province such that I can conclude that it is likely that A.B.M.'s living circumstances will improve through A.M.'s probable betterment of her circumstances.

## (d) A.B.M. could start Kindergarten at the age of Four

[80] This is no longer relevant, as he is now five and can start kindergarten in BC this autumn.

## Subsection 69(6)(b): Whether Relocation to Ontario is likely to Enhance the General Quality of A.B.M.'s Life

[81] The evidence does not establish that relocating to Ontario is likely to enhance the general quality of A.B.M.'s life. There is no reliable evidence that A.M.'s employment situation would be improved or that her financial situation would be improved or that realistic opportunities for advancement exist there, which do not exist here.

[82] While A.M. testified that she thought that the resulting distance from I.B. would be good for A.B.M. because of the child's exposure to family violence when with his father, I reject this as a sound basis for the child's relocating with A.M. The evidence establishes that A.M. repeatedly dysregulates and engages in family violence directed at A.B.M. I agree with I.B. that it would not be a good thing for A.B.M. to be geographically isolated from I.B., who can, to some degree, monitor A.B.M.'s well-being while in his mom's care by interacting with A.B.M. frequently.

[83] Further, the Ontario relocation would remove A.B.M. from a community that he is familiar with, and away from people who have been in his life for as long as he can remember, including his father, G.P., his maternal aunt and cousins. I note, as well, here, I.B.'s unshaken evidence that he has received Facebook communications and other contact from community members, alerting him to concerns about A.B.M.'s wellbeing while in A.M.'s care. It appears that the Squamish community remains small enough that its members keep their eyes on the well-being of children. I note that while I.B. announced that he did not think he needed to call any witnesses at the

commencement of this trial, he was able to secure the last-minute attendance of two former neighbours of A.B.M.'s in Squamish who both testified about their concerning observations of A.M.'s treatment of A.B.M. when the child was in her care.

- [84] I am not satisfied that the evidence establishes that a move to Ontario would likely increase A.M.'s emotional well-being or financial or emotional opportunities.

## Subsection 69(c): Was Section 66 Notice Given?

- [85] It was. This militates in favour of the relocation.

## Subsection 69(d): Any Relocation Restrictions Set Out in an Agreement or Order

- [86] A.M. has complied with the terms of the November 2021 Order. This militates in favour of the relocation application

## Conclusion: Subsection 69(4)(a)(i): Ontario Relocation Application Made in Good Faith

- [87] As noted above, A.M. properly gave I.B. with notice of her intention to relocate with A.B.M. to Ontario and did not breach any order or agreement in the context of the application; these conclusions militate in favour of granting her relocation application.
- [88] However, the evidence satisfies me that A.M.'s reason for applying to relocate to Ontario is her general desire to get out of Squamish, for her own reasons, not for identifiable reasons that would likely improve A.B.M.'s life.
- [89] As mentioned, the Ontario relocation application is A.M.'s third effort to leave the Squamish area with A.B.M. The alternative Kelowna relocation application, her fourth. On November 2, 2021, I.B. filed an application for an order to prevent A.M. removing A.B.M. from Squamish, arising from her notice to him that she planned on doing so. That application resulted in the November 30, 2021 order which A.M. has been breaching since moving to Kelowna. Her first relocation application sought an order permitting her to move to Mission in June 2022; it was not successful.

- [90] As mentioned, her long-time friend, G.P. testified that she has spoken of moving to the Kootenays, to the Sunshine Coast, as well as Ontario. Neither Ontario nor Kelowna were the priority locations, based on G.P.'s description of A.M.'s musings about moving.
- [91] Having considered all of the evidence on the point, I do not find that the application to relocate to Ontario is brought in good faith, as required by subsection 69(4)(a)(i).

## Section 69(4)(a)(ii) - Have Reasonable Arrangements been Established?

- [92] If A.B.M. is permitted to relocate to Ontario, A.M.'s proposal is that I.B. have parenting time with the child for four consecutive weeks each summer, Spring Break, and half of Winter Break, along with other agreed-to time. She testified to being flexible and committed to ensuring video calls between I.B. and A.B.M.
- [93] Given that A.B.M. is five years old, an adult would have to accompany him on the six proposed annual flights. The attendant costs are obvious.
- [94] While A.M. testified to the effect that she would inevitably cover the transportation costs, I note that she has not had a regular job for more than three months in the last five years and testified about pursuing disability in relation to her mental health. I put little weight on that assertion and see the costs as a practical barrier to the plan being workable and reasonable.
- [95] Further, given the geographic distance between Squamish and Ontario, midweek and regular weekend parenting time for I.B. with A.B.M. would not be possible.
- [96] I find that the proposed arrangements will be unlikely to 'preserve' the current relationship that A.B.M. and I.B. have, based on years of near-daily contact.
- [97] I am not satisfied that A.M. has proposed reasonable and workable arrangements as required by ss. 69(4)(a)(ii).

## Impact of Subsection 69(4)(a)(i) and (ii) Findings

- [98] Given that A.M. has failed to satisfy the Court that the proposed relocation is either made in good faith or that she has proposed reasonable and workable arrangements, a consideration of whether the proposed relocation is in A.B.M.'s best interests is not necessary. However, given I.B.'s parenting arrangement applications before the Court, I do consider the child's best interests later in this decision. Given my findings there, I can say that even if A.M. had established the two preconditions set out in ss. 69(4)(a)(i) and (ii), and even if the parties did not have 'substantially equal parenting time,' the evidence satisfies me that the proposed relocation to Ontario would not be in A.B.M.'s best interests.
- [99] Having concluded that the Ontario relocation application was not brought in good faith, that A.M. proposed no reasonable workable arrangements and that the move would not be in A.B.M.'s best interest, A.M.'s application to relocate A.B.M. to Ontario, (Document #121), is dismissed.

## G. Issue 2: Should A.M.'s Application to Relocate with A.B.M. to Kelowna be Granted?

- [100] Before considering this application substantively, the question under subsections 69(4) and (5) again arises: Were the parties exercising 'substantially equal parenting time' when the relocation application was filed? (See: C.M.B. at para. 104). This relocation application was filed on April 11, 2025.
- [101] By then, A.M. was exercising exclusive parenting of A.B.M. in Kelowna, apparently at the direction (so far as the parenting time was concerned) of MCFD. The actual parenting arrangement was not close to 'substantially equal' at the time she filed. However, it was being exercised in breach of the November 30, 2021 Order and in breach of the November 7, 2023 shared parenting time order.
- [102] I find as a fact that A.M.'s unilateral move with A.B.M. to Kelowna has had the predictable result of removing almost all opportunity for I.B. to exercise any parenting time, given: (i) the supervision requirement and the practical limitations of securing an

available supervisor in windows of time available to I.B.; and (ii) the limitation of those windows of time, given his work schedule and the travel time from Squamish to Kelowna. As noted, Judge Hinkson has found a continuing breach and A.B.M.'s wrongful removal by A.M.

[103] I accept I.B.'s position that A.M.'s actions have had the practical and predictable effect of depriving him of almost all time with their child. Further, having considered the evidence of E.S. and N.M. and of I.B. about I.B.'s good parenting of A.B.M, I find that it is likely that I.B. would, in fact, parent A.B.M. safely and appropriately, when outside the chaos of his home with L.L.

[104] I have set this out in some detail, because it is impossible to know what the parenting arrangements would have been as of April 11, 2025, even with MCFD's involvement, had A.M. not left the Squamish area with A.B.M. months before.

[105] A.M.'s move to Kelowna with A.B.M. was made without s. 66 Notice to I.B.

- [106] As mentioned, court documents from 2021 make it clear that A.M. was fully aware of the requirement to give I.B. notice of her intention to relocate from Squamish with their child. In all of the circumstances, a concern arises that A.M. saw the MCFD withholding direction as an opportunity to finally do what she wanted without bothering with a court application, that is, to leave Squamish with A.B.M.

[107] Such a concern is consistent with the fact that A.M.'s move to Kelowna with A.B.M. is a flagrant breach of the November 30, 2021 Order made upon I.B.'s application for a non-removal order.

[108] A.M. cannot improve her position before the Court on this relocation application by breaching a court order and then relying on the circumstances created by that breach, to say that the subsection 69(4) presumption applies.

[109] MCFD's direction further complicates the situation.

- [110] However, as with the consideration of the Ontario relocation application, the evidence clearly establishes that the proposed relocation to Kelowna would not be in

- A.B.M.'s best interests. Further, it is apparent from the above that A.M. has failed to meet two of the four factors required under ss. 69(6) to establish that the proposed relocation is brought in good faith: she did not give notice and she is in breach of a court order restricting her relocation.
- [111] This leaves a consideration of the other two factors.

## Subsection 69(6)(a): The Reasons for the Proposed Relocation

- [112] A.M.'s counter-application (Document #172) identifies the protection of A.B.M. from I.B. as a significant factor for the application to relocate to Kelowna: the document refers to A.B.M.'s exposure to family violence while in I.B.'s care and to his instability.
- [113] In her evidence, A.M. testified that there is more support for her in Kelowna than in Squamish, including inexpensive drop-in childcare, driving support, opportunities to receive food and clothing donations unavailable in Squamish, and less expensive activities for A.B.M. She testified that there are more job opportunities there than in Sechelt. She noted that storage lockers there are $169/month, compared to $400 in Squamish. She testified that pre-builds are less. She is currently living in second stage housing, but noted that it is time-restricted.
- [114] Given my findings about A.M.'s credibility as well as my findings about I.B.'s dysregulation likely being situational, I do not put much weight on the child's protection from his father as a legitimate reason to remove A.B.M. from his proximity. I accept that the cost of living in Kelowna may be less than that in Squamish, currently; as well, that A.M. feels supported and optimistic about possibilities in this community she has lived in for a short time.

## Subsection 69(6)b): Whether it is likely to Enhance the General Quality of Life of the Child

- [115] The evidence does not establish that a move to Kelowna will likely enhance the general quality of life for A.B.M. While A.M. was hopeful about improved circumstances for her and A.B.M. in Kelowna, she provided no reliable evidence of job placements,

concrete educational opportunities, improved connection with important people to A.B.M. or her, or anything of the kind.

## Subsection 69(4)(a)(ii): Were Reasonable Arrangements Established?

- [116] A.M. proposes a 'reasonable' parenting schedule which permits A.B.M. to attend school in West Kelowna and divides recurring holidays.
- [117] Even without MCFD's supervision requirement, the proposed arrangement would seriously curtail I.B.'s parenting time: A.B.M. will be in school five days a week starting in September, which means that little if any mid-week parenting time could occur between I.B. and A.B.M., given I.B.'s work schedule and the lengthy drive from Squamish to Kelowna.
- [118] Weekend parenting time would involve drives of at least six hours, each way, based on A.M.'s testimony that the drive from Kelowna to Vancouver takes about four hours. While the parties could meet part way, A.B.M.'s reality would be that he would spend about 12 hours in a vehicle on the weekends he spends with his dad. That is not in this five year old's best interests.
- [119] Given the history of A.B.M.'s near-daily interaction with his dad, the inevitable reduction of parenting time by I.B., attendant on such a move, is not reasonable, workable or in A.B.M.'s best interests.

## Impact of Subsection 69(4)(a)(i) and (ii) Findings

- [120] A.M. has failed to satisfy the Court that the proposed relocation to Kelowna is made in good faith or that she has proposed reasonable and workable arrangements. For these reasons, her application to relocate there must fail.
- [121] Furthermore, as with the proposed Ontario relocation, the evidence shows that a relocation to Kelowna with his mom, away from his dad and the Squamish community, would not be in his best interests.

[122] Having concluded that the Kelowna relocation application was not brought in good faith, that A.M. proposed no reasonable workable arrangements, and that the move would not be in A.B.M.'s best interest, the counter-application in Document #172 is dismissed.

## H.  Issue 3: What Parenting Arrangements Should be Ordered?

## Section 37(2): FLA Best Interest Factors

- [123] Any order relating to parenting arrangements must be made in a child's best interests (see: s. 37(1)); thus, the discussion and findings about A.B.M.'s best interests is pivotal to a consideration of the remaining issues, arising from I.B.'s application for exclusive parenting time (see: Documents #148 and 153). This requires a consideration of the factors set out in ss. 37(2) of the FLA . I turn to those next, but first confirm that the findings discussed below also underpin my conclusions that the proposed relocations would not be in A.B.M.'s best interests, as stated above.

[124] The factors set out in ss. 37(2) are all relevant to the facts here, except for ss. 37(2)(b): A.B.M. is too young for it to be appropriate to consider his views. The discussion of the remaining s. 37(2) best interest factors follows, although not in the order set out in the FLA .

## Subsection 37(2)(d): History Of Care

- [125] For the first seven months of his life or so, A.B.M. was cared for by A.M., only, in Ontario. After her return to Squamish with the baby in September 2020 or so, I.B. has been involved in the child's care near daily, albeit not equally so until November 2023.
- [126] On January 19, 2021, a Consent Order was made granting I.B. contact time with A.B.M. from 4:00 pm to 7:00 pm, every day of the week.
- [127] In June 2021, a consent parenting time order was made, such that A.M. had primary residence of the child and I.B. had parenting time with A.B.M. as follows:

## Week 1: (48 hours)

| M, W, F: 4:00 - 7:00 pm        | 9 hours   |
|--------------------------------|-----------|
| Tues: 4:00 pm - Wed. 8:00 am   | 16 hours  |
| Thurs: 4:00 pm - Fri. 8:00 am  | 16 hours  |
| Sat.: 4:00 pm - 7: 00 pm       | 3 hours   |
| Sun.: 12:00 - 7:00 pm          | 7 hours   |
| Week 2: (44 hours)             |           |
| M, T, Th, Sat: 4:00 - 7 pm     | 12 hours  |
| Wed.: 4:00 pm - Thurs. 8:00 am | 16 hours  |
| Fri. 4:00 pm - Sat. 8:00 am    | 16 hours  |

## Sunday - none

[128] In opposing A.M.'s relocation here, I.B. testified that A.B.M. has pretty much seen his dad every of his life, up until late October 2024. As demonstrated by the terms of the June 2021 order, set out above, the court orders relating to parenting time are consistent with this testimony.

- [129] On November 30, 2021, an order was made increasing I.B.'s parenting time from that set out in the June 2021 order.
- [130] This arrangement, with minor adjustments, was in place until November 7, 2023, when the parties agreed to a 50/50 parenting arrangement, on a without prejudice basis.

[131] As set out above, the 50/50 parenting arrangement prevailed until interrupted in July and August, when I.B. had exclusive parenting time (without court order, at the behest of MCFD); in late October 2024, when A.M. began exercising exclusive

parenting time (also without court order and contrary to the terms of the November 2021 Order); and also apparently, at the direction of the MCFD.

[132] Thus, A.B.M.'s history of care includes primary care by A.M. for his first three and a half years, with near-daily care by I.B., although of lesser duration, until late 2023, when the division of care became equal: A.B.M. then was cared for by both of his parents for about eight months, until July 2024. Since then, he has had disruption and changing situations of a dramatic nature, so far as his care is concerned, as discussed above.

[133] I.B. has not travelled to Kelowna since A.M. moved there with A.B.M. He has seen A.B.M. twice during this trial. He described A.B.M. as being, in effect, joyful at spending time with him.

## Subsection 37(2)(a): Child's Health and Emotional Well-Being

[134] It appears that A.B.M. is a smart little boy with good cognitive abilities: G.P., N.R. and I.B. all described his interest in their tools or building materials and his aptitude at putting things together. G.P. described him as a 'smart kid' who can figure things out. G.P. explained that he does not have toys at his home but that he does have pipe fittings and he described A.B.M.'s making shapes with them and working with his hands.

[135] Both G.P. and I.B. described the little boy's interest in science related topics. I.B. attributes this interest to A.M.'s exposing the child to the topic. A.M. testified about A.B.M.'s interest in trains and history. N.M. testified that he learned to ride a bike at three and enjoyed reading nightly with his dad; that she has seen him engaging in healthy physical outdoor activities.

[136] However, the evidence leaves little doubt but that A.B.M.'s emotional well-being has been adversely impacted by the lack of stability in his life thus far, by the violence directed at him and to which he has been exposed, and by the discord between his parents. A.M. testified about concerning incidents related to A.B.M.'s repeated dysregulation and violent or anti-social outbursts.

[137] A.M. describes A.B.M as 'a thrower;' A.M. testified that she had had him in a music class but that he was asked not to attend because he was throwing sticks. She explained that while he did stop throwing sticks, the instructor decided not to keep him in the class.

[138] She testified that he hits her. She described him as high on the tantrum scale. During this trial, she referred to heightened day care costs for A.B.M. because two supervisors (not one) were required to ensure other children's safety due to his behavioural challenges.

[139] A.M. testified that A.B.M. entered into a play therapy program when they were in Sechelt. This program is described as a program supported by MCFD for children who have been exposed to violence. I conclude from this that adults interacting with A.B.M. have concluded (presumably based on their observations or anecdotal information) that his behaviour indicates that he would benefit from the program.

[140] A.M. testified that A.B.M. has been referred to a physiotherapist and an occupational therapist; she testified that goals here include helping him with emotional regulation, in order to help him understand hunger, versus anger.

[141] A.M. testified that A.B.M. was 'assessed' after they moved to Kelowna. She later testified that he was assessed by Child and Mental Health and was found to be high in 'one of the ADD or ADHD's,' as well as 'oppositional defiance' and 'anxiety'. She testified that he needs one-on-one care, and that an Individual Education Plan ('IEP') has not yet been done.

[142] I find it likely that A.B.M.'s physical health is adversely impacted by his emotional state in some ways: A.M. testified that A.B.M. would insist on drinking milk after returning to her care from his dad's at the age of four and half years. Asked for more detail, A.M. testified that he drinks the milk from a bottle and she said he sometimes poured it himself. Nothing in her demeanour or delivery suggested that she perceived that there was anything unusual about this.

- [143] I.B. testified that when he took A.B.M. to the dentist, the dentist observed that the child is being bottle fed. I understood this to suggest that the dentist could see evidence of the practice by examining A.B.M. and was concerned.
- [144] I.B. testified that he has noticed two behaviours that are new to A.B.M. since before A.M. moved to Sechelt with him: first, he says that A.B.M. is grinding teeth, which is making a clicking sound. Second, while I.B. testified that A.B.M. has always played with his hair, the little boy now has a bald spot on the back of his head. He stated that he saw A.B.M. twirling his hair and asked if he was pulling it and A.B.M. answered 'ya'. I.B. testified that both seemed to be related to the little boy being stressed or anxious.

## Conclusion re: A.B.M.'s Health and Emotional Well-Being

[145] I am satisfied on the evidence that A.B.M. is struggling, so far as his emotional well-being is concerned, and that this is manifesting in his dysregulation: his anti-social and violent outbursts, pulling his hair and his teeth grinding. Self-soothing by drinking milk from a baby bottle at the age of four-plus is not a healthy option.

- [146] All in all, A.B.M.'s health and emotional well-being are not as good as they would be, if his world were marked by more stability, calm and predictability and less chaos, discord and violence. He is not doing well as he could be. This takes me to a consideration of the factor in ss. 37(2)(e.).

## Subsection 37(2)(e): The Child's Need for Stability, Given His Age and Stage of Development

- [147] A.B.M. is five years old. He will be starting kindergarten this September, which presents an opportunity for him to experience structure, predictability and stability in his life, five days a week, from first thing in the morning until mid-afternoon.
- [148] As set out above, he has experienced a complete cut off from each of his parents, for months at a time, when used to seeing both of them near daily. I find as a fact that that is a destabilizing experience for a child of four years of age, or thereabouts.

- [149] As well, he has had to navigate two very different parental worlds, since infancy.
- [150] Added to that is A.M.'s physical moves which A.B.M. has experienced: initially, she lived with him in her condo in Squamish; then, in a large house; then to a transition house in Squamish for about eight months; then to Sechelt; and most latterly, to Kelowna. A.M. testified that she will have to vacate her current Kelowna apartment at some point in the near future and that she hopes to move somewhere else in Kelowna before the school year begins in September. That amounts to A.B.M.'s dislocation from three different communities and involves moves to six different homes, while living with mom, and involves little to no contact with his father for more than half a year.
- [151] A.B.M. has also experienced the introduction and then withdrawal of a second significant female figure in his life for over a year, in a family home setting with I.B. The little boy has experienced living in what was likely a chaotic home at times, but one that also introduced to him a step-brother and step-sister and, ultimately, a half-sister. Now, I.B. lives alone in a large home that he is renovating and testified is available to him for the next five years or so. When his parenting time resumes, that will be where A.B.M. will spend his time with his father.
- [152] I.B. testified about A.B.M.'s joy at finding his toys just where he left them, when he returned to his dad's home after being away for a week, when the parties shared parenting time.

## Conclusion re: Need for Stability

- [153] A hallmark of A.B.M.'s young life has been instability. Unsurprisingly, that is not serving his development well.
- [154] I find that in this case, this factor interweaves with subsection 37(2)(c), which I discuss next.

## Subsection 37(2)(c): Nature and Strength of Relationships

- [155] A.B.M.'s primary relationships are with his parents. I find, as well, that the relationships he has with G.P. as well as his maternal aunt, E.S. and her children (his

cousins), are positive, significant and important to his sense of stability and well-being. They all live in Squamish.

[156] I find that it is likely that A.B.M.'s relationship with his mother is one that is bonded and loving; however, as discussed below, I also find that it is not currently healthy. As discussed later in this decision, the trial evidence establishes that A.M. dysregulates emotionally in front of A.B.M., screams at him, is verbally abusive towards him and hits him. This is a complex primary relationship, the negative aspects of which must change for A.B.M.'s well-being.

[157] I find that it is likely that A.B.M.'s relationship with his father is one that is also bonded and loving. However, as discussed below, I am satisfied that A.B.M. has likely felt unsafe in his father's care, due to violent interactions between his father and L.L. It is likely that that sense of lack of safety renders that primary relationship complex, as well. It also must change for A.B.M.'s best interests to be served.

[158] G.P. is, according to A.M., A.B.M.'s male role model. G.P. presented as a thoughtful, kind, steady person. He and A.M. have been friends for about 15 years. A.B.M. has known him for almost all of his life. His thoughtfulness was exemplified by his testimony that after A.B.M. was born, he introduced himself to I.B. because he wanted I.B. to know who he was, given his proximity to his son. He testified that when A.M. vents about how hard her life is, he takes the time to listen to her concerns. If he and A.M. have a disagreement, he removes himself and gets on with his day.

[159] I.B., A.M.'s sister E.S. and M.N. all testified that A.B.M. enjoys playing with his cousins, who are just a bit older than him. G.P. testified that he has heard A.B.M. speak about his cousins.

[160] While it is extremely unfortunate that A.M. does not currently have a relationship with her sister and her sister's family, it is very good for A.B.M. that he does and that his dad facilitates the relationships.

[161] A.B.M. has no relationship with K.B.M., A.M.'s friend in Ontario and has no meaningful relationship with N.V.R., A.M.'s friendly acquaintance from Sechelt. A.M. testified about fledgling relationships in Kelowna.

## Conclusion re: Subsection 37(2)(c): Relationships

- [162] All of A.B.M.'s current significant relationships are with people in the Squamish area. Given the lack of stability that has marred his young life, so far, I am satisfied that maintaining as many of these relationships as possible is an important aspect of A.B.M.'s best interests: they provide familiarity of circumstance and correspondingly present situations where the little boy does not have to be emotionally vigilant.

## Subsection 37(2)(f): The Ability of Each Guardian to Exercise the Person's Responsibilities

- [163] I am satisfied that at times, A.M. is a loving parent and sometimes capable. She testified, unchallenged, about outings to Science World and up the Squamish gondola. She plans on taking A.B.M. to the Britannia Mine Museum and the Kettle Valley Railroad. She identified his particular interest in trains. She testified about enrolling him in activities such as Tai Kwon Do, music, and swimming, and her aspirations to snowboard with him, and the like. She has apparently worked with MCFD to address any exposure he has had to family violence and to address his behavioural issues. I.B. attributed A.B.M.'s interest in and knowledge of science topics to A.M.'s teachings and outings with their child. All of this illustrates that, at times, she demonstrates an ability to exercise her responsibilities towards A.B.M.
- [164] I have considered the role that living costs in the Squamish area have played in A.M.'s difficulties in navigating life since A.B.M. and she have lived there: whether challenges specific to the community have adversely and unfairly impacted on her capacity to parent him in a stable, positive, non-violent way.
- [165] Regrettably, I have concluded that that is unlikely. The evidence here establishes a distressing pattern of fractured relationships; a perception that others mistreat her and

are to blame; a history of bizarre behaviour including sending disturbing messages to people in the middle of the night; marijuana mis-use, and a history of mental illness.

[166] As well, I am satisfied that the evidence establishes that at times, A.M. may not be capable of caring for A.B.M. appropriately. I note her testimony about being initially overwhelmed when first navigating the serious challenges facing a new mother, who is unsupported; specifically, the state of her home then and MCFD's apparent concerns. This evidence is similar to L.W.'s evidence about entering A.M. and A.B.M.'s home to use the utilities, years later, and seeing the house often very dirty with rotting garbage and food items about; she also made reference of rat presence in the home. A.M.'s permitting A.B.M. to bottle feed is concerning, but A.M. appeared to have no insight that that was so, as she testified about this self-soothing practice, permitted by her.

[167] Turning to I.B., he acknowledged a single episode of suicidal ideation before separating from L.L. He described the stressors that he was then dealing with as including navigating a home that included L.L., their newborn daughter, L.L.'s challenging son, and her teenage daughter. He described financial stressors and conflict with L.L. He also testified about violent exchanges with L.L., which I discuss below. That said, he also said that his circumstances have changed and his mental health has returned, with a reduction of the stress.

[168] E.S. testified to I.B. being attentive and playful with A.B.M., as well as her kids. She said that I.B. ensured that A.B.M. ate well. That he was a 'very good parent to A.B.M. and a good uncle'. This is consistent with N.M.'s testimony, about her observations of I.B.'s parenting. While N.M. is I.B.'s mother and thus likely interested in the outcome of this trial, she was not challenged on her observations of I.B. caring for A.B.M. - sharing healthy outdoor skills and activities, reading to him and exhibiting appropriate parenting of the child, without dysregulation or conflict. I accept both of their evidence in relation to I.B.'s parenting abilities.

[169] According to I.B.'s unchallenged evidence, members of the Squamish community - including strangers on Facebook - contact him to ensure that A.B.M. is being adequately cared for while in A.M.'s care. This speaks to a community perception that

- I.B. is capable of parenting A.B.M. appropriately. The communal confidence in his being the parent to properly look after A.B.M. is consistent with my conclusion that he does, in fact, have the capacity to exercise his responsibilities in relation to the child.

Subsection 37(2)(i): The Appropriateness of an Arrangement that Would Require the Child's Guardians to Cooperate on Issues Affecting the Child, Including Whether Requiring Cooperation Would Increase any Risks to the Safety, Security or Well-Being of the Child or Other Family Members

- [170] The parties' efforts to cooperate on issues affecting A.B.M. have been marked by disagreement and conflict, which - while perhaps understandable from the perspective of each - has resulted in their both losing sight of A.B.M.'s best interests at times. A few examples are set out below.
- [171] I.B. testified, unchallenged, that he obtained a full time day care spot for A.B.M. in a licensed day care in Squamish, for which he paid three months in advance, so that both he and A.M. could work during the week.
- [172] A.M. testified that I.B. refused to tell her the name of the day care that their child was attending at the outset of the arrangement and that this concerned her.
- [173] I.B. agreed that he did not tell A.M. the day care name for the first week that A.B.M. went there. He testified that given his experiences with A.M., he predicted that she would adversely impact the arrangement and he wanted to have the benefit of the day care placement for at least his week, before A.M. got involved.
- [174] He testified that A.M. then posted an image of him along with a message on a Facebook page directed at Squamish mothers, 'My son has been abducted' - does anyone know where he's going to day care?' I.B. testified that he was bombarded by emails over the weekend by people who had seen the post; that he was contacted by the woman who ran the day care and she asked him not to bring A.B.M. back.
- [175] A.M. testified that A.B.M. '… didn't like it anyway….', referring to the failed day care placement.

[176] I.B. testified that at a second day care that he arranged for A.B.M., the child became unwelcome, as a result of A.M.'s interactions with the owner. He said that more recently, he contacted her again to see if she would re-consider taking A.B.M. and that she replied that she just did not want to get involved, so the answer was 'no'.

[177] A.M. testified that in her view, co-parenting with I.B. is difficult and that she feels like she is being forced or coerced. She points to I.B.'s stopping paying child support in July 2024 when he withheld their child and since she has kept the child, in breach of the November 7, 2021 Order, including while this trial has been under way: she produced evidence that she asked him to help pay for A.B.M.'s high day care expenses during the trial and he refused to, saying, in effect, that she had created the litigation and assumed for herself all parenting time by keeping the child and moving away, and that he did not understand that they were required to pay for child care on the other's parenting time.

[178] I.B. testified that he has had to fight for every moment with A.B.M., and had to fight for guardianship.

[179] A.M.'s unilateral move with the child to Kelowna, in breach of the FLA notice requirements and in breach of the court order binding her since November 2021 - taking him largely out of the reach of his father - is a stark example of her not cooperating in the parenting of A.B.M. I have not disregarded A.M.'s evidence of housing limitations and MCFD's involvement at the time that she moved with A.B.M. to Kelowna; I am simply not persuaded that the steps she took and the manner in which she took them were her only options. Rather, the evidence supports a concern that she simply took an opportunity to leave Squamish, as she had wanted to do for years, disregarding her obligation to cooperate with I.B. on the issue, in any way.

[180] Even with the February 27, 2025 Court Order reflecting that breach and ordering compensatory parenting time at 1.5 times, she has continued to disobey the November 2021 Order and retained the child in Kelowna.

- [181] All in all, the evidence shows that requiring joint cooperation between the parties would be counter to A.B.M.'s well-being, as it would almost certainly foster continued conflict between his parents.
- [182] This takes me to a consideration of A.B.M.'s experience of family violence, a factor which has seeped through the trial evidence and, no doubt based on the evidence, steeped his young life.
- [183] I pause here to note that in Barendregt , the Court confirms the significance that family violence will have in relocation cases (at para. 9).

Subsection 37(2)(g): The Impact Of Any Family Violence On The Child's Safety, Security or Well-Being, Whether The Family Violence Is Directed Toward The Child or Another Family Member

- [184] Section 1 of the Family Law Act defines family violence as including:
2. (a) physical abuse of a family member…;
3. (b) attempts to physically … abuse a family member;
4. (c) psychological or emotional abuse of a family member, including
5. (i) intimidation, harassment, coercion or threats, including threats respecting other persons, pets or property,
6. (d) in the case of a child, direct or indirect exposure to family violence.

## A.M.

- [185] The trial evidence establishes that A.M. has screamed at A.B.M. in a manner that leads me to conclude that she has emotionally abused him; as well, that she has engaged in physical violence directed at A.B.M. This evidence of family violence comes from two witnesses who resided in separate residences near A.M.'s home for many months, up to, likely, the spring of 2024.

[186] Given the significance of their evidence - because family violence is a serious thing and a significant factor in assessing a child's best interests - I have considered the evidence of both of these witnesses carefully.

[187] I note, first, that neither has an interest in the outcome of this case. While A.A. had some prior contact with I.B., they are virtual strangers. L.W. had never met I.B. prior to testifying at trial. Thus, I find no basis to conclude that they are 'on his side'. Nor do I see anything in the evidence that they have animosity toward A.M. In this assessment, I have considered A.M.'s testimony that at least A.A. was 'mean to her' at some point in time (discussed under s. 37(2)(h)).

[188] I note that their testimony is similar in nature about their hearing A.M. yelling at A.B.M. repeatedly, and to their each seeing repeated attendance of police cars at A.M.'s residence.

[189] I note further that both of these witnesses testified about receiving disturbing emails sent by A.M. to them. Other witnesses testified to similar communications from A.M., which I will discuss briefly here, and then return to the testimony of A.A. and L.W.

[190] N.M., I.B.'s mother, testified that she has met A.M. a couple of times, in passing. She said that she texted with A.M. when A.M. was first pregnant but then A.M.'s language became abusive about I.B. - that she was calling him names. N.M. described the texts as 'just horrible.' She testified that they caused her to be very concerned for A.M.'s well-being. She said she no longer communicates with her because it breaks her heart; that she does not want her to be vicious and mean; that she does not need the stress. Unchallenged, she testified that A.M. 'flipped her off' in one interaction. She said that she was happy that A.B.M. did not see it. She testified that A.M. threatened that she would never see A.B.M. again; that I.B. would not.

[191] I.B. testified to receiving 'miles of crazy hate mail' from A.M.

[192] E.S testified about receiving threatening voicemails from A.M. - 'that she should watch her back'. She said that she would receive 'novels and novels of hatred' from her

sister at 3:00 a.m. or 4:00 a.m. in the morning. She testified that she would block her and then A.M. would get a new phone number, and she would have to block that.

[193] G.P. testified to unhealthy rage texts sent by A.M.

[194] Thus, the evidence of A.A. and L.W. is consistent with the evidence of each other about their observations at A.M. and A.B.M.'s home, and is consistent with the evidence of other witnesses, albeit on topics other than their observations at A.M.'s home.

[195] Neither A.A. nor L.W. was shaken in cross-examination about their observations of A.M.'s conduct.

[196] I found them both credible and reliable witnesses and I found that their evidence establishes that A.M. has repeatedly and regularly screamed at A.B.M., including screaming words that would almost certainly cause him psychological and emotional harm. I find as well that she has engaged in physical abuse of the little boy by hitting him.

[197] A.A., the first such witness, testified that she lived across the street from A.M. and A.B.M., from 2020 to 2023, or perhaps 2024. Given that she recalled sending a text message to I.B. on March 19, 2024, that read: 'A.M. is next-level losing it'. I conclude that she likely remained A.M.'s neighbour until at least early spring 2024. She testified that she works with youth and was aware of 'protocols', which I understood to mean a duty to report child protection concerns to MCFD.

[198] She testified that although a hedge separated the two properties, and thus obstructed her view, she heard A.M. yelling pretty loudly; saying that she regretted having A.B.M. and that it was hard to be his mom: that she heard A.M. yelling that she should have had an abortion, like everyone told her to, and then heard a huge slap. It was then that called MCFD. She thinks that occurred on November 26, 2023. She testified that she also contacted I.B. out of concern regarding A.M.'s parenting of A.B.M.

[199] She testified that she had seen the police at A.M.'s home quite frequently.

[200] The second former neighbour is L.W. She testified that she lived on the same property as A.M. from October 2022 to March 2023.

[201] L.W. testified that she saw and heard A.M. screaming at A.B.M. at all hours of the day, including one morning around five o'clock, when she was awoken by A.M.'s screaming. She described it as unsettling.

[202] She described the nature of A.M.'s voice as more screaming than yelling. She said that sometimes A.M.'s tone was lovely and that other times, it bordered on terrifying. She testified that she called the police twice. She testified that at times what A.M. was saying did not make a lot of sense.

[203] She testified that she heard A.M. tell A.B.M.: 'You're such a liar, such a trickster, you're like your fucking dad; you're a fucking trickster…'. L.W. testified that it was as though A.M. was yelling at herself: 'Is that what you fucking want?' (I note that this language echoes I.B.'s testimony that he has heard A.M. tell A.B.M.: 'I'm sorry I'm waking you up, it's your stupid dad's time; I'm sorry I have to… but it's court ordered', or words to that effect).

[204] L.W. said that she observed the yelling roughly ten times. She would see A.B.M. arrive at the house, so knew that the child was there during the yelling.

## I.B.

[205] A.M. testified that I.B. was violent while she was pregnant with A.B.M. She testified that she recalled being pushed a lot when she was pregnant; that she would fly across the room; that she recalled him grabbing her neck; that he bruised her arm; that he threw her spirulina tablets and the bottle broke. She testified that she reported the bruised arm incident.

[206] She also testified that after A.B.M.'s birth, while he was an infant, I.B. came to her truck and began trying to bash in her windows; that she told him that A.B.M. was there and that he could be injured by the glass; that I.B. then began denting her truck and damaged it.

[207] She testified about I.B. assaulting her by a Royal Bank at a parenting time transition. She testified that it was 'just an odd time'. She testified that she learned not to be alone, because there were three people against her. She testified that she did not recall touching L.L.'s child; but that she did not think she hurt him. Her evidence here was difficult to follow.

[208] I.B.'s version of events was different: he testified that he has put his hands on A.M. three times. The first, he testified, involved her falling in the living room and his throwing a jar of tablets against the wall just before leaving. He said that it started with her being 'in [his] face;' that she grabbed his shirt and would not let go. He testified that he shoved her away and realizes that it is not something he should have done; he testified that such actions were not like him. He testified that she fell and his shirt ripped.

[209] The other two times, according to I.B., involved A.M. coming to his residence and refusing to leave. He testified that he eventually grabbed her by the arm and escorted her to the street.

[210] He denies her allegations related to bashing at the windows of her truck or denting it, all while A.B.M. was inside. Rather, he testified that A.M. arrived to his home 15 minutes early for an 8:00 a.m. pick-up and was yelling in the driveway 'You're keeping my son. You didn't even want him'.

[211] He testified that A.B.M. was outside with him, at first, but he then took him back into the house and told him to play in his room, so that he would not hear what A.M. was screaming. Ultimately, A.B.M. got into A.M.'s truck. I.B. testified that he hit the vehicle with his elbow and said 'Time to get out of here; time to leave'.

[212] He testified that two police officers attended during this scene and one spoke with him and one with A.M. It appears that A.B.M. was present throughout.

[213] Just what occurred between the two is difficult to assess, given their differing versions of events.

[214] I note that A.M. has misled the Court in other areas of her evidence. I note the evidence of other witnesses about A.M.'s dysregulation, consistent with I.B.'s descriptions of his interactions with A.M. here. Further, I note that I.B. has appeared to be generally forthright, describing himself as a snowboarder 'bum' and 'barely' having a high school education. I.B. has also admitted to verbal altercations between him and L.L., while denying these events described by A.M.

[215] Where their evidence differs, I prefer I.B.'s.

[216] What pivotally matters here, at this time, so far as A.B.M.'s best interests are concerned, is I.B.'s treatment of A.B.M., including his protecting the child from exposure to family violence. With this in mind, I turn to consider the evidence of N.R.

[217] N.R. testified that he lived in the basement suite of I.B.'s house as a sublet. He described the household above him as 'hectic', occupied for a time by I.B., L.L., L.L.'s 11 year old son and L.L.'s teenage daughter, the couple's newborn daughter, a dog, and A.B.M. during I.B.'s parenting time. He testified that when he moved out in December 2024, only L.L. lived there. This latter point is consistent with I.B.'s evidence that he and L.L. have separated.

[218] While I accept some of N.R.'s evidence, I find that his evidence should be approached with some caution: he had to leave his basement suite because I.B. - who was his landlord - said so, despite N.R.'s expectation that he would be able to stay; thus, a concern of animus toward I.B. arises. Further, unlike the testimony of N.M., E.S. and I.B., N.R. testified that he saw no positive interaction between I.B. and A.B.M. at all. This struck me as unlikely and unbalanced. Finally, as discussed later, there were internal inconsistencies in N.R.'s testimony about an incident involving I.B. and A.B.M.

[219] That said, I accept his testimony about the frequent verbal fights and discord between L.L. and I.B. and L.L. and her son. It is largely confirmed by I.B.'s testimony: N.R. testified about a lot of yelling and countless police visits to the household upstairs, and testified about L.L.'s son swearing and yelling at I.B. and L.L., and threatening to 'kill mom'.

[220] He testified that that both L.L. and I.B. yelled at each other and that he heard smashing doors. He testified that he saw L.L. throw a hammer at I.B.'s truck and that, somehow, he was aware that she wrecked I.B.'s motorcycle. He testified that her son dysregulated frequently and that when the adults were not arguing, it was her son 'against the world'.

[221] He did not testify that A.B.M. was present during the smashing doors; throwing of the hammer or wrecking of the motorcycle.

[222] He did; however, testify that he saw I.B. depart the home quickly in his truck and hit a neighbour's vehicle. In direct, he testified that he saw A.B.M. stand up in the backseat of the truck, obviously not seat-belted, and that he saw I.B. hit the truck and just drove away. In cross-examination, when asked how he saw A.B.M., given that the truck windows were blackened, he said that the back window was open and that A.B.M. was hanging out.

[223] I.B. denied that this happened.

[224] I note that I.B. was forthright about being arrested for criminal mischief in relation to breaking art in the home and agreed that he had expressed suicidal ideation to L.L. in the past.

[225] A child hanging out of a vehicle window is different in nature than a child standing up in the backseat. This is an area of N.R.'s evidence that I did not find believable, given the internal inconsistency about what he observed; given his negative interaction with I.B. about remaining as a tenant, and given his testimony of only seeing negative interactions between I.B. and A.B.M., in contrast to other witness's observations of the father and son's interactions, albeit in different settings.

[226] In all of the circumstances, I do not find that reliable evidence establishes that it is likely that the truck incident as described by N.R. occurred.

## Conclusion re: Subsection 37(2)(g)

[227] A.B.M.'s dysregulation and antisocial behaviour, along with the evidence of A.M.'s mistreatment of the child and the evidence of L.L. and I.B.'s frequent volatile interactions, satisfies me that A.B.M.'s safety, security and sense of well-being have likely been adversely impacted by family violence.

[228] While I am satisfied that the family violence directed at him would likely have the most deleterious effects, it is clear from the evidence that it is unlikely that he has had a reliably safe, calm place to lay his head since some time in 2023.

Subsection 37(2)(h): Whether The Actions Of A Person Responsible For Family Violence Indicate That The Person May Be Impaired In The Person's Ability To Care For The Child And Meet The Child's Needs

## A.M.

[229] I have found that A.M. is responsible for family violence directed at A.B.M. I am satisfied that the actions comprising this family violence, along with other of A.M.'s actions, indicate that her ability to care for him and to meet his needs may be impaired at times. These actions include A.M.'s dysregulation in the child's presence, as described above, as well as other actions consistent with unaddressed mental health issues, as well as her approach to interpersonal relationships with others which almost certainly leads to her - and his - instability.

[230] According to A.M.'s sister, E.S., in 2018 or so, A.M. began to hit herself in the face and scream, running around saying that she was suicidal. E.S. testified that she has seen A.M. hit herself in the head and that it would always come down to A.M.'s saying 'I will kill myself', or 'It's so-and-so's fault'. She testified that A.M. was violent in front of her children when they were small and that they are afraid of their aunt as a result. As a result of these actions, E.S. does not let her children interact with A.M.

[231] A registered nurse, E.S., testified that she observed that when A.M. smokes marijuana, she is more dysregulated and that her sister has no insight about the impact smoking marijuana has on her. She testified that A.M. smoked marijuana regularly in

2018 or so, and that she continued to do so while pregnant. At trial, A.M. testified that she uses marijuana regularly, without any apparent insight that it could be impacting her negatively in any way.

[232] I have regard to A.M.'s sending disturbing electronic messages to people in the middle of the night: her sister testified to receiving messages at 3 or 4 in the morning. A.A. testified about messages from A.M. in the 'wee small hours'. While it may be that these messages are sent when A.B.M. is with I.B., not his mother, the timing of the message indicates that A.M. is not sleeping in a normal, healthy pattern.

[233] A.M. has threatened harm, by electronic messages to numerous people: her sister ('watch your back'); to A.A., ('to the effect that she will harm her if she sees her around town and that she better watch'); and to N.M. ('that she and I.B. would not see A.B.M. again').

[234] A.M. frequently perceives people as being 'mean' to her; she used the word repeatedly in her evidence, until it was striking: she testified that I.B. was 'mean' to her; that two women who lived near her were 'mean to me', including witness L.W. She testified that L.L. was '…never kind to me', and said that L.L. made her 'weird care packages' that were offensive and began saying things about her that were not true. She testified that she does not like going to the Squamish Hospital because her sister works there and she does not know if people are mean to her because they know her sister, and know that she does not like her.

[235] I find that it is likely that her negative perception of others impacts her relationships with those who she perceives in this manner, and undermines her ability to build or maintain relationships.

[236] E.S. and I.B. testified to A.B.'s having fractured relationships in her own family, and in the Squamish community, as did A.M. herself. The evidence establishes a pattern of discord and instability: A.A. testified that A.M. was evicted from the property; A.M. blamed the Residential Tenancy Branch, saying the board sided with the homeowner and she was stuck in a transition house for eight months. A.M. testified

about losing a variety of jobs. She blamed others for MCFD's removal of A.B.M. from her care.

[237] She has testified about attending hospital to address her mental health issues, several times since A.B.M.'s birth, briefly.

[238] A.M. has not made securing sustained and significant help for her mental health a priority despite knowing that she has suffered from anxiety and depression since she was a child, according to her own testimony, and despite the chaos in her life. She currently views her family's pleas that she get help as indicating that they are treating her poorly. While she testified that she is currently on an Elizabeth Fry waitlist for counselling, it appears that she lacks insight into the impact her mental health issues are having on her and A.B.M. She made reference to seeing a psychiatrist and perhaps going on disability. She did not testify about a commitment to securing sustained support in addressing these issues. I find that her mental health issues have likely significantly contributed to A.B.M.'s experience of instability and violence with his mom.

## I.B.

[239] I have found that I.B. has likely permitted A.B.M. to be exposed to family violence between L.L. and him, and as well, between L.L. and her 11-year-old son. However, the trial evidence does not satisfy me that I.B.'s actions towards L.L., or any other actions, indicate that his capacity to care for A.B.M. and meet his needs, may be impaired.

[240] Turning to I.B.'s actions and a consideration of ss. 37(2)(h), it is likely that he is responsible for some family violence, so far as he and L.L. are concerned. While there is no direct evidence that A.B.M. was present during the couple's violent interactions, given the apparent frequency of those interactions and the 50/50 parenting schedule in place, it is likely that he was.

[241] The testimony of N.R. and I.B. establish that the I.B./L.L. household was chaotic and strained, and violence between the adults occurred there.

[242] I.B. testified that he and L.L. no longer live together. He remains in Squamish and she now lives in North Vancouver, presumably with their daughter and her other children. Just how that separation occurred is unclear on the trial evidence but given MCFD's involvement, I conclude that it is unlikely that I.B. took sufficient timely steps to remove A.B.M. from the volatile environment before A.B.M. was exposed to the family violence engaged in between the couple. I understand that this is why MCFD is involved with his and A.B.M.'s relationship.

- [243] The evidence about I.B.'s actions include his establishing a carpentry business; securing stable housing; getting A.B.M. to appointments on time; securing day care for the child; and maintaining relationships with people in the community successfully, including A.M.'s sister. All of this is good for A.B.M.
- [244] According to E.S., I.B. is very attentive and playful with A.B.M. and her children. She observed that they are not afraid of I.B., in contrast to their aunt. She descried I.B. as a very good parent and uncle, ensuring that A.B.M. ate well. She described him as stable, noting that he has always been self-employed as a carpenter since she has known him.
- [245] As stated, the evidence establishes that A.M.'s ability to care for A.B.M. or meet his needs is, at times, impaired.

## Conclusion re:  ss. 37(2)(h)

[246] It does not establish that such is the case with I.B.

## Section 38 - Assessing Family Violence

## (a) The Nature And Seriousness Of The Family Violence

- [247] I find as a fact that the family violence A.B.M. has been subjected to by A.M., includes physical assault, by means of a slap with sufficient force to make a loud noise that attracted attention of a neighbouring adult, and caused her to call protection services. As well, it includes dysregulation and screaming at A.B.M. words that are almost certainly emotionally and psychologically harmful to the little boy.

[248] While not the most grave of possible family violence, physical assault is always serious. The words that A.A. and L.W. heard A.B.M. screaming at A.B.M. included horribly negative messaging about both the child and his father.

[249] While there is no direct, reliable evidence that A.B.M. was present during the discord between I.B. and L.L., it appears that their altercations were sufficiently regular that, given the 50/50 parenting time arrangement in place, it is likely that he was.

[250] Based on both N.R. and I.B.'s testimony, I find it likely that A.B.M. was exposed to I.B. and L.L.'s yelling at one and other and disparaging each other. While I.B. agreed that he punched a wall in the house, and N.R. testified that he saw L.L. throw a hammer at I.B.'s truck, there is no evidence that A.B.M. was at the home at the time.

[251] Given that the yelling and destructive, violent behaviour was not directed at A.B.M., it is less serious than it would otherwise be. That said, there is little doubt that being exposed to it frequently lessened the child's sense of emotional well-being and safety.

## (b) The Recency of the Family Violence

[252] There is no direct evidence on this issue.

[253] However, given that A.M. has not addressed her mental health issues in a meaningful way, and given the frequency of her dysregulation according to A.A. and L.W., I find it likely that A.M. continues, at times, to dysregulate, in A.B.M.'s presence and that that dysregulation includes actions towards the child that cross over the line to family violence.

[254] I note K.B.'s testimony that there is an MCFD protection file open in Kelowna in relation to A.M. and A.B.M., as of the time of trial.

[255] The scant parenting time I.B. has had since October 31, 2024, has been supervised. Thus, it is unlikely that A.B.M. has been exposed to any family violence while in I.B.'s care over six months, on those facts. Given MCFD's direction to A.M. on

October 31, 2024, I conclude it likely that A.B.M. was last exposed to family violence while in I.B.'s care around then.

## (c) The Frequency of the Family Violence

[256] Having particular regard to the testimony of A.A. and L.W., and my conclusions about A.M.'s likely impaired capacity, it is probable that A.M.'s dysregulation and violent actions toward A.B.M. is a regular experience for the child.

[257] Having regard to E.S.'s evidence of A.M. repeatedly striking herself and the evidence of A.M. striking A.B.M. at least once, I find it likely that the slap heard by L.W. was not an isolated instance of physical violence by A.M.

[258] Given the evidence of I.B. and N.R., I find that the frequency of family violence in the form of yelling and shouting in the I.B./L.L household was frequent. However, as set out above, that has now ended.

- (d) Whether any Psychological or Emotional Abuse Constitutes, or is Evidence of, a Pattern of Coercive and Controlling Behaviour Directed at a Family Member
- [259] The evidence does not establish this.
- (e) Whether the Family Violence was Directed Toward the Child

[260] The family violence exacted by A.M. was directed toward A.B.M. The family violence to which he was exposed by I.B. was not.

- (f)  The Harm to A.B.M.'s Physical, Psychological and Emotional Safety, Security and Well-Being as a Result of the Family Violence

[261] In Barendregt, the Court observed that '[r]esearch indicates that children who are exposed to family violence are at risk of emotional and behavioural problems throughout their lives…' and that '[h]arm can result from direct or indirect exposure to domestic conflicts….' (at para. 143).

[262] The likely connection between A.B.M.'s current emotional and behavioural problems and his experience with violent moments in his young life is inescapable; it is likely that his behaviour reveals that his psychological and emotional safety and sense of well-being have been harmed.

## (g) Any Steps the Person Responsible for the Family Violence has Taken to Prevent Further Family Violence from Occurring

[263] There is no evidence of A.M.'s taking any significant, sustained steps to prevent further family violence from occurring, as discussed above.

[264] I.B. testified that he and L.L. have separated and that the conflict giving rise to family violence has ceased. N.R. testified that when he moved out of the house in December, 2024, I.B. no longer lived there.

[265] I.B. also testified that he was doing 'work' on himself; it was unclear whether or not that was in concert with MCFD or privately. His evidence about the future of his and L.L.'s relationship was unclear; however, I concluded from his overall testimony that he has insight into the harm that can be caused to children by their exposure to family violence and the role he must play in relation to A.B.M.

## Subsection 37(2)(j): Any Civil or Criminal Proceedings Relevant to the Child's Safety, Security or Well-Being

[266] MCFD has advised that they will seek an extension of the Supervision Order in the I.B./L.L. CFCSA file, such that I.B.'s parenting of A.B.M. will be required to be supervised.

[267] I.B. has advised that he will not consent to such an order and the matter will be set down for a contested hearing.

[268] As set out above, I do not find that A.B.M. has experienced family violence directed at him by I.B. Rather, I find that A.B.M. has likely been exposed to family violence directed at L.L., by I.B., and by L.L. at I.B., and likely by L.L.'s son toward her.

[269] I also have found that the trial evidence here does not support any concerns about I.B.'s parenting capacity so far as A.B.M. is concerned, absent his interacting with L.L.

[270] That said, I am mindful that MCFD may remove the child from I.B.'s care if that step is viewed as necessary for A.B.M.'s safety. This would amount to a further experience of instability in A.B.M.'s young life, in addition to the large change resulting from this decision and resulting order.

## Conclusion re: A.B.M.'s Best Interests, Parenting Time and Parenting Responsibilities

[271] Having considered all of the above, I am satisfied that A.B.M.'s needs for stability and calm and predictability are paramount. Further, it is clear that he must not be subjected to either parties' dysregulation, and certainly not screaming or hitting or any other form of family violence including emotionally abusive language.

[272] A.B.M.'s best interests will be served by him having stability and peace in his environment, and his sustained exposure to things, people and places that are familiar to him. This includes the community of Squamish - its geography, its parks, its playgrounds and its inhabitants, including his role model, G.P., his aunt and her children, as well as his father. Hopefully, at some point, it will also include his mother; certainly, at least, regularly for parenting time.

[273] His best interests will be served by a cessation of A.M.'s dysregulation and violent outbursts towards him. Also, by no further exposure to family violence of any kind.

[274] His best interests will be served by A.M. looking after herself, including her mental health, and her securing stability for herself stability.

[275] Beginning his school experience in a stable home environment, without conflictual interactions is consistent with A.B.M.'s well-being, as is his regular parenting time with A.M. when she feels good and is not dysregulated.

[276] According to K.B., Squamish has services to help A.B.M. with his behavioural and emotional or psychological challenges. He will benefit from engaging in these.

[277] In the result, I find that it is in A.B.M.'s best interests to have his primary residence with his father, I.B. I will make an interim parenting order in relation to A.M. until a reasonable adjustment period has passed: This case will be scheduled for a brief hearing to determine an appropriate schedule for her parenting time, once she has had an opportunity to digest this outcome and make decisions about her situation; a final order will then be made on that issue.

[278] Because peaceful and effective co-parenting is unlikely here, I.B. shall have exclusive parenting responsibilities for A.B.M. under ss. 41(a) - (l), except that A.M. shall also have parenting responsibilities under ss. 41(a) when exercising parenting time with A.B.M.

[279] Further, under ss. 41(i), A.B.M. is entitled to receive any notice that a parent or guardian is entitled or required by law to receive and I.B. shall ensure that he forward to A.B.M. any such notice that he receives in relation to their child, in a timely manner.

[280] A.M. is entitled, under s. 41(j) to request and receive from third parties health, education, or other information respecting the child.

[281] I.B. shall seek A.M.'s input on decisions about A.B.M.'s cultural, linguistic, religious and spiritual upbringing and heritage, through respectful email or text messages, and consider it in his exercise of parenting responsibilities for the child.

## I.  Issue 4: Should the Relief Sought by I.B. in Documents #148 or #153 be Granted?

[282] The evidence establishes that there have been material changes in A.B.M's needs and circumstances since the Consent Order setting out parenting arrangements was made on April 18, 2023: then, A.B.M. was just over three-years-old; he is now fiveyears-old and about to begin formal schooling. As set out above, stability concerns for the child exist now that were not present, or at least not apparent, in the spring of 2023.

Further, A.M.'s parenting limitations have become more evident, as discussed above, as has the parties' serious difficulties in cooperating, which has centred A.B.M. in the midst of conflict. (I have not had regard for the November 7, 2023 Order here, as it was made on a 'without prejudice' basis, but the same conclusions would apply).

[283] The relief sought in Document #153 is granted: Having been found to be in breach of the November 30, 2021 Order and to be wrongfully withholding the child, and upon making the findings set out above in relation to the child's best interests, A.M. must return the child to I.B. at 5:00 p.m. on Saturday, May 31, 2025 at the Squamish Save On Foods parking lot.

## [284] The relief sought in Document #148 is granted:

- (i) The child shall reside primarily with I.B.
- (ii) On an interim basis, A.M. shall have parenting time as set out below; a final order shall be made setting out her parenting time arrangements after a half day hearing to be set on June 3, 2025 or so soon thereafter as practicable, to permit A.M. to make submissions on the issue after having had time to arrange her affairs, given the terms of the final orders made herein.

[285] I now I turn to consider MCFD's apparent concerns about A.B.M.'s potential exposure to family violence while in I.B.'s care, if he and L.L. are in contact. The goal is to craft a situation in which A.B.M. has the stability and calm of a home occupied by him and I.B., while minimizing the risk that MCFD will remove him from that home due to historic concerns, or concerns which can be addressed through legislation other than the CFCSA.

## J.  Part 9 of the FLA

- [286] This leads me to Part 9 of the FLA : Protection From Family Violence.

[287] A.B.M. is a 'family member' of both I.B. and L.L. (see: s. 1 and s. 185 of the FLA) .

[288] On the evidence here, I conclude that I.B. and L.L. have likely engaged in family violence against each other, to which A.B.M. was likely exposed.

[289] On I.B. and K.B.'s evidence, MCFD viewed an order preventing I.B. and L.L.'s contact as a necessary step to protect A.B.M. On I.B.'s evidence, that order has expired but a new one will be sought under the CFCSA . Such an order has potential implications for I.B.'s parenting of A.B.M., as the November 19 Order required that I.B.'s parenting time be supervised. On the trial evidence here, I see no need for I.B.'s parenting of A.B.M. to be supervised, if he and L.L. are not together.

[290] That said, I do find that A.B.M. may be exposed to family violence between I.B. and L.L., if an order precluding their unrestricted contact is not in place, at least for the time being (see: s. 185 of the FLA ).

[291] While neither party here has sought a protection order, the FLA authorizes a judge to make such an order on their own motion, where appropriate (see: s. 183(i)(a)).

[292] Given the parenting arrangements order that I make herein, and having regard to my findings of I.B.'s parenting capacity, generally, and to A.B.M.'s need for stability, and his need for a non-violent, calm environment, a protection order will be made under s. 183 aimed at ensuring that A.B.M. is not exposed to any indirect family violence arising from contact between I.B. and L.L.

[293] As stated: Absent such contact, it is my considered view that there is no need established on the evidence for I.B.'s parenting time of A.B.M. to be supervised.

[294] It is my hope that the terms of the protection order herein satisfy MCFD of any protection concerns for A.B.M. while in I.B.'s care such that the child remains in his care without the need for impracticable full-time supervision. A.B.M. would greatly benefit from a stable arrangement such as that. However, of course, MCFD has a clear mandate and how steps are taken under the CFCSA in relation to this family is not in issue in this case; it is simply that there is currently significant interplay between MCFD's oversight and the Court's here, and this interplay has the potential to directly and significantly impact A.B.M.

[295] I expect that I.B. will understand how integrally important it is to A.B.M.'s stability and well-being that I.B. comply with the terms of the Protection Order such that he places his son's well-being before any wish he might have for contact with L.L., in breach of the order.

[296] Turning to a consideration of A.M.'s actions toward A.B.M., I am also satisfied that absent a Protection Order in relation to her, A.B.M. may experience family violence; (see: s. 185 of the FLA ). As a result of this finding, upon my own motion under s. 183(i)(a) of the FLA , I make a Protection Order in relation to A.M., as well.

[297] Both Protection Orders will be for a period of six months. The terms of each are set out below.

[298] I note for the benefit of the parties, that a breach of a Protection Order, may amount to a criminal offence under s. 127 of the Criminal Code .

[299] Further, so far as the Protection Order in relation to I.B., a breach will almost certainly risk A.B.M.'s removal from I.B.'s care, independent of other steps MCFD takes under the CFCSA , if any.

## K.  Conclusion

## [300] In conclusion:

- i. A.M.'s application to relocate to Ontario with A.B.M. (Doc. #121) is dismissed.
- ii. A.M.'s counter-application to relocate to Kelowna with A.B.M. (Doc. #172) is dismissed.
- iii. I.B.'s Application for an order for 50/50 parenting time set out in his Reply (Doc. #124) is dismissed.
- iv. I.B.'s Application About a Priority Parenting Matter (Doc. # 153) is granted: A.B. must return A.B.M. to I.B. in Squamish, on the terms set out below.
- v. I.B.'s Application (Doc. #148) is granted.The result of the above is that A.B.M. will live primarily with I.B. under the terms of the order, set out below.
- vi. On the Court's motion a six month Protection Order is made under s. 183(i)(a) in relation to both parties.

## FAMILY LAW ACT

## Division 1 - Best Interests of Child

- 37 (1) In making an agreement or order under this Part respecting guardianship, parenting arrangements or contact with a child, the parties and the court must consider the best interests of the child only.
- (2) To determine what is in the best interests of a child, all of the child's needs and circumstances must be considered, including the following:
- (a) the child's health and emotional well-being;
- (b) the child's views, unless it would be inappropriate to consider them;
- (c) the nature and strength of the relationships between the child and significant persons in the child's life;
- (d) the history of the child's care;
- (e) the child's need for stability, given the child's age and stage of development;
- (f) the ability of each person who is a guardian or seeks guardianship of the child, or who has or seeks parental responsibilities, parenting time or contact with the child, to exercise the person's responsibilities;
- (g) the impact of any family violence on the child's safety, security or wellbeing, whether the family violence is directed toward the child or another family member;
- (h) whether the actions of a person responsible for family violence indicate that the person may be impaired in the person's ability to care for the child and meet the child's needs;
- (i) the appropriateness of an arrangement that would require the child's guardians to cooperate on issues affecting the child, including whether requiring cooperation would increase any risks to the safety, security or well-being of the child or other family members;
- (j) any civil or criminal proceeding relevant to the child's safety, security or well-being.
- (3) An agreement or order is not in the best interests of a child unless it protects, to the greatest extent possible, the child's physical, psychological and emotional safety, security and well-being.
- (4) In making an order under this Part, a court may consider a person's conduct only if it substantially affects a factor set out in subsection (2), and only to the extent that it affects that factor.

## Assessing family violence

- 38 For the purposes of section 37 (2) (g) and (h) [best interests of child] , a court must consider all of the following:
- (a) the nature and seriousness of the family violence;
- (b) how recently the family violence occurred;
- (c) the frequency of the family violence;
- (d) whether any psychological or emotional abuse constitutes, or is evidence of, a pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour directed at a family member;
- (e) whether the family violence was directed toward the child;
- (f) whether the child was exposed to family violence that was not directed toward the child;
- (g) the harm to the child's physical, psychological and emotional safety, security and well-being as a result of the family violence;
- (h) any steps the person responsible for the family violence has taken to prevent further family violence from occurring;
- (i) any other relevant matter.

## Division 6 - Relocation

## Definition and application

- 65 (1) In this Division, "relocation" means a change in the location of the residence of a child or child's guardian that can reasonably be expected to have a significant impact on the child's relationship with
- (a) a guardian, or
- (b) one or more other persons having a significant role in the child's life.
- (2) This Division applies if
- (a) a child's guardian plans to relocate themselves or the child, or both, and
- (b) a written agreement or an order respecting parenting arrangements or contact with the child applies to the child.

## Notice of relocation

- 66 (1) Subject to subsection (2), a child's guardian who plans to relocate themselves or a child, or both, must give to all other guardians and persons having contact with the child at least 60 days' written notice of
- (a) the date of the relocation, and
- (b) the name of the proposed location.
- (2) The court may grant an exemption from all or part of the requirement to give notice under subsection (1) if satisfied that
- (a)notice cannot be given without incurring a risk of family violence by another guardian or a person having contact with the child, or (b)there is no ongoing relationship between the child and the other guardian or the person having contact with the child.

- (3) An application for an exemption under subsection (2) may be made in the absence of any other party.

## Resolving issues arising from relocation

- 67 (1) If notice is required under section 66 [notice of relocation] , after the notice is given and before the date of the relocation, the child's guardians and the persons having contact with the child must use their best efforts to cooperate with one another for the purpose of resolving any issues relating to the proposed relocation.
- (2) Nothing in subsection (1) prevents
- (a) a guardian from making an application under section 69 [orders respecting relocation] , or
- (b) a person having contact with the child from making an application under section 59 [orders respecting contact] or 60 [changing, suspending or terminating orders respecting contact] , as applicable, for the purpose of maintaining the relationship between the child and a person having contact with the child if relocation occurs.

## Child may be relocated unless guardian objects

- 68 If a child's guardian gives notice under section 66 [notice of relocation] that the guardian plans to relocate the child, the relocation may occur on or after the date set out in the notice unless another guardian of the child, within 30 days after receiving the notice, files an application for an order to prohibit the relocation.

## Orders respecting relocation

- 69 (1) In this section, "relocating guardian" means a guardian who plans to relocate a child.
- (2) On application by a guardian, a court may make an order permitting or prohibiting the relocation of a child by the relocating guardian.

(i)the proposed relocation is made in good faith, and (ii)the relocating guardian has proposed reasonable and workable arrangements to preserve the relationship between the child and the child's other guardians, persons who are entitled to contact with the child, and other persons who have a significant role in the child's life, and

- (b) on the court being satisfied of the factors referred to in paragraph (a), the relocation must be considered to be in the best interests of the child unless another guardian satisfies the court otherwise.

- (5) If an application is made under this section and the relocating guardian and another guardian have substantially equal parenting time with the child, the relocating guardian must satisfy the court
2. (a) of the factors described in subsection (4) (a), and
3. (b) that the relocation is in the best interests of the child.

(6)For the purposes of determining if the proposed relocation is made in good faith, the court must consider all relevant factors, including the following:

- (a) the reasons for the proposed relocation;
- (b) whether the proposed relocation is likely to enhance the general quality of life of the child and, if applicable, of the relocating guardian, including increasing emotional well-being or financial or educational opportunities;
- (c) whether notice was given under section 66 [notice of relocation] ;
- (d) any restrictions on relocation contained in a written agreement or an order.
- (7) In determining whether to make an order under this section, the court must not consider whether a guardian would still relocate if the child's relocation were not permitted.

## Part 9 - Protection from Family Violence

## Orders respecting protection

- (a) may be made on application by a family member claiming to be an atrisk family member, by a person on behalf of an at-risk family member, or on the court's own initiative, and
- (b) need not be made in conjunction with any other proceeding or claim for relief under this Act.

- (iii) following the at-risk family member,

- (iv) possessing a weapon, a firearm or a specified object, or

- (5) If an order is made under this section at the same time as another order is made under this Act, including an order made under Division 5 [Orders Respecting Conduct] of Part 10, the orders must not be recorded in the same document.

## Whether to make protection order

- 184 (1) In determining whether to make an order under this Part, the court must consider at least the following risk factors:
- (a) any history of family violence by the family member against whom the order is to be made;
- (b) whether any family violence is repetitive or escalating;
- (c) whether any psychological or emotional abuse constitutes, or is evidence of, a pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour directed at the at-risk family member;
- (d) the current status of the relationship between the family member against whom the order is to be made and the at-risk family member, including any recent separation or intention to separate;
- (e) any circumstance of the family member against whom the order is to be made that may increase the risk of family violence by that family member, including substance abuse, employment or financial problems,

- mental health problems associated with a risk of violence, access to weapons, or a history of violence;
- (f) the at-risk family member's perception of risks to the at-risk family member's own safety and security;
- (g) any circumstance that may increase the at-risk family member's vulnerability, including pregnancy, age, family circumstances, health or economic dependence.
- (2) If family members are seeking orders under this Part against each other, the court must consider whether the order should be made against one person only, taking into account
- (a) the history of, and potential for, family violence,
- (b) the extent of any injuries or harm suffered, and
- (c) the respective vulnerability of the applicants.
- (3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the person who initiates a particular incident of family violence is not necessarily the person against whom an order should be made.
