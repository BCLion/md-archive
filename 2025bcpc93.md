## Introduction

- [1] This is a high conflict family case. The parties have been before this Court numerous times since the father, S.C., initiated these family law proceedings against his former spouse, E.C., in August 2022.
- [2] The application before me involves the father's third application about enforcement to enforce his court ordered parenting time with his children, A.C. (currently age [omitted for publication]) and L.C. (currently age [omitted for publication]).
- [3] On December 19, 2024, I was satisfied under s. 61 of the Family Law Act (the ' Act' ) that the mother, in failing to comply with parenting orders of this Court, wrongfully denied parenting time to the father and that such conduct was flagrant, deliberate, and purposeful.
- [4] I awarded the father interim primary custody of L.C., sole decision-making authority for the children under s. 41 of the Act and imposed the extraordinary remedy of a police enforcement clause under s. 231(4) of the Act to ensure the mother's compliance with the parenting order. This Order was to remain in effect until the start of the January 6, 2025 trial on parenting time.
- [5] At the time of that hearing, the father had not seen either child since the original protection order was granted in February 2023.
- [6] The discrete issues remaining to be decided on this application are what additional remedies should be imposed against the mother for her non-compliance with parenting orders of this Court.
- [7] The father seeks reimbursement of legal fees incurred to enforce his parenting time, wasted supervised visit fees and reunification counselling expenses, and a fine under ss. 61(2)(d), (g) and (3) of the Act . Additionally, he asks the Court to impose the extraordinary remedy of imprisonment under s. 231(2) to secure the mother's future compliance with Court orders.

- [8] The mother opposes all of the relief sought on the ground that her conduct was not wrongful as she was acting in the best interests of the children at all times in her stated role as the 'protective parent.'
- [9] Ms. Gadey, appointed counsel for A.C., had no submissions to make on behalf of A.C. on the monetary relief sought but submitted that imprisoning the mother would not be in A.C.'s best interests.

## Background

- [10] The parties had been together for 13 years at the time of separation in June 2022. They have two biological children, A.C. and L.C.
- [11] The mother identifies as Indigenous and discloses that she has autism. She holds a Masters Degree in Social Work and owns and operates her own consulting practice. The mother deposes she stopped working in June 2024 due to stress.
- [12] The father is a mechanic and employed full-time by Volkswagen Canada, and has a 3-D printing business on the side.
- [13] The mother has two older sons (currently aged [omitted for publication] and [omitted for publication] years) from a previous relationship. They are no longer the subject of the father's parenting application.
- [14] The mother deposes that all four of her children are diagnosed with autism and have special needs.
- [15] The children live with the mother in a home she rents in [omitted for publication].
- [16] In June 2022, the Ministry of Children and Family Development ('MCFD') received a report regarding domestic violence within the family home. The mother signed MCFD's safety plan agreeing to leave the family home with the children should yelling, threats, or physical violence occur.

- [17] On June 22, 2022, the father was arrested and charged with common assault following an incident at the family home. He was placed on a police undertaking that he have no contact or communication with the mother.
- [18] On August 3, 2022, the father agreed to MCFD's safety plan that he would not use 'inappropriate physical discipline' with the children.
- [19] On March 16, 2023, the father's assault charge was resolved by way of a peace bond under s. 810 of Criminal Code . The father was placed on a 12-month recognizance with protective conditions that he have no contact or communication with the mother or attend at her residence except 'as allowed by a family or child protection order'. By entering into the peace bond, the father acknowledged in Court there was an incident on June 22, 2022 that caused E.C. to fear for her safety.
- [20] The father completed the recognizance without further incident or police involvement.

## Family Litigation Chronology

- [21] What follows below is a summary of the court proceedings between the parties that forms the factual basis for the findings I made against the mother at the December 19 th  hearing. The summary is lengthy but necessary to highlight the breadth and extent of the efforts the mother has undertaken to disrupt the father's relationship with the children.
- [22] On August 2, 2022, the father filed an Application About a Family Law Matter seeking, inter alia, guardianship, equal parenting time, and shared parental responsibilities of all four children. At this point, he had not seen the children since the parties' separation and was bound by bail conditions on the assault charge that he have no contact or communication with the mother.
- [23] The mother's Reply was filed on September 9, 2022. In her pleadings, she referred to herself as the 'protective parent', and as such, she opposed the relief sought by the father for equal parenting time. Instead, she proposed the sharing of parental

responsibilities with the mother having the final say, and expressed her agreement for the father to have video calls with the children that would transition to supervised visits.

[24] At para. 3 of her Reply, the mother pleaded, 'I want to ensure ongoing positive interactions between [the father] and the children while relationships are restored ...' The mother requested a neutral third party to facilitate parenting transitions stating, '[e]nsuring safety and positive connections between [the father] and the children ongoing is important to ensure they have ongoing healthy and positive relationships. Lowering conflict wherever possible is in the best interests of the children.'

[25] The parties appeared at a family management conference ('FMC') before Judge Dossa on October 11, 2022. Judge Dossa made an interim order granting the father video parenting time with all four children two evenings per week. Additionally, Judge Dossa imposed a conduct order on the parties to ensure they maintain civility and required the parties to 'speak to the Children about the other parent … in a positive and respectful manner'.

[26] On October 13, 2022, Judge A. Brown granted an order allowing supervised parenting time. At a second FMC on November 29, 2022, Judge Brown varied her order and granted unsupervised parenting time to the father with L.C. and A.C. twice weekly. A three-day hearing was also set on the father's application to begin on September 5, 2023.

[27] In January 2023, A.C. and L.C. were interviewed by a social worker. A.C. stated he did not want to see his father.

## (a) February 16, 2023 Protection Order

[28] On February 16, 2023, the mother brought an application for a protection order under s. 184 of the Act on behalf of herself and all four children owing to family violence committed by the father. The application was brought without notice by the mother with the knowledge that the father, at that time, was represented by legal counsel in their ongoing family litigation.

- [29] The protection order was issued by Judge G. Smith. The hearing on the application was brief. The mother's protection order was granted on an indefinite basis prohibiting the father from having contact or communication with the mother and the children, with limited exceptions. Additionally, term 8 of the protection order granted the mother 'all parenting time' with the four children and term 9 granted the mother 'all parenting responsibilities' as listed in s. 41 of the Act .
- [30] As the children were in her sole care, the mother assumed all decision making for the children with respect to their health, medical, and educational needs without input from the father.

## (b) The Father's Application to Set Aside the Protection Order

- [31] It was not surprising that the father made an application to set aside the protection order. The initial hearing on the father's application proceeded before Judge McQuillan on April 3, 2023. Judge McQuillan re-issued the protection order to allow for the father to have some supervised parenting time with A.C. and L.C., pending the hearing and adjourned the application for an in person hearing in late May.
- [32] The father did not receive his parenting time under this order.
- [33] After a six-day contested hearing, Judge Campbell in his Reasons, did not find the conflict between the parties 'exceptional' so as to justify a non-expiring order, but nevertheless found that a protection order with respect to the mother was warranted and would continue for a further 12 months and expire on August 8, 2023.
- [34] Judge Campbell's reasoning for a continued order for the mother is found in paras. 17, 22 and 23 of his Reasons:
- [17] In addition to this physical incident [June 22, 2022], there have been inappropriate unwanted communications since the relationship ended.  [The mother] has provided text messages and emails between herself and [the father].  There has been extensive conflict between them since the separation.  The communications show they often argued about each other's behaviour and whether or not it constitutes abuse.  [The mother] and [the father] were both active participants in this conflict.

…

[22] When cross-examined by [the mother], [the father] was often evasive, sarcastic and non-responsive to questions.  On a number of occasions, he laughed derisively at [the mother] and made unsolicited editorial comments about her.  His behaviour indicates that he has little insight on how to minimize or resolve conflict with [the mother].

[23] I accept there is a concern that [the father] would be abusive in his communications with [the mother] and that this amounts to family violence, as defined in the Family Law Act .

[35] With respect to the protection order for the four children, Judge Campbell found that:

-  Many of the concerns raised by the mother did not constitute family violence as defined by the Family Law Act , and thus did not justify a protection order, but rather were relevant to a hearing on parenting arrangements (at para. 32).
-  The mother's assertion of '[A.C.'s] deteriorating mental health when he has contact with [the father]', while 'highly relevant' to an order for parenting arrangements under the best interests principle found in s. 37 of the Family Law Act , was 'not the primary consideration in an application for a protection order, which is concerned with preventing family violence' (at para. 39).
-  The father's behaviour following the June 22, 2022 incident in calling out to the children to witness his arrest was 'unconscionable and undoubtedly caused distress to the children' (at para. 44-45).

[36] Judge Campbell also took into account the testimony of the children's behaviour consultant, C.W., who testified that A.C. 'loves his father, but had expressed fear of his father' and that A.C. would 'like to see' his father by video call but not in person 'at this time', and that L.C. 'loves his father and wants to see his father'.

[37] Finally, Judge Campbell found that the father had been compliant with the conditions of his recognizance and the protection order and there were no reports of further incidents or police involvement.

- [38] At para. 46, Judge Campbell opined:
- [46] In my view, however, the risk of the children being exposed to family violence between the parents is greatly reduced.  [The father and the mother] separated over one year ago and there is no possibility of reconciliation.  [The father] has been on a protection order without any reported problems for about six months.  There will be no contact between [the father] and [the mother] for the foreseeable future, except as may be permitted by a Family Court order due to the peace bond and the protection order that will continue for [the mother].
- [39] At para. 53, Judge Campbell concluded:
- [53] I do not find the evidence establishes a likelihood that [the father] will be physically or psychologically abusive towards [L.C.] or [A.C.]
- [40] Judge Campbell set aside the protection order for the children finding, at para. 61, that the father had 'established a change of circumstances with respect to the protection order for the children', and noting that 'much of the evidence at this hearing was not before the judge who issued the initial protection order'.
- [41] With respect to the father's two older stepchildren, Judge Dossa's conduct order was already in place and there had been no reported problems with the father's compliance with this order. The father confirmed that he was not seeking contact with his stepchildren on his application. Judge Campbell concluded with respect to his stepchildren, the evidence did not establish a likelihood of violence. He then imposed a conduct order that the father have no contact or communication with them, except with their express consent.
- [42] With regard to A.C., Judge Campbell ordered on an 'interim without prejudice basis', that the father would have parenting time by video call and in person parenting time, as approved by A.C.'s counsel, until further order. No conditions were imposed with respect to L.C.

## (c) MCFD's Family Support Services for the Father

- [43] A.C. and L.C.'s fear and anxiety around the father were raised in the testimony of the mother and C.W. in the hearing before Judge Campbell. Judge Campbell noted them to be of 'significant concern' at para. 52 of his Reasons, indicating these concerns were directly related to the upcoming hearing on parenting arrangements.
- [44] The children's concerns about their father were addressed by MCFD in their following-up dealings with the father after the termination of the protection order.
- [45] To facilitate the resumption of parenting time, MCFD conducted an assessment and concluded from that assessment that there were 'no grounds to interrupt' the father's parenting time in relation to 'reported concerns' the children were at risk of physical harm due to 'reported domestic violence towards their mother'.
- [46] MCFD opened a family support services file for the father to assist him in addressing concerns expressed by the children to MCFD about his yelling and the conflict with the mother. The father accepted MCFD's recommendations and offer of support services to assist with reintegration. More importantly, he 'voluntarily' agreed to have his parenting time supervised to address any safety concerns with the visits.
- [47] In their letter to the father dated August 23, 2023, Social Worker Megan HalperNorfolk and Team Lead Erin Myles jointly wrote: '… We have agreed that MCFD will provide a visit supervisor who will come to your home to supervise your visits with the boys while visits initially resume.'

## (d) First Enforcement Application and October 12, 2023 and January 26, 2024 Parenting Orders

- [48] The hearing on the father's application for parenting time did not proceed in September as scheduled, as Ms. Gadey, A.C.'s counsel, successfully applied to adjourn the trial on the first day of hearing. New trial dates were obtained and trial preparation orders were made.

- [49] The father then filed his first Application About Enforcement on September 15, 2023. In this application, the father sought the resumption of his parenting time under Judge Brown's July 31, 2022 order, as he still had not seen his children.
- [50] October 12, 2023, Judge McQuillan granted the father's application in part, ordering that the father have supervised parenting time with A.C. and L.C. 'as approved' by MCFD and 'supervised' by MCFD 'to commence as soon as practicable'.
- [51] Contrary to Judge McQuillan's order and despite the many efforts made by the assigned social worker to work with the mother to facilitate the visits, the mother was uncooperative with MCFD and delayed their efforts to set up visits through her lack of responsiveness.
- [52] The father did not have a single supervised visit with either child by the end of 2023.
- [53] The father's enforcement application was set for a further hearing, this time to enforce Judge McQuillan's order. The hearing proceeded on January 26, 2024 before Judge Cronin.
- [54] Each of the three MCFD social workers who testified at the hearing before Judge Cronin approved of the father having supervised parenting time with A.C. and L.C.
- [55] Judge Cronin found that the mother had 'thwarted' Judge McQuillan's order as she (the mother) 'does not agree it is in A.C. and L.C.'s best interests to have supervised parenting time with the Father' (at para. 15).
- [56] Judge Cronin further found (at para. 21) that the mother's denial of parenting was not justified, holding that the mother's belief that the children would suffer psychological harm should the father have supervised parenting time was not reasonably held. She further found that it was in the best interests of the children under s. 37 of the Act that the children see their father in a supervised setting, adding that, 'were I to accede to the Mother's submission, I expect the Children would have no parenting time with the Father at this point under any circumstances. This would usurp the Court's

determination of the best interests of the Children and place all of this decision making in the hands of the Mother, without any independent oversight' (at para. 24).

- [57] Judge Cronin concluded (at para. 25) that the mother wrongfully denied parenting time to the father contrary to s. 61 of the Act and ordered the children attend an intake meeting with the MCFD to arrange the supervised parenting time. This was to occur within one week of the ruling and the supervised parenting time was to commence within two weeks of the ruling and continue as and when directed by MCFD.

## (e) February 5, 2024 Application About A Protection Order

- [58] In response to Judge Cronin's Ruling, the mother, on February 5, 2024, brought a second without notice application for a protection order for herself and her four children. The basis for the application proceeding without notice to the father was stated by the mother in her application as follows:

Notice to the other party increase risk of severity and safety for the children and myself.  An order was made for access to start with [the father], which goes against medical documentation, diagnoses &amp; recommendations.  The children fear [the father] will kill them, their counsellor asking me to seek out homicide risk assessment recently due to their discussions.  Current Peace Bond 811 between [the father] and I and protection order.  Previous protection order for kids.  Coercive violence.

- [59] That same day, Judge Preovolos declined to hear the application on a without notice basis. Judge Preovolos ordered the mother to serve her application on the father and then adjourned the matter for hearing on March 18, 2024.
- [60] The mother abandoned her application and filed a notice of discontinuance on February 8, 2024. The father was never served with this application.

## (f)  Second Enforcement Application and Request for Scheduling on the Children's School

- [61] In March 2024, the children were interviewed by MCFD and told their social worker they did not want to see their father. No supervised visits occurred as MCFD

would not compel the children to spend time with a parent if they did not wish to see them.

[62] On March 28, 2024, the father brought a second application about enforcement as no supervised visits had occurred.

[63] On May 22, 2024, the father filed a Request for Scheduling on his originating application seeking an order for the return of the children to public school. The reason the schooling issue came about was because the mother transferred the children out of their local elementary school in [omitted for publication], where they had been attending, and enrolled them in a self-directed home based program through 'Partners in Education' ('PIE') operated through the Powell River School District. This change came about at the start of the 2023-2024 school year.

[64] The father did not support the home schooling program. He was not consulted prior to the change. He filed the request for scheduling to return the children to public school. This matter was scheduled before me on June 24 after I adjourned the trial, together with the father's second application for enforcement.

[65] The trial did not proceed at the end of May. I adjourned the trial because the s. 211 full views of the child report that was ordered was not ready and the mother brought a large volume documents to court on the first day of trial that neither the father nor Ms. Gadey had seen in advance of trial and the mother had not brought copies of the documents.

[66] I imposed document disclosure orders on the mother with a production deadline immediately following the expiry of the protection order, which she did not meet.

[67] The parties were then adjourned to June 24 before me to deal with the father's enforcement application on the issue of supervised parenting time for L.C. only, as the father decided not to pursue parenting time at this point with A.C., in light of Ms. Gadey's advice that A.C. did not want to see him. The schooling issue was also set for that same day.

- [68] A.C. was in [omitted for publication], and L.C. was in [omitted for publication] at the time of transfer into a home learning program. This was a major decision that affected both children. The father deposes in his supporting affidavit that the transfer was made without his knowledge or consent. He exhibited to his affidavit an email he received from Stephanie Hall, PIE Principal, on March 12, 2024 confirming the children's enrolment in the PIE program in September 2023 by the mother and copies of the children's individual education plans or IEPs, and two progress reports (one for each child).
- [69] The IEP forms confirm 'parent/guardian consultation' had occurred and listed only the mother as part of each child's student support team. The father's name did not appear anywhere on the IEP forms. What was clear from these documents is that the change in schooling was implemented by the mother at the time when she had sole decision making authority respecting the children's education under the original protection order, which she exercised to facilitate this change.
- [70] At the June 24 hearing, the mother was now represented by Mike Evans. The mother, through counsel, produced a small document brief in relation to the children's learning needs and agreed to provide better disclosure to the father on the merits of the home learning program for the children. The schooling issue was then adjourned over to the next hearing date.
- [71] On the father's enforcement application, the mother consented to the father's proposal for twice-weekly supervised parenting time with L.C., as MCFD had agreed to fund a visit supervisor for three months. The mother's agreement was formalized in a consent order.

## (g) Third Enforcement Application to Enforce Parenting Time

- [72] On August 20, 2024, the father filed his third Application About Enforcement to enforce his parenting time as none of his supervised visits with L.C. occurred, despite the June 24 consent order.

- [73] The hearing was set for September 12, and on that appearance, Mr. Evans put forward a series of recommendations, on instructions from the mother, to address the father's application about the children's schooling. This included the mother's agreement to appoint a neutral expert in place of behaviour consultant C.W. (whom the father objected to because of her friendship with the mother), and to further to address the mother's non-compliance with the father's parenting time.
- [74] Mr. Evans presented a draft consent order for the father's consideration. The draft order included many terms, including the equal sharing of parental responsibilities, the mother's obligation to advise the father on any matter of significance, and not to make a final decision without the father's written consent, an agreement for the parties to work collaboratively with MCFD and to participate in recommended programming, and to engage a counsellor to work on L.C.'s relationship with the father.
- [75] Importantly, the draft order re-confirmed the mother's consent to the father's supervised parenting time with L.C. on Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
- [76] The parties were adjourned over to November 29 (the next available date for counsel) for the father to seek independent legal advice on the draft order, and in the meantime, the father would have his parenting time as the mother agreed, and as I ordered.

[77] The father then engaged a private supervising service, and through them, arranged his visits with L.C. The father paid for four supervised visits for L.C. between September 24 and October 4 that were 'no shows'. He was charged $160 for each missed visit plus a $160 intake fee, which he paid.

## (h) Section 211 Report

- [78] The Section 211 Full Report ('Report') was completed and filed with the Court on October 4, 2024.
- [79] At pp. 3 and 11 of the Report, the author commented that comprehensive individual interviews of A.C. and L.C. did not occur due to the mother's stated concerns

to the author regarding the children's mental health, 'specifically the likelihood the children would have suicidal thoughts when discussing their father'.

[80] The Report's conclusions were that A.C. 'would not want to see his father at this time' (at p. 11), and that L.C.'s 'resistance' to seeing the father 'may be influenced by his older siblings and their fear of his father's anger and confusing situations involving conflict between their parents,' adding that '[L.C.] has expressed he may agree to see his father if a known trusted adult accompanied him' (at pp. 11-12).

## (i)  November 21, 2024 Trial Conference

- [81] The trial preparation conference proceeded on November 21. As this was a trial conference, the parties were required to appear in person.
- [82] An articled student appeared virtually as agent for Mr. Evans and the mother. Ms. Gadey appeared for A.C., with leave, virtually. The father appeared in person.
- [83] The father identified parenting time, parenting responsibilities, his enforcement order, and the children's schooling as the issues he wanted decided at trial in his trial readiness statement.
- [84] A.C. and the mother marked 'protection order' in their trial readiness statements as among the issues for trial, but neither counsel made submissions on this issue as a matter of ongoing concern or advised that a protection order would be sought at trial.
- [85] The father advised he had still not had any supervised visits with L.C.
- [86] The articled student had limited information on the file and did not have instructions from the mother to address the mother's non-compliance with the June 24, 2024 parenting order or to address the draft consent order. I then set an in person continuation date on the father's third enforcement application.

## (j)  November 29, 2024 Hearing on the Third Enforcement Application

[87] The father's enforcement application was to proceed on November 29, 2024. On that date, the father appeared with Chantall Long, new counsel, on this application given the mother's non-compliance with the supervised parenting orders.

[88] The mother did not appear at this hearing. Mr. Evans appeared as her agent. Mr. Evans produced a short letter from the mother's family doctor stating that she '… was assessed on November 28, 2024 for a medical issue. They require an absence from work and other scheduled activities from November 28, 2024 to November 30, 2024.'

[89] The mother provided a sworn affidavit made November 26, 2024 for the November 29 hearing. In this affidavit, the mother deposed that L.C. was fearful of the father, stating that L.C. expresses 'statements of self-harm' and 'aggression' if 'forced' into visits with his father. She further deposed that the father failed to engage with her in her efforts 'preventing progress toward safe and supported access' and that L.C.'s '… severe emotional distress underscores the urgency of addressing this issue with a focus on his psychological safety'.

[90] The statements made by the mother in this affidavit against the father were broadly stated and vague. They lacked clear detail that explained how or what the father continued to do to make L.C. fearful, what the father did to 'prevent progress toward safe and supported access', and what the mother expected the father to do to meet the mother's objective so the visits could commence beyond what he had already agreed to do by agreeing to supervised visits (which had the backing from MCFD), and by working as directed with MCFD on family reintegration.

[91] As a last effort to facilitate some parenting time for the father over the Christmas holiday, counsel for the father proposed that a mutual family friend, C.A., whom L.C. 'loves' (according to the father), supervise at least one visit with the father and L.C. This proposal was in line with one suggestion made in the s. 211 Report for parenting time for L.C. Mr. Evans supported this proposal.

[92] The hearing was adjourned over to December 19. The mother was required to appear in person.

[93] Three attempts were then made by Ms. Long on December 3, 9, and 16, 2024 to arrange parenting time for L.C. with C.A. supervising. The mother did not respond to these requests until December 16, when Mr. Evans replied advising that the mother would not agree to the supervised visits.

## (k) December 19, 2024 Hearing on the Third Enforcement Application and Interim Order Transfering Care of L.C. to the Father

[94] By the time of the December 19 hearing, the father had not seen either child since February 2023 when the original protection order was granted.

[95] The father filed supporting affidavits for the hearing and appeared with counsel to enforce his parenting time. The father also had contacted his social worker and received a funding commitment from MCFD to provide supports to assist the children with the transition to his care, if this were so ordered.

[96] Mr. Evans, appearing as agent for the mother, sought an adjournment of the hearing as he had been instructed by the mother that she had a surgery the previous day, was on pain killers and feeling unwell, and could not attend. I refused the adjournment and the hearing proceeded.

[97] The mother would have been well aware of the importance of this court date, yet she failed to provide Mr. Evans with some basic information about her surgery ( i.e. , whether it was medical, dental, pre-planned, or urgent) to support the adjournment application. She did not notify the father through counsel of her surgery date. She did not provide a doctor's note to excuse her from attending court as she had provided on the previous court date, and she did not provide documentation to counsel to corroborate her surgery date, such as a booking confirmation or discharge summary.

- [98] This was the mother's third missed personal court appearance in a row and it had all the hallmarks of a delay tactic. I refused the adjournment and the hearing proceeded.
- [99] I found that the father had been wrongfully denied parenting time by the mother. I found that the mother breached orders of this Court for parenting time, and that the mother's conduct in doing so was purposeful, flagrant, and repeated.
- [100] I ordered that L.C.'s primary residence would be with the father until the start of trial with the mother having reasonable parenting time over the holidays and at further times agreeable between the parties. My order was made police enforceable under s. 231(4) of the Act , as I was satisfied there were no other options to ensure the mother's compliance.
- [101] The mother was further ordered not to make any major decisions respecting the children without written notice to the father and without his written consent. The father was given all parental responsibilities for the children under s. 41 of the Act .
- [102] The mother was also ordered to provide to the father a schedule and location of the children's activities over the holidays by December 23, 2024 (which she did not provide).
- [103] The scheduled transfer of custody was to occur the following day. My order was to remain in force until the start of trial on January 6, 2025. The parties were adjourned to a later date to address the balance of the relief sought by the father.

## Post-Hearing Events and Adjournment of the January 6 Trial

- [104] Following the issuance of my order, the mother twice attempted to have L.C. admitted to hospital prior to the scheduled transfer of custody on December 20. She reported to hospital staff that L.C. was 'mentally unwell' and 'suicidal'.
- [105] Judge Campbell was tasked with deciding the interim parenting arrangements for the children at a hearing on January 6 and 9, 2025, after the parties jointly applied to adjourn the January 6 trial. He reviewed the hospital records produced by the father

respecting L.C.'s two attendances at Surrey Memorial Hospital on December 19 and 20, noting the following from his review in his Ruling:

- [34] [L.C.] was assessed by hospital staff.  The hospital records indicate that after 'multiple prompts' from [the mother], [L.C.] stated that he wanted to use a knife to kill [the father] and himself.
- [35] [L.C.] was then assessed by a psychiatrist.  He again stated that the wanted to kill himself and father.  He agreed to behave himself when told that this was not allowed.  He denied any genuine suicidal intent.
- [36] Hospital staff consulted the MCFD, who advised that allegations by [the mother] have been investigated and deemed to be unsubstantiated. The MCFD declined to be involved.  They confirmed that there were no child protection concerns with respect to [the father].
- [37] The psychiatrist who assessed [L.C.] concluded that there were no psychiatric concerns requiring hospitalization.  The psychiatrist documented the concern that the family (i.e. [the mother]) was attempting to use the emergency room for the purpose of the legal dispute.
- [106] On the strong advice of the attending psychiatrist, the mother agreed to facilitate L.C.'s transfer of custody to the father. The transfer did, in fact, occur without incident.
- [107] Over the holidays, L.C. re-connected with his grandparents and extended family, participated in many outings and activities with the father, and had a happy and positive experience with his father. The father enrolled L.C. back into his local elementary school.
- [108] At the January hearing, the issue of the father's history of family violence was again raised by the mother in support of her submission to return to the status quo of having primary care of both children. Judge Campbell addressed the issue of family violence in his Reasons as follows:
- [69] The allegations of violence were thoroughly canvassed at a multiday protection order hearing in 2023.  The Court found that the evidence at the protection order hearing did not support a protection order with respect to the children.
- [70] The MCFD reportedly does not have any concerns at this time with respect to [the father] caring for the children.
- [71] The history of the proceeding raises the concern that [the mother] uses allegations of family violence as a means of obstructing [the father's]

parenting time.  For example, she told hospital staff that [the father] would 'come (to the hospital) and hurt them'.  There was no reasonable basis for this allegation.  She alleged to hospital staff that [the father] locked her up for six months during their relationship.  This allegation is not consistent with evidence at the protection order hearing.  She also told hospital staff that [the father] had been monitoring her with drones for a year.  The evidence raises concerns that these allegations are not credible and were made in an attempt to avoid the court order.

- [109] I have reviewed the Surrey Memorial Hospital Records as well.
- [110] From my review, I note that a social worker intervention report was prepared by the on duty social worker, Nav Bhatia, on December 20, 2024. The purpose of this report was to follow up with MCFD regarding the mother's stated mental health concerns for L.C. Social Worker Bhatia spoke to MCFD social worker Kirsten Milholm, who confirmed that 'the allegations suggested by [the mother] have been investigated by MCFD and deemed unsubstantiated.' Social Worker Bhatia concluded her report with the statement that 'there are no outstanding child protection concerns at this time.'
- [111] In his Ruling, Judge Campbell ordered the parties to share equal parenting time with L.C. He ordered reunification counselling for A.C. and the father. Judge Campbell made the parenting time police enforceable under s. 231(4) of the Family Law Act until March 31. He ordered the parties to share all parental responsibilities for the children with neither party making major decisions nor attending children's appointments without the advance consent of the other party. Finally, Judge Campbell ordered the parties to advise each other of the children's schedule of appointments and extra-curricular activities by January 31, 2025.
- [112] On the issue of the children's appointments and extra-curricular activities, at para. 9-10 of his affidavit made January 7, 2025, the father deposes:
9.  … I have had no chance to see or speak to [A.C.] despite there being multiply [sic] parenting time Orders including the recent Order where I was to attend the children's activities.
10. I have no idea what activities he is doing or what doctors he has been seeing as [the mother] does not communicate any information per the Order and this has been the case since separation …

[113] The father deposes in a follow-up affidavit made March 18, 2025, at para. 5, that the mother did not provide the children's schedules to the father by January 31 as ordered by Judge Campbell, and has still not provided the schedule.

- [114] The mother did not address the reason for her delay and non-compliance with both Judge Campbell's and my orders for the children's appointment and extracurricular activities schedule in her March 25, 2025 affidavit. She was asked by me during the hearing on May 13, 2025 for her response on this issue. She did not provide a satisfactory answer for her lack of compliance in providing this information to the father.

## Reunification Counselling for A.C.

- [115] Since Judge Campbell's January 20 Order, A.C. attended 15 individual reunification counselling sessions and developed a good rapport with the counsellor, Roland Boutin. The father attended two reunification sessions with the same counsellor.
- [116] The father, in consultation with the counsellor, planned to attend the session with A.C. on March 9 and sent an email to the mother two days prior to confirm the plan for his attendance and requesting that she let A.C. know ahead of the session.
- [117] A.C. was unaware of the plan. He told Mr. Boutin that he did not want the father to be included in their counselling session and elected to have an individual session instead. The mother had a private meeting with Mr. Boutin before the session began. A.C. then had his counselling session with Mr. Boutin.
- [118] The father waited offsite, and did not see A.C. or the mother.
- [119] The mother, in her reply affidavit made March 25, 2025, deposes that she missed the father's March 9 email and was thus 'unaware' the father would be attending A.C.'s counselling session with Mr. Boutin. This is why she explains A.C. was not informed of this fact ahead of time. The reason the mother missed the email, she explains in her affidavit, was because she was 'following advice' received from the police to check her emails less frequently due to the father's 'ongoing harassment'.

[120] The next day (March 10, 2025), the parties received an email from Sonja Friedland, Clinical Director for Bright Star Counselling, terminating services for reunification counselling. This decision was made after the mother's meeting with Mr. Boutin. The reason given for termination was the mother's 'threat' to report the counsellor to their professional body for 'unethical practice'. Ms. Friedland wrote:

Roland [the counsellor] and I met this evening to discuss your family situation and how best to support all of you going forward.  Given the threat [the mother] openly made to our clinic, to file a complaint to our professional colleges based on unfounded allegation of unethical practise, we cannot in good faith work towards reunification.  Having trust in the reunification process is vital to a positive outcome.

[121] The mother put her threat of reporting Mr. Boutin to his professional body aside when she approached Mr. Boutin a couple weeks later by email to request continued counselling for A.C. By reply email to the mother dated March 21, 2025, Mr. Boutin agreed to continue individual (but not reunification) counselling for A.C. provided that 'therapy for [A.C.] and/or L.C. will not be to obtain information that will be used in court'.

[122] In his affidavit made May 8, 2025, the father deposes that he is now back to 'scratch' with A.C. with Bright Star's termination of reunification counselling services. This means he will have to find another reunification counsellor that he cannot easily afford. He asked the mother to pay for the sessions and she refused. The father paid $3,840 for 17 counselling sessions in total with Roland Boutin.

## March 26, 2025 Continuation on the Father's Third Enforcement Application

- [123] The parties appeared before me for the continuation on the father's third enforcement application to address the additional remedies sought against the mother for the wrongful denial of parenting time and continued breach of the parenting orders.
- [124] The mother was put on notice through counsel at the November 29 and December 19 hearings that the father would seek the extraordinary remedy of imprisonment in addition to fines, reimbursement of legal fees, and other expenses

occasioned by the mother's purposeful and continued denial of the father's parenting time. A half-day hearing on these issues was then set for March 26, 2025.

[125] The mother's conduct at the March 26 hearing was unacceptable. The mother was confrontational and disrespectful. She accused the Court of bias. Her tone of voice was hostile. She raised the issue of family violence as justification for her actions in withholding parenting time in her role as the protective parent. She wanted a further protection order.

[126] When the mother settled down, I informed her of the seriousness of the relief being sought, including a term of imprisonment, and asked the mother to reflect carefully and offered to give her another opportunity to respond to the relief sought by the father. The hearing was then adjourned to May 13 for that purpose.

[127] The continuation proceeded on May 13. The mother's behaviour in court on that day was equally disrespectful and confrontational. She demanded I recuse myself as the judge from this case. The mother also advised that she filed an Application About a Protection Order against the father to address the issue of family violence that she wanted heard ex parte right away and handed up a copy of her filed application.

[128] The father deposed in his affidavit of May 8 that the mother withheld L.C. at the start of his parenting week on May 3. The mother confirmed that she had done so at the hearing. She confirmed she knew about and understood her obligations under Judge Campbell's parenting order.

[129] I told the parties that the mother's protection application would be adjourned to another date so the father could respond to that application, and to afford the father the opportunity to bring forward these new allegations of breach of Judge Campbell's parenting order (which are currently before Judge Campbell).

[130] I reminded the mother of the enforcement remedies that were likely being sought by the father on the new issues, including extraordinary remedies, and indicated that she should be prepared to address them at the next hearing date. I urged the mother to

reconsider her position and comply with Judge Campbell's parenting order before the next hearing date.

- [131] I reserved judgment on the matters before me.

## Legal Framework

- [132] Section 37 of the Act requires the parties and the Court to consider only the best interests of the child. This principle applies to all existing child custody questions, including the question of parenting time: See M.W.B. v. A.R.B. , 2013 B.C.S.C. 885, at para. 176. Both parties and A.C. rely on the best interests principle in asserting their respective positions on this application. This principle has overarching importance in this case.
- [133] The father seeks monetary relief under s. 61(2) of the Act and imprisonment under s. 231(2) of the Act.
- [134] Division 5 of the Act sets out the applicable statutory framework for a person seeking compliance with parenting or contact orders or agreements. The remedies found in ss. 61(2) and (3) are restorative and compensatory where a person has been denied parenting time or contact with a child by a child's guardian. Section 61 is set out below in full and states:
4. 61(1) An application under this section may be made only
5. (a) by a person entitled under an agreement or order to parenting time or contact with a child, and
6. (b) within 12 months after the person was denied parenting time or contact with a child.
- (2) If satisfied that an applicant has been wrongfully denied parenting time or contact with a child by a child's guardian, the court on application may make an order to do one or more of the following:
8. (a) require the parties to participate in family dispute resolution;
9. (b) require one or more parties or, without the consent of the child's guardian, the child, to attend counselling, specified services or programs;

- (c) specify a period of time during which the applicant may exercise compensatory parenting time or contact with the child;
- (d) require the guardian to reimburse the applicant for expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred by the applicant as a result of the denial, including travel expenses, lost wages and child care expenses;
- (e) require that the transfer of the child from one party to another be supervised by another person named in the order;
- (f)  if the court is satisfied that the guardian may not comply with an order made under this section, order that guardian to
- (i) give security in any form the court directs, or
- (ii)  report to the court, or to a person named by the court, at the time and in the manner specified by the court;
- (g) require the guardian to pay
- (i) an amount not exceeding $5 000 to or for the benefit of the applicant or a child whose interests were affected by the denial, or
- (ii)  a fine not exceeding $5 000.

(3) If the court makes an order under subsection (2) (a), (b) or (e), the court may allocate among the parties, or require one party alone to pay, the fees relating to the family dispute resolution, counselling, service, program or transfer.

62 (1) For the purposes of section 61 [denial of parenting time or contact], a denial of parenting time or contact with a child is not wrongful in any of the following circumstances:

- (a) the guardian reasonably believed the child might suffer family violence if the parenting time or contact with the child were exercised;
- (b) the guardian reasonably believed the applicant was impaired by drugs or alcohol at the time the parenting time or contact with the child was to be exercised;
- (c) the child was suffering from an illness when the parenting time or contact with the child was to be exercised and the guardian has a written statement, by a medical practitioner or nurse practitioner, indicating that it was not appropriate that the parenting time or contact with the child be exercised;
- (d) in the 12-month period before the denial, the applicant failed repeatedly and without reasonable notice or excuse to exercise parenting time or contact with the child;

- (e) the applicant
- (i) informed the guardian, before the parenting time or contact with the child was to be exercised, that it was not going to be exercised, and
- (ii)  did not subsequently give reasonable notice to the guardian that the applicant intended to exercise the parenting time or contact with the child after all;
- (f)  other circumstances the court considers to be sufficient justification for the denial.
- (2) If, on an application under section 61, the court finds that parenting time or contact with a child was denied, but was not wrongfully denied, the court may make an order specifying a period of time during which the applicant may exercise compensatory parenting time or contact with the child.
- [135] Division 6 pertains to enforcement remedies. These remedies are intended to enforce and secure compliance with court orders: A.N. v. A.M.N., 2021 BCSC 2228, at para. 41; Kanta v. Kanta, 2017 BCSC 2321, at para. 19; J.H. v. D.G. , 2023 BCPC 209, at para. 69.
- [136] The father seeks an order for imprisonment under s. 231(2), which is an extraordinary enforcement remedy where a person fails to comply with an order made under the Act and the Court is satisfied that no other order under the Act will be sufficient to secure that person's compliance. It is a discretionary remedy.
- [137] Subsection (2) empowers the Court to imprison a person for a maximum of 30 days, provided the person be first given a reasonable opportunity to explain why an order for imprisonment should not be made. The mother was given that opportunity at the hearing on March 26 and May 13, 2025.
- [138] Subsections (4) to (6) empower the Court to require the police to locate and apprehend a child where there has been a wrongful denial of parenting time or contact under s. 61. These are known as police assist orders. Two such orders were granted against the mother. The first was my December 19, 2024 Order and the second was Judge Campbell's January 20, 2025 Order. Both orders were time limited.

- [139] Section 231 is set out in full below and states:
2. 231(1) This section applies if
3. (a) a person fails to comply with an order made under this Act, and
4. (b) the court is satisfied that no other order under this Act will be sufficient to secure the person's compliance.
- (2) Subject to section 188 [enforcing orders respecting protection], the court may make an order that a person be imprisoned for a term of no more than 30 days.
- (3) For the purposes of subsection (2),
7. (a) a person must first be given a reasonable opportunity to explain the person's non-compliance and show why an order under this section should not be made,
8. (b) for the purpose of bringing a person before the court to show why an order for imprisonment should not be made, the court may issue a warrant for the person's arrest, and
9. (c) imprisonment of a person under this section does not discharge any duties of the person owing under an order made under this Act.
- (4) If satisfied under section 61 [denial of parenting time or contact] that a person has been wrongfully denied parenting time or contact with a child by the child's guardian, a court may make an order requiring a police officer to apprehend the child and take the child to the person.
- (5) If satisfied that a person having contact with a child has wrongfully withheld the child from a guardian of the child, a court may make an order requiring a police officer to apprehend the child and take the child to the guardian.
- (6) For the purpose of locating and apprehending a child in accordance with an order made under subsection (4) or (5), a police officer may enter and search any place the police officer has reasonable and probable grounds for believing the child to be.

## Discussion

[140] The father clearly established on the evidence that there has been a repeated denial of his parenting time by the mother over a prolonged period, contrary to at least three parenting orders of this Court after the protection order was terminated by Judge Campbell on August 8, 2023. The mother knew exactly what her obligations were under each order and has purposefully not complied with any of them. The father met his burden under s. 61 of the Act .

[141] Section 62(1) permits reasonable denials of parenting time with the best interests of the children being the only consideration: J.H. v. D.G., supra , at para. 68, citing A.N. v. A.M.N. , supra , at para. 17.

[142] The mother sought to re-litigate the reasonable denial issue during submissions at this hearing. She maintains her position that her actions were not wrongful, submitting that the risk of family violence remains a pressing concern that justified the withholding of parenting time in her role as the 'protective parent'. It is apparent from her submissions that the mother does not agree that it is in A.C. and L.C.'s best interests to have parenting time in any form with their father.

[143] The mother submits that her non-compliance with the parenting orders was done in the best interests of the children under s. 37 of the Act , to prevent further psychological harm to the children. To this end, she relies on s. 62(1)(a) of the Act to argue her position, asserting that her actions were reasonable given her stated beliefs.

[144] I have re-reviewed the affidavit evidence of both parties before me at this hearing and I have carefully considered the mother's submissions at this hearing. It is my conclusion that the mother's beliefs that the children are at risk of family violence, were they to have parenting time with the father, are unreasonably held and not credible, given Judge Campbell's Ruling terminating the protection order, Judge's Cronin's Ruling on the father's first enforcement application, MCFD's position that the mother's stated mental health concerns for L.C. during his December 19 and 20, 2024 hospital attendances were unsubstantiated, the attending psychiatrist's stated concern that the mother was attempting to use the emergency room visits for L.C. for the purpose of a legal dispute, and MCFD's position that there were 'no outstanding child protection concerns' for the father caring for the children at this time.

[145] At the hearing on December 19, I determined that the mother's repeated denial of the father's parenting time was wrongful. I maintain that conclusion. I am also concerned that the mother is using allegations of family violence as a sword to disrupt the father's parenting time and relationship with A.C. and L.C. Such conduct is detrimental to the best interests of the children.

- [146] Regrettably, the denial of the father's parenting time is ongoing as the mother withheld the father's parenting time for L.C. starting May 3, knowing her obligations under Judge Campbell's January 2025 parenting order.
- [147] Court orders must be abided. The mother has not abided the parenting orders of this Court. The importance of complying with court orders is fundamental to the administration of justice and the rule of law. In A.J.F. v. N.L.S., 2020 BCSC 26, at para. 75, Justice Skolrood (as he then was) discussed the importance of this requirement in the context of an application to enforce conduct orders under s. 228 and s. 230 of the Act :
- [75] In this regard, there can be no debate about the importance of complying with court orders. Compliance is not a matter of discretion or choice on the part of litigants. Rather, compliance is fundamental to the proper administration of justice and maintenance of the rule of law: Grewal v. Nijjer , 2011 BCSC 332 at para. 20, aff'd 2011 BCCA 505; R.A. v. W.A. , 2018 BCSC 1910 at para. 131; Larkin v. Glase , 2009 BCCA 321 at para. 7; The Law Society of British Columbia v. Goodwin , 2015 BCSC 2472 at para. 15.
- [148] And at paras. 85 and 86, Justice Skolrood further states:
- [85] The measures set out in ss. 228 and 230 should be resorted to when, and only to the extent, necessary and appropriate to enforce and secure compliance with orders made under the FLA : Kanta v. Kanta , 2017 BCSC 2321 at para. 19; Kanta v. Kanta , 2017 BCSC 1428 at para. 72. Orders under ss. 228 and 230 may be necessary to impart on one or both parties that they are bound by the FLA and must comply with court orders: B.G.M.S. v. J.E.B. , 2018 BCSC 1628 at para. 177.
- [86] Although compliance with the FLA and related court orders is critical, the FLA mandates a more holistic approach to resolving family disputes that minimizes delay, formality and conflict between the parties: s. 199(1). The remedies available under ss. 228 and 230 empower the court to provide progressively more serious responses as a particular case may dictate. More importantly, a court's objective should be to fashion a remedy that ensures compliance while addressing the specific situation before the court: J.R.B. v. J.H.F. , 2015 BCPC 70 at para. 26.

[149] Justice Skolrood's reasoning is apposite to the remedies sought by the father under s. 61(2) and s. 231(2) of the Act on this application. The mother must be held to account for her disobedience of the parenting orders. The father seeks monetary relief under s. 61(2) of the Act and imprisonment under s. 231(2) of the Act to ensure her future compliance with these orders .

- [150] I will first address the extraordinary remedy of imprisonment.
- [151] The father seeks this remedy to ensure that the mother is held accountable for her repeated breaches of the parenting orders and to ensure future compliance with orders of this Court.
- [152] The mother and Ms. Gadey on behalf of A.C. oppose this remedy. I have already addressed the mother's position earlier in my Reasons. In brief submissions, Ms. Gadey submits that it would not be in A.C.'s best interests if his mother were imprisoned, as this would leave the child without his primary care provider.
- [153] I do not agree with Ms. Gadey's submission. It is not in the best interests of A.C. or L.C. that their mother disobey orders of this Court that were made in their best interests. Ms. Gadey did not point to any other remedies that would bring home the importance to the mother of following orders of this Court, particularly in light of recent events earlier this month with the mother's denial of the father's parenting time under Judge Campbell's Order. The mother's repeated breaches of the parenting orders are nothing short of extraordinary.
- [154] In light of the mother's flagrant, repeated, and prolonged acts of disobedience, I am satisfied pursuant to ss. 231(1)(a), (b) and (2) of the Act that there is no other order apart from imprisonment I can impose that will be sufficient to secure the mother's compliance with the parenting orders of this Court. I will, however, exercise restraint by not imposing jail this time to give the mother once last chance going forward to follow the parenting orders of this Court and avoid imprisonment: See, T.B. v. S.S., 2021 BCPC 159, at paras. 23-24.

[155] I will now turn to the compensatory relief sought by the father on this application. Judges are empowered with broad remedies under s. 61(2) to ensure compliance by compelling the wrongdoer to do 'one or more' of the enumerated remedies set out above. These remedies may be cumulative.

[156] In this case, the father seeks relief under subsection (2)(d) for reimbursement of expenses, specifically legal fees, counselling, and visit supervisor fees, 'reasonably and necessarily incurred' to seek the enforcement of his parenting time, (g) payment of a sum not exceeding $5,000 for the benefit of the father 'whose interests were affected by the denial' or a fine, and subsection (3) reimbursement for reunification counselling services paid by the father.

[157] The father was self-represented on his three enforcement applications until November 29, 2024 when Ms. Long came on record as counsel. I disallow the father's claim for reimbursement of legal fees of $20,375.74 from his former counsel, as these fees do not relate to the three enforcement applications.

[158] I will allow the legal fees and disbursements incurred by the father for legal services rendered by Ms. Long's firm. I have reviewed the invoices produced by Ms. Long's firm and find they were reasonably and necessarily incurred by the father to prosecute his third enforcement application, as a result of the mother's denials. I award the father the sum of $15,000, as sought, for those services under s. 61(2)(d) of the Act for the period November 26, 2024, when legal services began, until March 18, 2025, the date of the father's supporting affidavit, and additionally, I award a further sum of $1,000 towards counsel fees for their preparation and attendance at the two half-day hearings on March 26 and May 13, 2025.

[159] The father engaged Access 4 Parents, to supervise his visits with L.C. I find these expenses were reasonably and necessarily incurred by the father as a result of the mother's denial of parenting time. The father paid for four supervised visits between September 24 and October 4 that were 'no shows'. He was charged $640.00 for these services, which he has paid. These were wasted services due to the mother's noncompliance. I award the father this sum under s. 61(2)(d) of the Act .

[160] Judge Campbell ordered that A.C. attend reunification counselling with the father under the following term of his January 20, 2025 order:

3.  [The father] will have parenting time with [A.C.] not less than once every three weeks in the presence of a counsellor experienced in family reunification.  The counsellor and counselling sessions may be solely arranged by [the father].  [A.C.] is obligated to attend the counselling sessions.
- [161] The father incurred $3,840 for reunification counselling for 17 sessions (15 for A.C. and two for the father) with Roland Boutin of Bright Star Counselling. I accept the father's sworn evidence and find that Bright Star Counselling terminated reunification services as a direct result of the mother's actions in threatening to report the counsellor to their regulatory body for 'unethical practices'. The father is back to 'square one' and must find another service to continue reunification counselling. Pursuant to s. 61(3) of the Act , I order the mother to reimburse the father the entirety of those expenses.

[162] The father, in his March 18, 2025 affidavit, deposes that he has taken 'numerous times off work to facilitate all of my enforcement applications, which has directly affected my income and performance'. I accept the father's sworn evidence and find that his interests have been directly affected by the mother's prolonged denials of his court ordered parenting time. I award the father the sum of $2,500 which is one-half of the maximum amount that can be awarded under s. 62(2)(g)(i) of the Act.

- [163] The total sum I award to the father is $22,980.00.
- [164] The mother operates a consulting business and employs a nanny full-time. She deposes that she has not been working since June 2024. She produced no documentation at the hearing to verify her current income. Why the mother is not working was not clearly explained in her affidavits or during submissions.

[165] The mother's sworn financial statement filed April 15, 2024 discloses that she reported 2023 gross self-employment income from her consulting business of $116,878.60, gross rental income of $38,400, and grant income of $21,000. She discloses post-separation combined cash investments (excluding RRSPs, and RESPs)

of $286,597. She owns a 2022 Chrysler Pacifica van, and discloses debts of $6,317. She pays monthly rent for her home where she operates her business of $4,000.

- [166] The mother's financial statement demonstrates that she can earn a good income, and that she has significant cash assets. I am satisfied she has the ability to pay this award in full. I order the mother to pay this award to the father by July 31, 2025 . However, given the mother's track record of non-compliance, I am not satisfied that she , appear before me in person on August 6, 2025, in summary proceedings court,

will comply with this Order. Therefore, I order that the mother, pursuant to s. 61(2)(f) of the Act courtroom 4 at 9:30 am to afford her an opportunity to explain her non-compliance.
