Vancouver, B.C. December 2, 2015

- [1] THE COURT: The parties are the parents of Isaac and Jacob. In 2004 the court granted an order by consent that the children reside primarily with the respondent and the parties share joint custody and guardianship, with the respondent having final decision-making authority. The claimant was provided with reasonable and general access.
- [2] In 2005 the claimant moved to Alberta and then in 2007 to Saskatchewan. In 2008 the order was varied to provide the claimant with access on alternating Christmas breaks, spring breaks, and every summer for one month, as well as access in B.C. with 48 hours' notice to the respondent, and unlimited telephone access. In that same order the parties were granted a divorce.
- [3] The claimant now applies to vary the 2004 order to allow Isaac to reside primarily with him in Saskatchewan and to provide him with final decision-making power in the event the parties cannot agree on guardianship issues.
- [4] Isaac is 14, almost 15. According to the claimant, Isaac has for many years expressed a wish to live with him.

## Overview

- [5] The claimant and his wife, Janna, live in Willow Bunch, Saskatchewan, a very small town of about 250 people. Janna, has two children ages 19 and 16. The oldest child is now independent. The younger child lives with his father. The closest high school is located in Assiniboia, which is about 47 kilometres away.
- [6] Isaac lives in Mission with the respondent, his stepfather of several years, Jacob, and his much younger brother, Jackson. All of Isaac's extended family reside in the Lower Mainland, including his maternal and paternal grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, as well as his stepfather's family.
- [7] Isaac attends Mission Secondary School.

- [8] Both Jacob and Isaac have some special needs. Jacob is developmentally delayed. Isaac has learning difficulties, an ongoing tremor in both hands that results in weak fine motor skills, and problems with his vision. He is now in grade 10.
- [9] A recent psychoeducational assessment indicates Isaac was identified as having a learning disability in math in 2009. In elementary school he received learning assistance to help him complete school work and improve his language art skills. He also received additional support in math and participated in an adapted math program.
- [10] Isaac has been provided with an individual education plan each year given his designation as a student with special needs. In middle school he continued to receive learning support, part of which included two to three 70-minute learning assistance classes each week.
- [11] His most recent individual education plan and the psychoeducational assessment set out that he continues to demonstrate significant challenges in a number of areas. He continues to attend learning assistance classes at school and also receives tutoring twice a month at home. He is provided with a school laptop to aid him with writing assignments.
- [12] Despite the terms of the most recent order, and an annual income for the last several years that well exceeds $100,000, the claimant has exercised access in the summertime only, stating he has been unable to afford more frequent visits.

## Application to Vary

- [13] The claimant's application is brought pursuant to s.17(5) of the Divorce Act , which permits a custody order to be varied where there has been a material change in the child's circumstances and the order sought is bound to be in the child's best interest.
- [14] The order the claimant seeks to vary, however, was granted prior to the order for divorce and it does not specify whether joint custody was granted pursuant to the

Divorce Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. 3 (2 nd Supp.) or the Family Relations Act, [RSBC 1996] c. 128 (' FRA ') . Further, neither statute provided for a free-standing order concerning a child's primary residence.

- [15] If the 2004 order for joint custody was made pursuant to the Divorce Act, it was an interim order and the claimant is not required to establish a material change in circumstances. If the order was made instead under the Family Relations Act, it was a final order and must meet the requirements for variation now under the Family Law Act .

## Interpreting the Order

- [16] The meaning of a court order, including its statutory foundation, is determined by the objective indicia found in the pleadings, the wording of the order, and the circumstances in which it was made. In the absence of objective indicia , the doctrine of paramountcy will apply and the order will be 'founded' in the Divorce Act : Yu v. Jordan , 2012 BCCA 367, at para. 1. I note the 2004 order refers to Jacob and Isaac as children of the marriage, language found only in the Divorce Act , a factor that leads to the conclusion the custody order was granted under the Divorce Act. I conclude the 2004 consent order that provided the parties with joint custody and the respondent with primary residence was an interim order under the Divorce Act . The claimant, therefore, does not bear the legal burden of showing there has been a material change of circumstances.

## Relocation

- [17] Both parties took the position the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Gordon v. Goertz, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 27 sets out the legal principles that apply to the claimant's application. I agree. Although Gordon involved a variation application, the courts have determined its approach also governs initial relocation applications. The relevant aspects of the decision are summarized at para. 49:

If the threshold is met, the judge on the application must embark on a fresh inquiry into what is in the best interests of the child, having regard to all the relevant circumstances relating to the child's needs and the ability of the respective parents to satisfy them.

The inquiry does not begin with a legal presumption in favour of the custodial parent, although the custodial parent's views are entitled to great respect.

Each case turns on its own unique circumstances. The only issue is the best interest of the child in the particular circumstances of the case.

More particularly the judge should consider, inter alia :

- (a) the existing custody arrangement and relationship between the child and the custodial parent;
- (b) the existing access arrangement and the relationship between the child and the access parent;
- (c) the desirability of maximizing contact between the child and both parents;
- (d) the views of the child;
- (e) the custodial parent's reason for moving, only in the exceptional case where it is relevant to that parent's ability to meet the needs of the child;
- (f) disruption to the child of a change in custody;
- (g) disruption to the child consequent on removal from family, schools, and the community he or she has come to know.
- [18] Section 16(10) of the Divorce Act provides the court must give effect to the principle a child should have as much contact with each parent as is consistent with that child's best interest and consider the willingness of the parent seeking custody to facilitate such contact. In Gordon , the court clarified that although the maximum contact principle has been called mandatory, it is not absolute. A reduction in beneficial contact between the child and a parent does not always prevent a change of custody or an order moving the child.
- [19] In this case, the parties make various allegations against one another related to parenting. The claimant complains of unmonitored physical conflict between Isaac and Jacob, insensitivity to Isaac's wishes, favouritism of Jacob, and failing to provide adequate academic assistance to Isaac. The respondent complains Isaac accessed adult only websites while in the claimant's care and he has generally demonstrated a lack of interest in the boys over the years.

[20] Based on all of the evidence I am not concerned about the parenting ability of either party. It is clear the parties have very poor communication with one another. I am of the view the claimant has placed undue weight on Isaac's complaints about life at home, none of which are out of the ordinary for a teenage boy living in a busy household with two working parents and two other children, where the expectations of him are likely higher than those of Jacob given his greater special needs. In any event, I do not take from the claimant's evidence an intention to assert Isaac is unsafe in the respondent's home based on the altercations the boys have had in recent years. Instead, he is trying to show that he and his wife are able to offer a better environment for Isaac and will be more responsive to his needs.

## An Older Child's Wishes

- [21] The claimant states he brings his application primarily because of Isaac's wishes and argues they should be given significant weight relying upon O'Connell v. McIndoe, (1998), 42 R.F.L. (4 th ) 77 (B.C.C.A.) and Alexander v. Alexander, 1985 R.F.L. (3d) 363 in the main. Both O'Connell and Alexander involved teenaged children who were subject to custody orders contrary to their wishes.
- [22] In O'Connell the trial judge found the father had turned the children against the mother. They refused all contact with her. The trial judge granted custody of the younger child who was 13 to the mother along with a therapy regime for the father and child. While not disagreeing with the trial judge's findings, a majority of the Court of Appeal overturned the decision, concluding it was not practical to make a custody order regarding a teen that did not reasonably conform to his wishes. At para. 15 the majority also concluded the damage to the relationship between the mother and the children could not be repaired and was likely to be exacerbated by forcing the child to act against his will.
- [23] In Alexander , the trial judge awarded custody of an 11-year-old boy to his father despite the boy's express wish to live with his mother. The order was upheld on appeal. When the boy was 14 there was another appeal from an application to vary the earlier order that was refused by the chambers judge. The boy had

continued to reaffirm his wish to live with his mother. The appeal was allowed. At para. 12 the Court of Appeal wrote:

… there does come a point when at near adult years a child capable of responsible thought must now be deemed to be able to settle his own future in this important matter. Concomitant with that he must take the responsibility for his own actions. I think that that point has now been reached. For three years or more he has been unswerving in his wishes and no change is to be expected. It is not fair to push this boy to the point of rebellion …

- [24] More recently the courts have been less willing to abide by an older child's wishes where there are problems of undue influence, estrangement, or alienation. In Dowe v. Selmer , 2015 BCSC 1870 a 15-year-old child was ordered to move to Campbell River to live with his father despite his wish to remain in Iowa where he had always resided. The trial judge considered that wish but concluded it was in his best interest to experience the Canadian side of his family and Canada itself.
- [25] D.J.S. v. J.M.D., 2018 BCSC 1143 set out a similar approach to the views of a 12-year-old child:
- [39]  While the court will give increasing weight to a child's wishes as they relate to custody and access between the ages of 12 and 16, once a child reaches the age of 16 the courts generally allow a child to make their own decision about access and place of residence. However, a child's wishes are not determinative, as they must be considered overall in the context of the child's best interests. Children do not have a right to determine their living arrangements. The court makes that determination with reference to their best interests. In some cases those interests are best served by acceding to the child's wishes, but in each case the case will turn on its particular facts.
- [26] Importantly, some authorities expressly provide less weight should be given to a child's view in high conflict cases. In L.E.G. v. A.G., 2002 BCSC 1455 Justice Martinson identified 'heated' separation as a parental influence, whether conscious or unconscious, which decreases the reliability of the child's expressed views. See also: J.D.C. v. M.A.K., 2015 BCSC 226 at para. 278.
- [27] Very recently, in L.K.D. v. M.A.K., 2015 BCSC 226 Justice Harvey did not accede to the wishes of 17 and 15 year old children who wanted no involvement with their mother. He explained he had no confidence their views were freely formed

given the father had alienated them from the mother. Justice Harvey ordered them removed from the father and placed in the interim sole custody of the mother along with intensive therapeutic intervention that granted the service provider with the authority to determine the parenting schedule over six months.

## Isaac's Views

- [28] The claimant asserts that Isaac has repeatedly asked to live with him since 2008 and that he encouraged Isaac to remain with his mother until he was 12. According to the claimant, he and the respondent agreed both boys would have a say about where they wanted to live once they reached the age of 13. Isaac turned 12 in 2012. The claimant states since then he has tried to communicate with the respondent about Isaac's desire to live with him.
- [29] The claimant says Isaac has given several reasons why moving to Saskatchewan would be good for him. He identifies the claimant as his role model and mentor. He enjoys the quiet lifestyle of the claimant and his wife and the absence of fighting and arguing in the home. He feels there would be better support for him with his schooling and expresses how important his education is to him. The claimant described Isaac as extremely serious about his future. According to the claimant, Isaac has said he has a better chance of success with the claimant than with the respondent.
- [30] The respondent acknowledges that over the last several years Isaac has mentioned an interest in living with the claimant, but he has never been able to tell her why. The respondent also deposes that shortly before the hearing Isaac announced at a dinner with extended family he was happy not to move to Saskatchewan this past summer. She also indicates she has told Isaac when he is 16 she is prepared to discuss the issue of moving with him. She is concerned he is not yet able to assess his long-term best interests, particularly given his educational challenges.
- [31] To some extent the parties dispute Isaac's level of maturity. I am satisfied he is no more or less mature than other boys his age.

[32] The respondent submits the claimant and his wife have inappropriately involved Isaac in the court process and led him to believe he has the power to decide where he lives.

[33] When Isaac visited the claimant this past summer the claimant arranged for him to be interviewed by a registered psychologist. The report of Sheila Bellrose specifies the claimant contacted her seeking an objective letter stating Isaac's present views. She describes the request as novel, explaining she has no prior experience in eliciting or quoting a child's views. According to Ms. Bellrose, the claimant informed her Isaac had stated he wished to live with him. Ms. Bellrose writes that she met with Isaac, the claimant, and his wife for 90 minutes and then met with Isaac alone for 45 minutes. She comments she observed no undue influence or pressure during the joint meeting. Isaac informed her he has been asking to live with his father for about four or five years. He reported his mother has encouraged him to postpone the move until he is older. Isaac provided some information to Ms. Bellrose about his academic struggles. When asked about rules at home, he identified a number of rules at his mother's home and was not able to identify any at his father's, describing greater freedom there such as biking without restrictions and use of a cell phone, which his mother will not allow until he is older. He denied any current feelings of anger toward his mother, stepfather, or siblings and said he would maintain regular contact with them by phone and visits should he live with his father. Isaac signed a letter prepared by Ms. Bellrose acknowledging it accurately reflects his views.

[34] While I accept that Isaac has expressed for some time a wish to live with the claimant, based on the evidence before me I am concerned about the influence of various factors on his views. With respect to the reliability of his views as recorded by Ms. Bellrose, although she saw nothing that concerned her, I note the claimant and his wife were present for most of the meeting she had with Isaac. It is not clear from the report itself whether Isaac expressed the views he did when he was alone with Ms. Bellrose.

- [35] There is no indication Ms. Bellrose was advised by the claimant the parties share joint guardianship. Certainly the respondent was not informed the report was being prepared. While the claimant complains the respondent has breached his rights as a joint guardian in the past by not seeking his consent when she should have, here his breach occurred in relation to the production of evidence to support an application for an order from this court.
- [36] The chambers materials include written communications between Janna and Isaac. Much of it is secretive and, in my view, undermining of Isaac's relationship with the respondent. On October 2, 2015, Isaac e-mailed Janna apparently in response to a message from her:

Hey, mom, it's me and no, Nadine doesn't know about Facebook. I'm trying to use it when mom is not around the me or when she's out of the house, but yeah, time to time I'll be on Facebook.

Janna responds:

You know she has access to your e-mail, right?

Isaac then says:

I never gave mom my password for this e-mail.

Janna then states:

Well, she has it because she was able to access your e-mail to show that we have talked to you about what's going on with the whole custody issue.

Ultimately, Isaac writes:

Okay. I'll just keep my head up and hope for the best.

- [37] In addition to involving Isaac in the application by, for example, informing him their lawyer had not heard from 'Nadine,', or a lawyer on her behalf and asking whether he knows if she plans to go to court, Janna refers to herself as mom and the respondent as 'nadine' when she corresponds with Isaac.
- [38] Much earlier in 2014 Janna sent Isaac an e-mail asking him to reply to multiple questions about his wishes. The questions ranged from why do you want to live with us to has your mother or anyone else ever asked you if you want to live with us. She encourages him to provide as much detail as possible in his answers. At the

same time, she writes she and the claimant will understand if he has changed his mind and they just want him to be happy.

[39] The e-mail communication between Janna, the claimant, and the respondent is entirely consistent with the approach Janna takes with Isaac. Janna is hostile, critical, and/or disrespectful toward the respondent in many of their communications, which sometimes include the claimant. An exchange related to organizing a visit during the summer of 2014 provides a very small example. Janna was insisting Isaac and Jacob be dropped off at 9:00 in the morning after returning from a holiday the night before with the respondent. The respondent was suggesting 11:00 a.m., for a number of reasons, including the needs of her youngest child. Janna writes:  'We want our boys at 9:00 a.m. to attend …', et cetera, and then further on she writes:

It is really none of our concern about your 'baby's schedule.' We have already given up five days of our mandated summer access to suit your schedule.

[40] Leaving aside the erroneous assumption that she, as well as the claimant, have court ordered access, her aggressive tone is troubling. I was left with the clear impression that Isaac has been subjected to influence by the claimant and his wife. Without suggesting they pressured him to hold and express the view he wants to live with them, I am concerned, he has been impacted by the negative attitude of Janna, in particular, and the claimant toward the respondent when communicating with Isaac.

[41] I am also concerned this influence may have been compounded by the fact the claimant has only exercised parenting time once a year. Isaac's views and wishes may well reflect an underlying desire to spend more time with the claimant and a belief that his choices are to see the claimant once a year or to live with him full time.

[42] As a result, although I respect Isaac's stated views and regard them as worthy of important consideration, I am affording them less weight than I would in

the absence of the influence I have outlined and if the claimant's consistent involvement with him had been greater.

## Other Best Interest Factors

[43] Applying the remaining Gordon principles, I turn to consider the existing custody arrangement and the relationship between Isaac and the respondent, as well as the rest of his family here. As indicated above, despite the complaints of both parties I am not concerned about the care Isaac receives in either home. With respect to the respondent, Isaac has complained to the claimant he has to babysit his little brother too much, he is burdened with chores, his older brother is not, and is sometimes left out when the rest of the family goes shopping. According to the claimant, he has apparently also complained that the respondent ignores his preferences and objections regarding extracurricular activities.

[44] The respondent has provided reasonable responses to these complaints that accord with common sense and the probabilities affecting the case. I accept her evidence that when Isaac does babysit, for example, which is not often, it is because he wants to do so and he enjoys the experience. His responsibilities at home are age appropriate and he is not emotionally or otherwise neglected.

[45] The claimant's evidence regarding the extent of Jacob's aggression and anger toward Isaac is somewhat at odds with his own entirely appropriate response to Jacob earlier in the year when he e-mailed the claimant about a particular dispute. The claimant attempted to reassure Jacob and suggested the problem sounded like sibling rivalry. He shared with Jacob that he, too, disliked his sister when he was growing up but now they are best friends.

[46] The claimant also expresses concern about the respondent's failure to ensure Isaac completes his school work. School records indicate Isaac had many missing assignments in the previous school year. Isaac and Jacob meet with a tutor at home twice a week. The respondent deposes that in addition both she and her spouse spend significant amounts of time helping Isaac. According to the respondent, Isaac will do homework and then forget to take it to school. She says he is constantly

reminded to both bring homework home so they can help him and to return it to school. Her evidence on these points is uncontradicted. Bearing in mind his regular attendance at learning assistance, and the extra time he receives in class to complete assignments as well, I conclude the problem is not one rooted in a parenting deficiency but is likely related to his learning difficulties.

- [47] The respondent describes Isaac as happy in his current life. She says he has a good and open relationship with her and her spouse and he gets along well with his little brother. With respect to Jacob, she says Isaac has and will come to her and her spouse to discuss difficulties he may be having. Nothing in the claimant's evidence causes me to doubt the accuracy of the respondent's account.
- [48] Similarly, I accept what the claimant says about the positive relationship he and his wife share with Isaac. I have no doubt he really enjoys and benefits from the time he has spent with him each summer. I am not surprised Isaac could not recall any rules at the claimant's home when he met with Ms. Bellrose given that visits with the claimant have only occurred for about one month each summer.
- [49] The evidence regarding the amount of time the claimant has spent with Isaac over these last several years, however, causes me to question the depth of his commitment to parenting Isaac full time over the long term. His very brief explanation that he could not afford more frequent visits is not convincing given his income. In addition to visits every other Christmas, every school spring break commencing in 2009, the 2008 order also provides the claimant with access in B.C. upon 48 hours' notice and unrestricted telephone access. There is no evidence to suggest the claimant has sought to visit here over the years in addition to the visits provided by the order.
- [50] There is significant conflict in the parties' evidence about the claimant's efforts to have telephone contact with the boys. The claimant says he tried to call repeatedly for years but was thwarted by the respondent, which she denies, stating the claimant rarely calls. The claimant also deposes the respondent has not permitted Isaac to use Skype and/or Facebook to communicate with him. The

respondent says she has no objection to Skype and, in fact, the two have been in contact through Skype in the past.

[51] I prefer the respondent's evidence on this issue because the claimant's other complaint about the respondent's unwillingness to talk to him by phone in the early years is contradicted by his own e-mail communication. In July 2008 the claimant wrote the respondent the following:

In March of this year I stated very explicitly that I would NOT … In capital letters.

… converse with you via telephone as everything said is hearsay or conjecture.

Further on he writes:

The only time I want to talk to you directly on the phone is if Jacob or Isaac is in the hospital.

[52] In any event, the end result is the claimant has not spent nearly as much time as he could have with Isaac in person and their contact by phone or other electronic means has not been frequent or consistent.

[53] The Gordon factors include the desirability of maintaining contact between the child and both parents. Clearly, it is in Isaac's best interest to maintain contact with both his parents. I have no difficulty concluding it would have been better for Isaac to have had more frequent access with the claimant.

[54] With respect to the disruption to Isaac that would be involved in changing his residence, there is no dispute his entire extended family as well as immediate family, apart from the claimant and his wife, live in the Lower Mainland. He spends time with his extended family regularly.

[55] As outlined above, Isaac receives significant support and assistance at school for his educational needs guided by his individual education plan and psychoeducational assessments. The IEP is tailored to address various learning issues. It includes specific objectives, a variety of strategies that require the

involvement of not only learning assistance teachers but also those in the regular classroom.

- [56] Although the claimant acknowledges that Isaac has some learning difficulties he does not seem to be well informed about them, blaming the respondent and/or the school for not providing him with information. His evidence as to how Isaac's educational needs would be met were he permitted to move is limited. In his second affidavit the claimant says Isaac would attend the Assiniboia Composite High School. He has made inquiries and Isaac can be enrolled there. He also says tutoring would be arranged. In his third affidavit the claimant deposes further that he has been advised by the school principal if Isaac moves to Saskatchewan his current school files would be sent and an assessment would be done to determine his special educational needs. It is not clear why a further assessment would be required or how long that process might take. Significantly, there is no evidence about what supports and services the school presently offers to students with special educational needs and whether it can accommodate a child with Isaac's learning profile based on the existing assessment and IEP.
- [57] Isaac is now well into his grade 10 year. Even without learning issues and leaving aside the impact on his family relationships and friendships, moving him midyear would be highly disruptive. Given those issues and the state of the evidence I am unable to find the identified high school will be able to meet his educational needs.
- [58] In addressing the question of how Isaac would remain in contact with the respondent and other family members if he were to move, the claimant proposes that the respondent have parenting time with Isaac at Christmas , spring break and for one month each summer, as well as contact by electronic means. On her income of approximately $21,000 per year it is clear she would be unable to afford the cost of flying Isaac from Saskatchewan. I expect Isaac is not aware of the limitations posed by the respondent's financial circumstances on his intention to maintain

regular contact with her his stepfather, and his siblings. The absence of in-person contact would not be good for Isaac's emotional and psychological well-being.

## Conclusion

[59] Accordingly, after engaging in an inquiry that has considered all of the circumstances relevant to Isaac's best interests I conclude, despite his stated wish to reside with the claimant it is not in his best interests to do so at this time. I have reached this conclusion without presuming in any way the status quo offers what is best for Isaac.

[60] In the event the claimant is able to provide properly obtained, reliable, objective evidence of Isaac's views, direct evidence of a reasonable and fully informed educational plan, and a workable proposal for access to the respondent, I grant leave to the claimant to re-apply to change Isaac's residence after Isaac reaches the age of 16. Should the claimant choose to do so again I strongly encourage the parties to first seek to resolve the matter by way of mediation.

- [61] In the meantime, I urge the claimant to exercise all of the access provided to him by the 2008 order. I also urge him to exercise his role as a joint guardian by taking a more active role in educational planning for Isaac. I certainly hope the claimant's future communications with the respondent will be far more constructive.

[62] I strongly suggest that Janna cease communicating with the respondent about the children until such time as the parties' co-parenting relationship is on a much more positive footing and that any communication she has with Isaac respects the respondent's role as his mother and their relationship.

[63] I also wish Isaac to be informed that I am available to meet with him to discuss this decision. If so arrangements can be made through scheduling.

- [64] Accordingly, the claimant's application is dismissed.
- [65] THE COURT:  Oh, I believe we have some - is there anything else?

- [66] MS. GRADLEY:  Costs, My Lady.
- [67] [SUBMISSIONS RE: COSTS]
- [68] THE COURT:  Right. The usual rule is that costs follow the event. And the respondent has very clearly been the substantially successful party here and so she will have her costs.
- [69] MS. GRADLEY:  My Lady, to avoid the parties having to potentially incur the costs to return to court I'd ask if the costs could be set forthwith. The tariff provides for $1,000 for each half day on a contested application. We were here for the full day before Your Ladyship. Plus an allowance for taxes and disbursements. So that would be $2,000 plus the 12 per cent taxes, which would be 240, and some disbursements for agent's filling fees and so forth. So that would be 2,240 plus the disbursements. I would suggest if it could be fixed in the sum of $2,300 and that would save us any further discussion or, God forbid, return to court before the Registrar.
- [70] THE COURT:  That does sound reasonable to me. The tariff is pretty clear.
- [71] MS. KOVACS:  If you're ordering the costs, My Lady, I would rather not see the parties wasting another three or four hours on that because that's going to total to that amount anyways.
- [72] THE COURT:  All right. So, I will fix those costs based on a full day in chambers, taxes and disbursements, at $2,300.
