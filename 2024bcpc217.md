## Introduction

- [1] This Application about a Family Law Matter (the 'Application') arises out of the dissolution of a relationship between the Applicant, R.E., and the Respondent, A.S. At issue in this case is the guardianship, parenting responsibilities and parenting time surrounding the two children of the relationship, M.S.E., presently aged 11, and G.S.E., presently aged 7 (the 'Children'). R.E. is the biological father of the two children with whom they lived with since birth, and, accordingly, is a presumptive guardian pursuant to s. 39(1) of the Family Law Act , S.C.B. 2011 c. 25 (the 'Act ').
- [2] The parties separated in June 2022, following an incident between them where it is alleged family violence occurred. Since the date of separation, R.E. has not seen his children in person, but has had irregular video calls with them pursuant to an interim order made by the Honourable Judge Boblin on October 24, 2022 (the 'Boblin Order'). The video calls have been inconsistently scheduled, with several cancelled and not rescheduled owing to illness on the part of a child, A.S. or the supervisor chosen by A.S. R.E. has not had supervised in person parenting time despite the interim order of the Honourable Judge Brown dated November 28, 2022 (the 'Brown Order'), as, he says, A.S. did not cooperate with engaging with the professional agencies he reached out to in order to set it up. R.E. seeks that the court order he be permitted unsupervised parenting time with the Children, including overnight parenting time every second weekend and on alternating holidays. Initially he brought a claim to reduce his child support obligations on the basis of undue hardship, but during the trial, he abandoned that claim. He states that he is willing and able to pay the child support his children are owed.
- [3] In her filed reply to the Application, A.S. did not want R.E. to have any contact with the children. Her position was that R.E. was not capable of caring for, or parenting the Children, and has never been a caregiver of the Children, nor ensured their wellbeing. She wanted all of the parenting responsibilities and noted that she, alone, made sure that the children's physical and mental well-being needs were met. She cited M.S.E.'s diabetes and G.S.E.'s speech delay as supporting her claim for sole parenting

responsibilities. She also alleged that R.E. assaulted her in front of the Children, and R.E.'s older son, L.E., sexually touched M.S.E. She says that R.E. is not capable of protecting his children because he denies that the sexual touching occurred. If the court was to order parenting time, A.S. said that the parenting time should be supervised by a professional agency, such as the Ann Davis Society. At trial, A.S.'s position somewhat softened. She submitted that she wanted the Children to have a relationship with their father; however, was concerned about the risk L.E. posed to the Children and did not want L.E. around if parenting time was to occur. She maintained her position that parenting time should be supervised and, as it relates to M.S.E., any parenting time should be subject to M.S.E.'s wishes. She acknowledged that she and R.E. would share parenting responsibilities; however, in the event of a dispute, she wanted the final say.

- [4] The parties called several witnesses at trial to support their positions. In addition to himself, R.E. called his mother D.E. In addition to herself, A.S. called two parenting supervisors - S.K. and S.D., as well as her father R.S. I have carefully considered all of the evidence put before me, but will only reference the evidence of a particular witness, if I find necessary to do so in these reasons. The court also had the benefit of a Section 211 Views of the Child Report prepared in May 2023, by a Family Justice Counsellor (the 's. 211 Report') which was received into evidence, as well as the sworn financial statements of both parties.
- [5] The task for this Court is to determine what parenting arrangements are in the best interests of the Children, and to craft an order that protects, to the greatest extent possible, the physical, psychological, and emotional safety, security and well-being of the Children.

## Factual Background

- [6] The parties were in a common law relationship, residing in the Chilliwack area, for approximately 10 years prior to its dissolution in June 2022. A.S. previously worked with R.E.'s mother as a care aid and was eventually introduced to R.E. in 2008.The parties commenced a relationship in 2011. At or near the time the parties commenced their relationship, R.E. had recently come out of a relationship with another woman, and

had an infant child named L.E. R.E. shared parenting responsibilities for L.E. with L.E.'s mother. A.S. was in the third trimester of her pregnancy with her eldest son, R.S. R.S.'s biological father was not involved in his life from birth.

- [7] As a result of their relationship, the parties had two children; first their daughter M.S.E. in [omitted for publication], and then their son G.S.E.in [omitted for publication]. The parties had no other children together.

## A.  The Children - M.S.E. and G.S.E.

- [8] M.S.E. is presently 11 years old and attends school middle school. I am told she is mature, resilient, 'wise beyond her years,' and is protective of those she loves. She is close with her mother and has been described as a thoughtful, kind and intuitive young woman. She enjoys art class in school the most and would like to participate in gymnastics. She has several friends, and likes to spend her free time colouring. I am told that recently, she has become very interested in cooking and she and her mother spend time preparing meals together. M.S.E.'s view of her family includes her mother, father, brothers (G.S.E., R.S. and L.E.), along with her extended family on her maternal and paternal side. It is apparent from the s. 211 Report that M.S.E. has aligned herself with her mother and she does not want contact with L.E. or her father at the present time. She does not want to see L.E. because he hurt her in the past. Because she witnessed an incident of family violence that precipitated the separation of her parents, M.S.E. fears that her father may hurt her brother G.S.E. if he spends time with him. She found the incident scary and upsetting. Prior to the separation, M.S.E. had a good relationship with both her father and her mother. She told the s. 211 Report writer that her father has never hurt her.
- [9] G.S.E. is presently 7 years old and attends elementary school. He has been described as 'goofy' by nature, imaginative and a little boy who loves social interaction and to likes play with his toys. At the time the s. 211 Report was authored, he enjoyed reading the Pete the Cat series. He enjoys playing video games, is interested in hockey and enjoys physical education at school. He has a close relationship with his mother and his father. I am told he requires speech therapy to assist him and that A.S. has

made arrangements for that therapy. G.S.E. has not seen his father in person since the dissolution of the relationship in June 2022. He told the author of the s. 211 Report that he wants to see his father, wants to go to his house and misses him 'so much.' He expressed being mad that he cannot see his dad at times and that, in turn, makes him mad at his mother and his sister. He worries he will hurt his sister's feelings if he sees his father, as he knows that will upset her. Prior to the dissolution of the relationship, G.S.E. had a good relationship with both parents; however, was very close to his father.

## B.  The Relationship of the Parties

- [10] The parties described a tumultuous relationship that involved at least two periods where they lived separate and apart before reuniting. This included a period of time in 2015, where they separated because of differences, and a time in 2018 when A.S. left the family home to attend a residential treatment facility to address her addiction to pain pills. While A.S. was living in the residential treatment facility, the children lived with R.E. and his mother D.E, and R.E. was the primary caregiver. R.E. brought the children to visit A.S. while she was in the residential treatment program.
- [11] The parties consistently described the relationship as one that regularly involved fighting in front of their children. A.S. described the relationship as stressful right from the beginning. R.E. described his frustration with always having to be the parent that was responsible for disciplining the children. Both parties described life circumstances in the family home that can best be equated to a stress filled pressure cooker. Both parties acknowledged that their interactions with each other were not healthy and they did not think about the impact these interactions were having on the children at the time. It appears from the evidence of both R.E. and A.S. that the stressors in the home revolved around the impact that each party's eldest child had on the relationship and the dynamics in the family home, along with the impact of the other party's parent(s).
- [12] The description of the children - R.S. and L.E. - leads me to conclude that neither child is neurotypical and each required, and still requires, significant attention and care from their parents. R.S. was described as being diagnosed with autism and has significant behavioural challenges that involve him violently lashing out towards his

mother and towards property within the home to the extent that the other children need to be removed from whatever location he is in. He does not have a regular school schedule and is presently engaged in counselling therapy. L.E.'s neurodiversity appears to manifest complex behavioural and sensory issues which included inappropriate touching, and a lack impulse control. From the evidence put before me, I can conclude that neither party saw eye to eye on how to parent these children, which, in combination with the myriad of other stressors built into this relationship, lead to the creation of a high stress and a toxic home environment.

- [13] A.S. advised the court that when she finished her residential treatment, she believed her relationship with R.E. was over. Rather than relocate, she returned to the family home and the relationship remained strained. She remained in the family home until June 2022.

## C.  M.S.E.'s Diabetes and Violation of her Bodily Integrity

- [14] In 2018, the Ministry of Children and Family Development (MCFD) became involved after it was alleged that L.E. touched M.S.E. inappropriately and in a manner that violated her bodily integrity. This allegation appears to have come to light concurrently (or very near the time) when M.S.E. was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes and a doctor noticed some atypical evidence in and around M.S.E.'s vaginal area. I am told that at the same time M.S.E. was suffering from a severe nut allergy and sensitive skin condition.
- [15] A.S.'s position is that L.E., then approximately 7 years old, penetrated M.S.E. while touching her in a sexual manner. R.E. is not convinced that L.E. penetrated his daughter, testifying that he pressed his son to the point of tears who confessed to him that he did touch his sister inappropriately, but denied ever penetrating her vagina. It is unnecessary for me to resolve the extent of this touching, as I am satisfied that L.E. did touch M.S.E. in some way that gave rise to M.S.E.'s bodily and sexual integrity being compromised. The resulting impact of that touching not only wounded the dignity of M.S.E., but may have resulted in a profound and long term impact on her emotional wellbeing. However, while I need not resolve the extent of the touching to decide this

case, I do find that the differing positions of the parties as to L.E.'s culpability in the touching of M.S.E. coupled with their differing views on the sufficiency of R.E.'s response to the harm inexorably lead to increased tension and volatility in the relationship.

- [16] As a result of MCFD's involvement in 2018, the family was provided services and recommended additional supports. In 2021, social workers provided referrals to a Sexual Abuse Intervention Program (SAIP) and counselling for M.S.E. I was provided evidence that M.S.E. engaged in counselling to help her process the trauma associated with being a victim of sexual violence. The parties advise that MCFD is no longer involved in their family. The s. 211 Report confirms that MCFD has no open child protection concerns for either parent.
- [17] I am also satisfied from the evidence before me that whatever touching occurred, it was done so by a child with complex needs and developmental disabilities. I am also satisfied that appropriate interventions were put in place by L.E.' parents, and he has been engaged with professionals and continues to be involved in supports and interventions that include professional oversight, physical activity and equestrian therapy designed to advance his neurological development and mitigate any risk he poses to others. I am told by R.E. that he has received confirmation from the professionals involved in L.E.'s treatment that his risk for future sexualized touching is diminished, if not non-existent. I accept his evidence on this point. While I find that L.E. does not present as an undue risk to M.S.E. or G.S.E., I am also not prepared to conclude that exposing M.S.E. to L.E., without her express willingness and consent, would not have a detrimental psychological impact on her. The importance of this finding will become apparent when it comes to the order I am going to make in this case.
- [18] In her direct evidence, A.S. made additional allegations about L.E. inappropriately engaging with the other siblings, including directing them into a room to take their clothing off, or touching them. Her evidence on these points was vague and, at times inconsistent, and I find was designed to cast L.E. in a worse light than

necessary in order to support a theory that L.E. poses an undue risk to the Children. I do not accept this evidence nor do I put any weight on these allegations.

## D.  R.S.'s Behavioural Needs

- [19] The evidence tells me that R.S. is a highly intelligent child and his mother plays a central stabilizing support in his life. The evidence also suggests that R.S. had a close relationship with R.E. until approximately August 2020, when an incident occurred between R.S. and his mother, and where R.E. attempted to intervene. The parties differ on their recounting of this incident. A.S. alleges that R.E. assaulted R.S. and threatened to throw him down the stairs after R.S. hit her in the face with a toy. R.E. denies this. He says he came home to chaos and screaming, saw that R.S. had struck A.S. very hard in the eye and he separated R.S. from the situation. R.E. admits that when A.S. tried to come between himself and R.S. he put his arm out and she fell and may have hit her head. He denies intentionally assaulting her. Both parties agree this incident unfolded in front of M.S.E. and G.S.E.
- [20] For the purposes of the Application, I do not need to resolve which version of events is true. What I am prepared to find, on the basis of the evidence before me, is that M.S.E. and G.S.E. were exposed to a complete unravelling of control on the part of both parents in relation to the difficult challenges they faced as a result of R.S.'s behavioural complexities. I find that the Children were exposed to violence upon their mother by their brother and that the Children were exposed to their father yelling and physically removing their brother in a manner that was scary. Simultaneously, the Children observed their mother either accidentally or intentionally becoming injured. I need not find an intent to harm in order to find family violence in this case. I also accept the evidence of A.S., that as a result of that incident, R.S.'s relationship with R.E. was adversely impacted.
- [21] Like L.E., I am prepared to accept that at present, R.S.'s behavioural complexities are being adequately managed and that, while I am told he still has violent outbursts, A.S. has a system in place that protects the Children from any physical or psychological harm that may flow from these outbursts. I accept A.S.'s evidence that

R.S. is 'much better now', and I find that he does not pose an undue risk of physical or psychological violence to M.S.E. and G.S.E.

## E.  Dissolution of the Relationship

- [22] After the incident involving the sexual touching of M.S.E. and the August 2020 incident with R.S., it is clear that any semblance of harmony that did exist, no longer existed in the family home. I am told, and I accept, that both A.S. and R.E. fought regularly about the impact the presence their older child had within the home. I am told that when R.E. had L.E., he would spend time with L.E. at his mother's home, returning to the family home at night to put G.S.E.to bed and for him to sleep. While he believed he was still living in the family home at that time, A.S.'s view was that he was no longer living with her and the Children, he was just there. Again, I need not resolve the extent to which R.E. 'lived' with the family, but I highlight this disagreement as it is an example of the complete discord between the viewpoints of the parties near the end of their time together. This discord continues through today.
- [23] In June 2022, an incident occurred that resulted in A.S. making the decision to leave the family home. On that day, A.S. woke up to R.E. yelling at her because the house was a mess. She described that the house was in fact a mess - there were 2 cats, 5 kittens and 'kitty litter everywhere.' She said the couple were not on good terms and because of a previous incident, she decided to record him. A.S. said that while R.E. was outside lighting a cigarette for the two of them she approached him and he saw that she was recording. She said he called her crazy and then hit the phone out of her hand and threw it. A.S. said she attached herself to the doorframe, and when he tried to come back into the house, she was struck with the door and she screamed for help. M.S.E. witnessed this incident and was scared. A.S. told the kids to run and call the police. R.S. ran outside and told the neighbours that his mom was murdered. A.S. testified that R.S. makes up stories; however, what I infer from this is that while she was not actually murdered, R.S. was scared that his mother was harmed.
- [24] R.E.'s version of this incident generally accords with what was described, except he denies breaking A.S.'s phone and intentionally assaulting her. I am advised that

police attended and no charges were pursued by the Crown, nor was R.E. placed on any form of release order or police issued undertaking.

[25] Following the incident, R.E. left the home for the day and went to work. A.S. retained movers and moved her and the children out of the family home. R.E. advised the court that he learned of the move while at work when a neighbour called him, asking if he was moving - a call that caught him off guard. This was the last day the children saw their father in person.

- [26] A.S. testified that she feared R.E. as a result of his actions during the June 2022 incident, and today, she remains uncomfortable with him coming to her home. I also accept M.S.E.'s evidence, as contained in the s. 211 Report, that her dad has not hurt her, but scares her, and that the entire incident was scary and upsetting for her.

## F.  Alleged Abusive Behaviour towards the Children

[27] In her testimony, A.S. also testified that R.E. was physically abusive towards the children, particularly R.S. and L.E., and that M.S.E. and G.S.E. witnessed this. She briefly described a violent event where she said L.E. was taken into a room and she heard him crying and R.E. hitting him. She then told the court she heard R.E. talking on the phone with his mother D.E. and she overheard D.E. tell R.E. that she put Polysporin on the bruise to cover it up and that R.E. better hope it be gone in the morning.

[28] R.E. denied ever abusing his children and this specific event was never put to him or his mother in cross-examination by A.S.'s counsel. He admitted to using corporal punishment and 'swatting' the children on their bottoms in order to correct behaviour, but denied ever beating the children. I do not accept A.S.'s evidence as it relates to allegations of physical violence that R.E. inflicted upon his children. It is inconsistent with G.S.E.'s views of his father as detailed in the s. 211 Report, M.S.E.'s evidence in the s. 211 Report that he has never hurt her, D.E.'s evidence about R.E.'s positive interactions as a father with the children prior to separation and even, at times, A.S.'s own evidence about R.E.'s relationship with his children.

[29] Physically abusing and threatening a child is serious parental misconduct that undermines the safety and wellbeing of children and their emotional and physical development. It perverts the bond the child has with the parent and the family unit and is a profound breach of trust. Children need to be protected from abusive treatment as they are incredibly vulnerable and deserve to be in a safe and healthy environment where they are loved, guided and protected by their parents. At the same time, children depend on their parents for guidance and discipline to protect them from harm and promote their healthy development within society: Canadian Foundation for Children, Youth and the Law v. Canada (Attorney General) , 2004 SCC 4 at para. 58. Not all physical punishment will amount to physical abuse. Removing a child from a volatile situation, even forcibly, does not automatically amount to physical abuse.

[30] R.E. was asked in cross-examination to describe what discipline meant to him along with his approach. I accept his evidence on this point. I accept that his view of discipline does not offend what is legally permissible. I accept that he aligns his views of discipline as tying a consequence to behaviour in order to correct and teach the child. In cross-examination, he gave an example where misbehaviour by the child resulted in the child losing privileges on a computer, doing a special activity or spending time with friends. His answers were measured and tied meaningful consequences to timely intervention for the child. He admitted that while he was in the relationship with A.S., he became frustrated with his default position as the family disciplinarian because it placed him in a different position than A.S. where he was seen as the strict one. I accept this evidence.

[31] From the evidence I do accept, I find that R.E. does not present any risk for physical or psychological harm to his children. I find that he is a safe, loving parent that is capable of meeting all the needs of his children and acting in his children's best interests.

## G. Post Separation Communication and Contact

[32] Following the separation, R.E. and A.S. had minimal, if any, contact and communication. R.E. did not know where A.S. was living with the children, nor did the

children have an opportunity to speak with him. A.S. testified that in the early days of the separation, G.S.E. would cry and express a desire to be with his father and she would try and console him by telling him that one day 'someone will decide when you can see your dad, I can't do that.'

[33] R.E. filed the Application in August 2022. A.S. did not file her reply until January 2023. No counterapplication was ever filed by A.S.

[34] In October 2022, a family management conference was held wherein R.E. was granted video visits with his children while efforts were made to address potential in person supervised visits pursuant to the Boblin Order. By this point, the Children had not seen or heard from their father for nearly four months. I accept that having no contact or communication with R.E. for four months amounted to a substantial disruption in what the Children were used to in terms of time with their father, as I accept that R.E. was an active and involved parent up to the point of separation, even with the tension that had existed in the home.

[35] I am told that video visits commenced in November 2022, when A.S. found a person, Ms. D, whom she felt safe with and comfortable supervising the video visits. I note, parenthetically, that the order did not require the video calls to be supervised and Judge Boblin told the parties that no risk of harm would come from the video visits during the discussions at the family management conference. A.S. testified at trial that she wanted the video calls supervised because she 'felt there was a lot of manipulating and gas lighting…calls should be focused on how are you, what are you enjoying right now, not what did you have for dinner.' In my view, this perspective ignores the difficulties inherent in the circumstances R.E. was in and where he was limited in the form of communication he was permitted to have with the Children.

[36] Both parties repeatedly testified that they do not communicate with each other. A.S. testified that she feared R.E. because of the incident that resulted in her leaving the home. R.E. testified that he has tried to get information about the children from her and she refuses to communicate with him save and except for rare occasions. On November 28, 2022, the Honourable Judge Brown ordered that in addition to the video

calls, the children were allowed to have supervised visits with R.E., supervised by the Ann Davis Society or such other supervisor as agreed upon at times and dates agreed upon by the parties. Those supervised visits never occurred.

[37] R.E. testified that after receiving the Brown Order, he went to the Ann Davis Society to try and engage a person to supervise his visits. He was given a list of names and started calling people. In one instance he was told there would be a lengthy wait of over a year to get a supervised visit. On at least two occasions he found people willing to supervise, however, he was advised that they needed to confirm A.S.'s acceptance first. He gave each potential supervisor A.S.'s contact information and was told that she never responded to their calls or messages. This evidence went unchallenged. I find as a fact that A.S. did not engage with these potential supervisors, the practical impact being that she frustrated a court order and the children were denied their ability to see their father in person.

[38] R.E. testified that he did not take steps to enforce the Brown Order as he was hoping the matters would be resolved by the next court appearance and his 'head was everywhere' as he feared losing any potential access to his children by creating further conflict with A.S. While it was unfortunate that he did not obtain legal advice and instead acquiesced to what was an intolerable situation, I accept his explanation and do not find him guilty of any laches or misconduct in not pursuing his supervised parenting time with his children. R.E. has substantially complied with all of the legal steps required of him, from taking the prescribed parenting course, to filing the Application, to participating in the family management conferences to complying with the terms of the Boblin Order which required he commence making regular child support payments. I accept that finances are limited in both households and the cost of legal applications poses a substantial barrier for both parties. I also accept that both parties would prefer to use their money to support their children, as opposed to paying lawyers and legal fees.

## H.  Parents' Efforts Post Separation

- [39] I heard compelling evidence from both parties about their efforts since separation to improve their personal situations for the sake of their children. Each of them should be commended for doing what they have done. To me, this demonstrates remarkable insight into themselves, but also shows me how they are each parents who are capable of modelling positive behaviours for their children and willing to improve their own abilities to provide a level of care for their children that is positive, safe and healthy.
- [40] A.S. told the court that since separation she has been spending time reacquiring the basic skills she lost through addiction and has engaged herself in counselling. She says she has done a lot of self-help. She has been focusing on learning how to cook and reconnecting with her children and spending time with them in a positive way. Prior to the separation, she found it was very physically and mentally difficult to go outdoors with her kids and so she only spent time with them indoors. Today, she spends time outside with her children engaged in healthy activities such as riding their scooters, kicking a soccer ball and going to the park. She has created a home that has been described as healthy, clean and safe and where the children are free to have their friends over.
- [41] R.E. has taken steps to address his emotional responses and has found supports to better himself as a father and as a person. He has undergone individual counselling, taken anger management and belongs to a peer support group called [omitted for publication]. He is committed to being a better person and father. He engaged himself in all counselling and programming on his own accord, without the requirement of any court order or direction. Despite the toll being separated from the Children took on him and his mental health, he remained active in his son L.E.' life - maintaining an active role in his therapy and volunteering as a coach in the hockey program he belongs to. He has set up a clean, safe home for himself and the Children; a home he co-owns with his mother, D.E. There are toys, sports equipment and video games for the children to play with, while with him. He is close to parks, schools, playgrounds and entertainment.

According to D.E., she and her son 'can provide a good, loving and safe home' for the children. I accept her evidence on this point.

[42] From the evidence I've heard and accept, I am satisfied that both of these parents are capable people who have taken steps to better themselves since their separation in June 2022. I am satisfied that they are both capable of being strong, loving, nurturing and supportive parents to the Children. I am satisfied that both parents are capable of looking out for the best interests of their children and will refrain from exposing them to family violence or any other form of violence or inappropriate conduct or behaviour, and will provide a home environment where the Children will thrive. Both are equally capable parents who the children need in their lives.

## I. Financial Situation of the Parties

[43] R.E. is employed full time with [omitted for publication]. He has been employed with this company for ten years. His line 15000 from his 2023 income tax return is $65,627.67 He declares no other source of income. He also makes monthly child support payments for his son L.E. in the amount of $233.10 bi-weekly.

[44] A.S. is on social assistance. She rents an apartment where she lives with the Children and R.S. Neither of the Children are involved in extracurricular activities. I am told that G.S.E. requires speech therapy, but have no information about the frequency or costs. Her line 15000 from her 2023 income tax return states her income is $19,476. She declares no other source of income.

[45] A.S. requested that R.E.'s child support obligations be retroactively adjusted to correspond to his income as reflected in his 2023 income tax return. No counterclaim was filed by A.S. and no evidence was put before me about any steps she took to alert R.E. that she would make this application. From the evidence I do have, I find that R.E. immediately began paying child support in the amount required by the Boblin Order and at no time did R.E. ever attempt to withhold or avoid his financial obligations to the Children.

## Analysis

- [46] As stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Barendregt v. Grebliunas , 2022 SCC 22 at para 8:
- [8] Determining the best interests of the child is a heavy responsibility, with profound impacts on children, families and society. In many cases, the answer is difficult - the court must choose between competing and often compelling visions of how to best advance the needs and interests of the child.
- [47] To do so in this case, I am guided by sections 37 and 38 of the Act . I am also mindful of s. 40(4) of the Act , insofar that there is no presumption that equal parenting time and the equal sharing of parental responsibilities is what is in the best interests of the Children.
- [48] By the end of the trial, A.S.'s position moved somewhat and she submitted that she was in partial agreement with R.E., particularly as it related to her willingness to share parental responsibilities and information with him. She submitted that she wanted final decision making authority in the event there was a disagreement about parental responsibilities and she also wanted R.E. to share information with her. She recommended the parties communicate by text message.
- [49] She also expressly stated that she wanted the Children to have a relationship with R.E.; however, any order that related to M.S.E. should be subject to M.S.E.'s wishes. R.E. told the court that while he was saddened to hear that M.S.E. did not want to see him, he respects her decision and her autonomy and wanted to make it clear that his home would always be open to her and he would always be present in her life when she was ready and to the extent that she wanted.

[50] As it relates to taking into account M.S.E.'s wishes, I find it is important to do so given her age and level of maturity. M.S.E. is nearly 12 years old and has been described as a mature, thoughtful and intelligent young girl. As is too common in cases such as this, she has aligned herself with one of her parents. At present, she is not interested in a relationship with her father. I am prepared to accept her wishes. I have

heard her wishes, and I feel that to disregard them would not be in her best interests as it would undermine her personal autonomy and risk causing psychological harm to her. Forcing her to engage in a relationship with her father, in my view, would also risk further damaging an already fractured relationship between her and her father. The psychological wounds in this case appear to run deep, and, perhaps after time and distance, and the open door that R.E. professes to make available, those wounds may heal and the relationship may repair itself. It will be R.E.'s actions going forward that will likely drive M.S.E.'s willingness to re-establish any relationship with him.

[51] The stress and trauma visited upon the Children by life in the family home before separation appears to have now evaporated. The toxic relationship of R.E. and A.S. has come to an end. There is no hope of reconciliation. Both parties stated, and I accept, they are now focused on ensuring their children are cared for and loved, and each wants to play an active positive role in the Children's lives. I am satisfied that granting R.E.'s application will not adversely impact the health and emotional well-being of the Children. While they have been physically apart for two years, and with that will come some stress and challenges in adjusting to a new routine, I am satisfied that the Children will be capable of making that adjustment should each parent create the necessary conditions to make that possible. I am satisfied that by improving the information sharing between the parents, and normalizing the relationships the Children have with each parent, the health and emotional wellbeing of the Children can be fostered and protected.

[52] I am also satisfied that granting the application will improve the nature and strength of the relationships between the Children and other significant persons in their lives. Prior to separation, D.E. played an integral role in the family and was a close support to the Children. She testified about the deep bond she had with the Children. R.E. also had a deep bond with the Children, especially G.S.E. Any order I do make should give effect to strengthening those relationships, while at the same time not undermining any existing relationships that have developed while living with A.S. I have heard that friendships and peer relationships have since been established by the Children.

[53] The Children were cared for by both parents prior to separation. While A.S. was a stay at home parent, I am satisfied that both parents were active in the care of the Children and each responsible for and responsive to their needs.

[54] Children need stability, but stability does not necessary mean status quo. Children can be resilient and can adapt to changes in their life as arrangements are made to create a new normal. Once a healthy routine has been established, then that routine needs to be respected, promoted and encouraged by the parents. Given G.S.E.'s age, in my view a structured arrangement that provides him certainty as to when he will be able to see and spend time with his father is in his best interests. As it relates to M.S.E., any parenting time with R.E. must be premised on the precondition that she wants to participate in it. When she does want to participate in it, the nature and extent of her participation should be guided by her wishes. Those wishes need to be hers and hers alone, and not the product of any interference by either parent.

[55] As I have found previously, I am satisfied that both parties are capable of exercising parental responsibilities and parenting time with the children. Both are capable of doing so in a loving and safe manner. In this case, I find that it is in the best interests of the children that both parents play an active and central role in their lives, and both parents are capable of doing so.

[56] Family violence has been alleged in this case, as I have previously made mention to. I am satisfied that while the Children remained in the pressure cooker environment that was the family home before the parties separated, they were exposed to family violence on the part of both their parents. The impact of the family violence on the Children, I accept, was serious. I also accept that the June 2022 incident resulted in A.S. leaving the family home because she was scared of R.E. It was certainly enough to scare M.S.E. and has swayed her opinion of her dad. I also find that at no time was physical violence directed at the Children by R.E. I accept R.E.'s evidence on this point as it is also consistent with the evidence in the s. 211 Report.

[57] As I mentioned earlier, I need not resolve whether the family violence that did exist in the home was intentional or not. However, even if it were intentionally inflicted

by R.E. upon A.S., I am satisfied that he no longer presents a risk of exposing the Children to future violence, or to inflicting violence upon A.S.. He has undergone counselling and programming, has refocused his life into a positive direction and is now squarely focused on providing for and being with his children. I accept his evidence when he says he only wants to be able to communicate with A.S. about the Children and he has no desire to ever reconcile their relationship. I do not find that R.E.'s ability to care for the Children and meet the needs of the Children are impaired to any degree.

[58] In her evidence A.S. testified that she does not own a vehicle and that she walks with the Children or takes public transit. She also told the court she does not feel comfortable with R.E. picking up the Children outside her apartment while she waits with the Children inside the secure lobby. She has suggested that any exchanges of the Children that I do order, should occur at a nearby Shoppers Drug Mart, or at a nearby school. It is her position that other people need to be around while R.E. collects and drops off the Children for her own comfort. Despite my finding that R.E. does not pose a risk of violence to A.S., I appreciate that A.S. may still fear R.E. and is uncomfortable with him coming to her home. Accordingly, I accept that identifying an exchange location where she feels comfortable is in the best interests of the Children.

[59] In my view, the order I intend to impose is one that, to the greatest extent possible, protects the physical, psychological and emotional safety, security and wellbeing of the Children. It will be up to the parents to ensure that their conduct does not result in the Children further experiencing adverse childhood experiences as a result of their actions. As I told the parties in court, the exchange of parenting time must be a happy occasion for the Children. There will be challenges and difficulties in the beginning; however, it is up to R.E. and A.S. to encourage and comfort the Children as they adjust to the new reality of the family. They must put their differences aside and support the other parent in the face of the Children and present a united front. They must dispel any notion that the other parent is unsafe or incapable of being a parent who acts in the child's best interest and they, most certainly, must not use one child to undermine any relationship or wishes of another child. I make this latter point because there was some suggestion in the evidence that should G.S.E. go to his father's home,

M.S.E. would go too - not to visit her dad, but to make sure G.S.E. was safe. Should this transpire and be known to or encouraged by either party, this approach would be completely unacceptable and untenable. To utilize a child as a parental supervisor, would, in my view amount to inflicting psychological harm upon that child and would risk further undermining any relationship that that child, or any other child may have with the parent.

## Order - Guardianship, Parental Responsibilities and Parenting Time

- [60] Having reviewed the evidence and the relevant legal principles, I conclude that I am granting the Application on the following terms. This will be a final order.
- [61] The court is satisfied that R.E. and A.S are the guardians of the children M.S.E. and G.S.E. under s. 39(1) of the Family Law Act .

No party is entitled to stall communications. In the event of an emergency, the parent

exercising parenting time will have decision making authority and will be required to immediately alert the other parent to the nature of the emergency and the location of the child.

[64] Both parties are entitled to be informed of and present for any meeting, doctor's appointment, hospital visit, counselling or therapy session, extra-curricular activity, school event or other similar activity that relates to the Children. While in the same physical presence, R.E. and A.S will ensure they maintain polite communications with each other and will not cause conflict.

[65] Commencing November 1, 2024, and until November 30, 2024, R.E. shall have liberal and generous parenting time with M.S.E. and G.S.E. at dates and times agreed between the parties, but no less than every Tuesday and Thursday between the hours of 5:00pm and 7:30pm and every Saturday between the hours of 9:00am and 7:30pm.

- e.  During the summer school break, for five additional consecutive days in July and five additional consecutive days in August with the dates and times to be agreed between the parties in writing by no later than April 30 of each year. The parties will come to a consensus as to the schedule and will not unduly limit or restrict the apportionment of this additional parenting time;
- f. If the day preceding or following the weekend or commencement of R.E.'s parenting time is a statutory holiday, a school non-instructional day or a school administrative day, R.E.'s parenting time shall include that extra day. If the extra day is preceding the weekend or R.E.'s scheduled parenting time, then R.E.'s parenting time commences at 5:00pm the day before the extra day;
- g.  During any overnight parenting time, the child L.E. may be present, however, must not share a bedroom with the Children, must be supervised by R.E. or another person and must not be left alone with the Children.
- [67] Christmas Day will be shared as follows:
- a. The Children will spend Christmas morning with A.S.
- b. R.E. will have parenting time on Christmas Day from 1:00pm until 7:30pm. The Children will be returned to A.S no later than 7:30pm.
- c. If Christmas Day falls during R.E.'s scheduled parenting time such that at least one day of parenting time follows Christmas Day, then the Children will spend Christmas morning with R.E. and A.S will have parenting time from 1:00pm until 7:30pm. The Children will be returned to R.E. no later than 7:30pm.
- d. If Christmas Day falls on the last day of R.E.'s scheduled parenting time, then the Children will spend Christmas Day with R.E. and will be returned to A.S at 4:00pm.
- [68] Easter, Thanksgiving, or any other significant religious or cultural day that is observed by the family will be shared equally between the parties, as agreed upon in writing by the parties no later than January 15 of each year.
- [69] R.E. will have parenting time with the Children on Father's Day from 9:00am to 7:30pm, regardless of which party has parenting time under the parenting schedule detailed in this order.

[70] A.S will have parenting time with the Children on Mother's Day from 9:00am to 7:30pm, regardless of which party has parenting time under the parenting schedule detailed in this order.

[71] All parenting time relating to M.S.E. is subject to the express wishes of M.S.E.

[72] The Children will reside primarily with A.S and A.S shall have all other parenting time with the Children that is not specified for, or arranged pursuant to this order.

[73] A.S shall not relocate with the Children outside of the Chilliwack area without the express written permission of R.E., or an order of the Court.

[74] A.S will not change her place of residence without informing R.E., in writing, at least 21 days before any move. A.S will provide R.E. with the new residential address when informing R.E. of the move.

[75] While the Children are in the overnight care of a parent, the other parent shall have reasonable telephone and/or video/electronic communication with the Children at least once per day to a maximum of 30 minutes. However, no communication may be had after 8:00pm.

[76] While the Children are in their care, the parent exercising care over and parenting time with the Children shall at all times ensure the Children are not exposed to any form of violence and shall put the Children's emotional, physical and psychological health, safety and security above all else.

[77] R.E. and A.S will transition the Children at the Shoppers Drug Mart located at [omitted for publication], or at such other location as agreed upon in writing at least 24 hours in advance of the transition.

[78] The parent who is exercising parenting time with the Children shall transport the Children to the transition location for the other parent to exercise parenting time with the Children. The parent with the Children must arrive at the transition location with the Children on time.

[79] Neither parent shall unnecessarily withhold parenting time from the other parent. If a child is ill, then A.S must immediately contact R.E. to advise him of this and consult with R.E. as to how he wishes to proceed with his scheduled parenting time. R.E. will have final decision making authority as to whether to cancel or reschedule his parenting time owing to a child's illness.

[80] R.E. and A.S will avoid conflict with one another and will conduct themselves responsibly during any transition of parenting time in order to normalize the transition for the Children and foster a positive experience for the Children.

[81] At all times while with the Children, R.E. and A.S shall put the best interests of the Children before their own interests; encourage the Children to have a good relationship with the other parent and speak to the Children about the other parent in a positive and respectful manner; make a real effort to maintain polite, respectful communications with each other, refraining from any negative or hostile criticism, communication or argument in front of the Children; and, dispel any notion that the other parent is an incapable or unsafe as a parent.

- [82] R.E. and A.S shall not question the Children about the other parent or time spent with the other parent beyond simple conversational questions; discuss with the Children any inappropriate adult, court or legal matters; or blame, criticize or disparage the other parent to the Children.
- [83] R.E. and A.S shall encourage their respective families, friends and associates to refrain from any negative comments about the other parent and his or her family, and from any discussions in front of the Children about the family issues or litigation. Should a parent see this occurring, that parent shall immediately remove the Children from the presence of the person who is engaging in this prohibited conduct.
- [84] R.E. and A.S are encouraged to engage the assistance of a Family Justice Counsellor through the Justice Access Centre to assist them with giving effect to this order and to engage any resources that may assist them in co-parenting.

[85] R.E. and A.S are encouraged to engage with or continue in any counselling or programming that may assist them in co-parenting the Children in a manner that is in the best interests of the Children.

[86] In the event of an emergency, or a situation arises where the parent exercising parenting time becomes incapable of caring for the Children, that parent will ensure the other parent is notified and that arrangements are made to ensure that the Children are transitioned to the other parent before being placed with any other family member, or a person outside of the family. This does not include situations where the parent exercising parenting time is unavailable to care for the Children due to an appointment, work commitment, counselling or schooling and has made arrangements for another adult to temporarily care for, or in the case of a family member, spend time with, the Children while that parent is outside of the home.

## Order - Child Support and Retroactive Adjustment

[87] R.E. is found to be resident in the Province of British Columbia with an income of $65,630.00. Commencing November 1, 2024, R.E. shall pay A.S child support in the amount of $1,019 per month for the Children M.S.E. [omitted for publication] and G.S.E. [omitted for publication]. This payment will be made on a bi-weekly basis in the amount of $470.31.

[88] A.S. has requested a retroactive adjustment of the child support to June 2022, in light of R.E.'s 2023 income tax assessment. The evidence I have before me is that R.E. had made regular payments of child support to A.S. in accordance with the Boblin Order and has not missed a payment. I have no evidence before me about whether or not A.S. asked for additional money, nor do I have information that R.E. intentionally withheld money. Additionally, I have no evidence about what impact, if any, a retroactive adjustment would have to the Children's wellbeing or standard of living. I accept that finances are tight for both parties and that the additional cost of supervised video visits had an impact on the financial situation of both A.S. and R.E. I also find that R.E. is not guilty of any blameworthy conduct which resulted in an underpayment. The parties relied on a court order and R.E. is not a sophisticated litigant, nor did he have legal

counsel. I also have no evidence before me as to why A.S. delayed requesting this money from R.E., or at least notifying him of her request to seek the order for retroactive payment until the date of the trial so that R.E. could voluntarily adjust any payments.

[89] I have considered the applicable legal principles relating to applications for retroactive child support payments as outlined in D.B.S. v. S.R.G , 2006 SCC 37. As the Supreme Court of Canada noted at para. 54: 'parents have an obligation to support their children in a manner commensurate with their income. This parental obligation, like the children's concomitant right to support, exist independently of any statute or court order.'

[90] In determining whether to make the order sought by A.S., I have taken a 'holistic view' of the matter. In doing so, I have considered the evidence before me and the lack thereof, along with A.S.'s general lack of communication, with R.E. about the circumstances of the Children and their needs. I find that R.E. diligently complied with his obligations pursuant to the Boblin Order and at no time deliberately paid A.S. less than what the children were owed. I find no blameworthy conduct on R.E.'s part. I also conclude that given R.E.'s tight financial situation, along with R.E.'s financial obligations to his child L.E., making the order sought would cause a hardship and would adversely impact his ability to meet his financial obligations to all of his children going forward, particularly in light of the more robust parenting time schedule that I have now ordered. Accordingly, I decline to make the retroactive award.

[91] To avoid a future scenario where the amount of child support paid falls below the payor parent's current income, I am ordering that effective immediately, and going forward, the parties will exchange a copy of their federal Income Tax Return and Notice of Assessment no later than June 30 of each year. Should a change in income warrant an adjustment in the table amount identified by the Federal Child Support Guidelines , SOR/97-175, the new child support amount will be payable, calculated on a bi-weekly

basis commencing August 1 of the calendar year unless the parties agree, in writing, to a different payment schedule.
