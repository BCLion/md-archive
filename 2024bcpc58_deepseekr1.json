    "summary_holding": "Relocation permitted due to enhanced stability, caregiver support, and respondent's conduct posing risk to children; parental responsibilities shared with final decision-making to applicant.",
    "winning_argument_type": "Relocation justified by caregiver stability, financial/emotional benefits under Barendregt, and respondent's criminal conduct impacting child safety (s.37(2)(j) FLA).",
    "failed_argument_type": "Failed to rebut relocation justification; reliance on outdated maximum contact principle rejected by Barendregt; minimized criminal recognizance's impact on child well-being.",
    "judicial_disdain": "B.G. has demonstrated poor parental judgement. This puts his children’s safety, security, and well-being at risk (¶92). The allegations significantly affected the children (¶109).",

    "precedent_gap": "None noted. Court strictly applied SCC precedents, rejecting maximum contact presumption per Barendregt.",
    "strategic_takeaway": "Relocation may be granted where primary caregiver's stability is enhanced, especially with evidence of opposing parent's conduct creating risk (FLA s.37(2)(j)). Maximum contact arguments are invalid post-Barendregt.",
    "counsels_analysis": "Issue: Whether relocation served children’s best interests. Rule: FLA s.46 requires assessing applicant’s reasons against s.37 factors. Application: Criminal recognizance (s.810 CC) against respondent directly impacted child safety (s.37(2)(j)), while applicant’s move improved financial/emotional stability (Barendregt ¶169). Respondent’s family violence history (s.37(2)(g)) and disregard for Elders’ directives further undermined his position. Cultural preservation received minimal weight due to parties’ prior choices. Conclusion: Relocation granted as it maximized safety and caregiver capacity under s.37(3).",
