- [1] These are my reasons for judgement on this Application about a Family Law Matter.  They were delivered orally on May 16, 2025 and have since been edited for distribution.

## Introduction

- [2] R.H. applies pursuant to sections 59 and 60 of the Family Law Act , S.B.C. 2011 c. 25 [ FLA ] for specified, unsupervised contact time with his 10-year old biological son, K.H. (the 'Application').  K.H. is a neurodivergent child diagnosed with a complex form of ADHD.  Additionally, K.H. is on the waitlist for a developmental assessment at [omitted for publication].  K.H. presently lives with the respondents W.H. and D.H. (the 'H.'s') who are his grandparents and legal guardians.  K.H. has lived with the H.'s since being placed into their care in 2016.
- [3] On April 19, 2018, R.H. and K.H.'s biological mother, K.N., consented to an order made by Judge Ormiston pursuant to section 54.01 of the Child, Family and Community Services Act , R.S.B.C. 1996 c. 46 [ CFCSA ] that resulted in their loss of guardianship over K.H., and his being permanently transferred into the custody of the H.'s (the 'Ormiston Order').  The Ormiston Order included a term pursuant to s. 57.01 of the CFCSA permitting R.H. supervised access to K.H. at the discretion of the H.'s.
- [4] R. H. argues that a material change in circumstances has occurred since the Ormiston Order and it is now in K.H.'s best interests that he have specified, unsupervised contact time with his son.  He has been sober for nearly seven years and has a stable and safe home.  He runs his own business and believes that it is important that he and K.H. have a more natural relationship, not one where the quality and quantity of the time they spend together is subject to the supervision and control by the H.'s.  The H.'s initially opposed R.H.'s application entirely, however, by the time the trial concluded, their position somewhat softened.  They now agree that some unsupervised contact time is warranted, however, they argue that it should be much more limited in duration and subject to conditions governing R.H.'s conduct.  They argue that R.H. has not demonstrated an ability to safely manage the needs of K.H. and they worry that he

will provide information to K.H. inconsistent with their wishes, and engage in activities or conduct inconsistent with their parenting approach.

- [5] The trial commenced before Judge Ormiston in August 2024.  After hearing two days of evidence, Judge Ormiston was appointed to the Supreme Court of British Columbia and I was assigned to take over as the trial judge.  At a case management conference on January 16, 2025, I advised the parties that should either wish to make an application for a mistrial given the change in trial judge; they were to bring their application before the end of February 2025.  No application was made and the trial resumed for three additional days in April 2025.  Prior to the trial re-commencing, I reviewed the evidence heard by Judge Ormiston.
- [6] R.H. called five witnesses in his case: himself, his current partner K.R.H. and friends M.C., J.M. and A.P.  The H.'s called three witnesses: D.H., W.H. and their family physician, Dr. S.M.  I qualified Dr. M. as an expert witness capable of giving opinion evidence in the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in young people.  In addition to the witnesses called by each party and before closing submissions, I conducted a judicial interview of K.H., following which I provided the parties an overview of what the interview revealed.
- [7] Some of the evidence called on this trial helped to provide context to the application; however, a large portion focused on each of the parties identifying the shortcomings of the other in order to illustrate why their position was in K.H.'s best interests.  The reality of the case; however, demonstrated that the parties were so entrenched in their own views that they each lost sight of what arrangement is truly in K.H.'s best interests.  This trial, in my view, is best summarized as one driven by hurt feelings.  I have carefully considered all of the evidence put before the Court; however, I will only reference the evidence of a particular witness, if I find it necessary to do so to express my reasons in this case.

## Background Circumstances

## A.  K.H.'s Birth and Removal

- [8] At the time of K.H.'s birth, his mother and father were actively in the throws of drug addiction.  K.H. was born premature and spent the first six months of his life in the hospital's neo-natal intensive care unit.  When K.H. was released from hospital, he went to live with his mother and father, along with his half siblings at their home in [omitted for publication].
- [9] R.H. often worked out of town sending money home.  While away, he used illicit substances.  K.N. remained at home attempting to care for K.H. and his siblings, while also actively using illicit substances.  At some point, R.H. quit his employment and he and K.N. struggled to provide for their children.  From time to time, R.H. would steal food to feed his family.  Over time, child protection concerns came to the attention of the Ministry of Children and Family Development (the 'Ministry') and social workers commenced involvement with the family.  For their part, the H.'s made the difficult decision to make a separate complaint to the Ministry after their dissatisfaction over how the original social worker was handling the family situation.  On numerous occasions, the H.'s observed the home in disarray and the children going without food.  They would take K.H. for several hours and over nights in order to remove him from the desperate situation of the family home and provide him some respite.
- [10] In October 2016, the Ministry removed K.H. and initially placed him into the care of his maternal grandparents along with his siblings.  He was not even two years old. In December 2016, K.H. was placed in the interim custody of the H.'s under the supervision of the Director.  During this period, R.H. and K.N. continued to struggle with addiction; however, had regular visits with K.H., supervised by the H.'s.
- [11] In 2017 the relationship between R.H. and K.N. dissolved.  R.H. was charged with assaulting K.N., a charge that was ultimately resolved by way of the imposition of a recognizance pursuant to s. 810 of the Criminal Code .  Following the dissolution of the relationship, R.H. initially stayed with his parents; however, he was required to leave at

the instance of the Ministry.  Following that, R.H. became homeless and lived on the streets.  His contact with K.H. and the H.'s became more sporadic as he fell deeper into the throes of his addiction.  By April 2018, he and K.N. consented to a permanent transfer of custody of K.H. to the H.'s pursuant to the provisions of the CFCSA , resulting in the Ormiston Order.  By providing their consent, there was never a finding that K.H. was in need of protection, although the evidence lead at trial establishes that he most certainly was and there was no realistic prospect of the parents' circumstances changing any time in the foreseeable future.

- [12] At some point, W.H. learned that R.H. was living behind a Walmart in a tent and he contacted a friend of R.H. to assist.  That friend offered a trailer and space on his property.  This move happened around the same time that R.H. had a near death experience owing to the consumption of toxic drugs.  Having hit his 'rock bottom', R.H. made the decision to enter treatment.

## B.  R.H. Completes Treatment

- [13] In December 2018, R.H. entered into a residential program at [omitted for publication].  He successfully completed a 70-day in patient program in February 2019 and he has been clean and sober ever since.  While he was at [omitted for publication] the H.'s maintained contact with him and ensured he maintained a connection with K.H.
- [14] Following R.H.'s successful completion of treatment, he went to live with a friend in [omitted for publication], went back to work as an ironworker and continued having supervised visits with K.H. at the discretion of the H.'s.  With his life becoming more stable, R.H. expressed a desire to have a more natural relationship with K.H., as his father.  Over time, R.H. would express his views to the H.'s about how K.H. was being raised including issues around toilet training, physical discipline and the use of formula. The expression of these views and R.H.'s natural desire to parent eventually resulted in tension and conflict between the parties.  R.H. believed that the H.'s would dismiss him and the H.'s believed R.H. would undermine their authority as K.H.'s legal guardians.

- [15] The evidence in this case illustrated this tension.  Two events help provide the context of the burgeoning conflict.  Firstly, the Court heard that when K.H. was young, he required dental surgery because of how the formula he consumed affected the colour and integrity of his teeth.  It is clear from the evidence that R.H. unfairly laid blame for K.H.'s situation at the feet of his parents and did not accept their explanations about how the situation occurred - a situation that was out of their control.  Because of that, the H.'s became guarded in the information they shared with R.H., and eventually stopped sharing critical information in order to avoid conflict.  While this was their legal right, the impact of the decision ultimately resulted in shutting R.H. out of significant events that occurred in K.H.'s life, feeding into what eventually became an unfortunate level of mistrust.
- [16] A significant example of this occurred when K.H. required surgery at BC Children's Hospital.  R.H. was never informed of the surgery or K.H.'s need for it before, during or after.  In fact, R.H. only learned of K.H.'s surgery well after the fact, from K.H. during a video call.  D.H. testified that she did not have sufficient time to inform R.H. of such a significant life event because of the sudden nature of the surgery, itself.  They were called off a cancellation list and had less than 24 hours to get prepared and go to Vancouver from [omitted for publication] for the surgery.  I do not accept D.H.'s explanation about why she failed to inform R.H.  I found it to be contrived and designed to explain away, or justify, a poor decision on her part.  Consistent with the evidence on the trial and D.H.'s decision to eventually distance herself from her son, I find that D.H. did not tell R.H. of the surgery simply because she was not required to and she wanted to avoid needing to answer his inevitable questions about it.  I also find that R.H.'s post-recovery expressions about his desire to regain guardianship of his son informed the approach taken by the H.'s when it came to ensuring R.H. was equipped with information about K.H.

## C.  Conflict Between R.H. and The H.'s

- [17] R.H. testified that at some point, after a different confrontation with his mother, the H.'s stopped communicating with him and his contact with K.H. was further

curtailed.  The H.'s deny this and say that any reduction in contact time was owing to R.H. being sporadic in his efforts.  What is consistent between both parties is that R.H. did not have contact with K.H. for an extended period following a fallout with his mother.

- [18] In early 2020, R.H. went to the family justice centre to seek assistance to attempt mediation between himself and his parents around his contact with K.H.; however, that mediation did not occur as the mediator was unable to connect with the H.'s.  When R.H. went to his parent's home to discuss the potential mediation, his father told him he was not ready and his mother would not engage with him and left the room.  Because of this, R.H. filed an application for guardianship in March 2020, just prior to the COVID-19 lockdown.  For one reason or another, this application never did proceed through the courts.
- [19] When the COVID-19 pandemic hit and public health restrictions were imposed, the H.'s ceased facilitating R.H.'s in person access to K.H.  R.H. took exception to this and did not accept his parent's explanation that they were doing so in compliance with public health orders.  He believed that the H.'s were continuing in person contact with his older brother J.H.'s family, despite the restrictions, and he came to that conclusion because, on at least one occasion, he heard his brother's voice in the background while he was speaking with K.H.  The H.'s deny maintaining in person contact with J.H. during the period where there were COVID health restrictions in place; however, I have some hesitation in accepting that evidence given my overall assessment of D.H.'s testimony at this trial.  I found D.H. to be internally and externally inconsistent and she often provided unnecessary and gratuitous evidence aimed at undermining R.H.'s credibility wherever she felt the Court required the 'entire' picture, or where the evidence tended to reflect poorly on her other son.
- [20] Regardless, what is without question is that R.H. was not provided any in person contact with K.H. for approximately eight months.  At no time during the period where there were restrictions on in person gatherings did the H.'s check to see if exemptions existed that permitted a parent to maintain physical contact with a child when that child did not live with the parent.  Intentional or not, the result of this decision by the H.'s was

to further fracture their relationship with R.H. and introduce a barrier between R.H. and K.H. by removing an important physical connection.

[21] On December 1, 2020, W.H. facilitated an in person visit between R.H. and K.H. at R.H.'s home.  By this point, R.H. had moved to a RV park in [omitted for publication] and had met his current partner, K.R.H.  Both K.H. and W.H. met K.R.H. during this visit.  R.H. had his next in person contact time with K.H. on Boxing Day that year.

[22] As I understand it, regular in person contact resumed with K.H. after Boxing Day 2020.  I am told that visits would be arranged whenever R.H. and W.H. spoke, and the process for arranging visits was relatively unstructured; however, W.H. needed to be present and available to supervise the visit.  The H.'s did not permit R.H. to have unsupervised visits with K.H., despite his requests.

[23] In the spring of 2021, R.H. moved to his current home at a RV park in [omitted for publication].  He shares a large site with K.R.H. and her sons where the two have parked their respective trailers and share a deck along with recreational space and equipment.  Following the move to [omitted for publication], R.H. and K.H.'s in person visits continued with some frequency, at times occurring at the trailer park.  K.H. also became familiar with K.R.H.'s two sons.

[24] Near the end of 2021, R.H.'s brother, J.H., sold his home in [omitted for publication] and moved with his family to Alberta.  The H.'s were close with J.H. and his family, often vacationing together and spending time at each other's homes.  K.H. had developed a strong relationship with J.H.'s two children and the two families regularly supported each other with childcare needs.  I conclude from the evidence that this move represented a material change in the social support network available to the H.'s.  This move, and the events that flowed from it, also added fuel to the already brewing conflict between R.H. and his parents.

## D.  Circumstances Giving Rise to the Present Application

[25] During a visit at R.H.'s home in February 2022, W.H. asked R.H. how much money he thought he could get if he and K.R.H. sold their trailers.  When the visit was

over, R.H. and K.R.H. had a conversation where they concluded that the H.'s were planning to move to Alberta to be closer to J.H. and his family.

- [26] In order to get ahead of any move, R.H. went to the courthouse to recommence his family law claim; however, the Provincial Court Family Rules changed since his last application and the required paperwork and procedures were different.  This lead R.H. to conclude he needed the assistance of a lawyer.  He had an initial consultation with one and began monitoring the real estate listings.  Within a week, he had located his parents' home on the real estate multiple listing service website.  He was, understandably, upset.
- [27] After finding out that his parents had listed their home, R.H. sent them an email, a copy of which was entered into evidence.  In that email dated March 10, 2022, R.H. expressed gratitude to his parents for caring for K.H. and an understanding of why they wanted to move to Alberta, but he made clear his concerns about losing K.H. again.  He outlined for his parents the hard work he had done since the Ormiston Order was made and his desire be a parent again to his child without restriction.  To that end, he advised his parents that he was going to seek the assistance of a lawyer and regretted that it came to this point.
- [28] That same day, D.H. sent R.H. a text message in response to his email apologizing for how he found out about the house sale and the move to Alberta.  These messages were also admitted into evidence.  D.H. invited R.H. over for a conversation to discuss the 'bigger picture.'  R.H. advised his mother he could not come out to [omitted for publication] that day, but suggested he could come over on Saturday and they agreed to meet.  Two hours later, D.H. sent another text message telling R.H. that her lawyer requested they meet for a 'final exercise of discussion' and she wanted information about K.R.H. so that her lawyer could conduct an 'investigation.'  She told R.H. this information could easily be obtained by them from the mobile home park where he was living, but she wanted to avoid 'unnecessary involvement.'  When R.H. questioned this, D.H. became aggressive and advised that her lawyer 'was already over this stuff and [could] subpoena whatever [they] didn't get.'  What followed is what can

9

be best described as further confrontational messages on D.H.'s part when R.H. tried to seek clarification on what she was asking for and why.

- [29] The following day, R.H. sent his mother a message asked her to ensure that her lawyer spoke with his lawyer, unless the H.'s were 'having a change of heart and deciding to sign guardianship of K.H. back over to [him].'  He also told her that he was 'not interested in negative conflict.'
- [30] R.H. went to his parent's home to discuss the Alberta move on March 12, 2022 as planned.  During that meeting, D.H. told R.H. that she wanted to follow J.H. to Alberta and they had several properties under consideration for him to view.  The H.'s' hope was that R.H. and K.R.H. would move with them and live on their property. Following a brief conversation, the meeting became heated and R.H. left.  Prior to leaving, he again told the H.'s that they would not be leaving with his son and he would be seeking guardianship over K.H.
- [31] On March 17, 2022, R.H.'s brother J.H. sent him a text message calling him names, telling him he was 'completely incapable of handling K.H.' and when his life was 'put under a microscope by a judge', he would not 'come out of this looking good.'  J.H. told R.H. that his lawyer 'will take what little money [he has] and [it] won't have changed much.'  The H.'s testified that they believed this text message was in response to R.H. not returning J.H.'s expensive truck on time.  I do not accept this explanation.  I find that given the context of the family unit at the time and the content of the message, this message was sent in response to R.H. taking steps to stop the move to Alberta and seek guardianship of K.H.
- [32] D.H. denied that the move to Alberta was planned.  She told that she and her husband were just looking at options and seeing how much money they could get for their house.  She told the Court that she also looked at other places in the local area and in other parts of British Columbia.  A move to Alberta, she says, would have permitted her to stop working and retire earlier.

[33] I do not accept D.H.'s evidence that the move to Alberta was not in the plans.  It is entirely inconsistent with the objective evidence of the communications between herself and R.H., the evidence of looking at Alberta properties, the context of the message from J.H. and the explanation for why she wanted to move.  I find that her evidence in court was again designed to minimize the impact of the H.'s' unfortunate approach towards R.H. at the time - particularly their intentional decisions to keep him out of the loop when it came to information about K.H.

[34] Once R.H. frustrated the move to Alberta, I am satisfied that D.H. decided to completely cut herself off from R.H. and download all responsibility for organizing K.H. and R.H.'s contact time onto her husband.  I also find that as a result of the frustrated move, D.H. drastically changed the family's approach to arranging contact between R.H. and K.H. from an organic and free flowing approach, to a formalistic, structured approach by email only.  This change in approach is evidenced by several documents received into evidence and the testimony of the parties.  While I appreciate not being able to move had a significant impact on D.H.'s ability to retire, the decision to reduce requests for contact time to writing introduced a formalistic barrier to R.H.'s relationship with K.H.  There were several instances where communications about contact time were responded to after hours would pass by and where requests for information were completely ignored.  None of this, I find, advanced K.H.'s interests.  Additionally, despite efforts on R.H.'s part to make amends with his mother, it appears that D.H. double downed on her anger with him and cut him out of her life completely.  A telling example of this was when R.H. and K.R.H. arrived at the home of the H.'s to bring her flowers and a cake, and she refused to acknowledge or meet with them.  Her explanation for this was that she was tired from her day at work.

[35] In spite of this, supervised visits continued with some frequency.  What did not occur was the H'.s providing R.H. with information about K.H.'s eventual diagnosis with ADHD, his challenges in school and the ongoing assessment into his psychosocial and educational needs as a neurodivergent child.  While the decision to release this information fell squarely within the parental responsibilities afforded to the H.'s as K.H.'s

guardians, the practical effect resulted in undermining the ability of R.H. to have an informed relationship with his child.

## K.H.'s ADHD Diagnosis

[36] After a series of meetings with school officials and the family doctor, K.H. was referred to paediatrician Dr. P.R.  Following an assessment of K.H.'s 'comprehensive clinical history,' Dr. R. diagnosed K.H. as having met criteria for combined attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  Dr. R. outlined a multi-modal treatment approach (including the use of medications), noting that 'treatment must be collaborative among the family, the teaching faculty and school, the physician and the patient.'  Dr. R. advised the H.'s that there were two important components of the multimodal approach which included 'educating the family and the patient about ADHD symptoms, functional impairment, possible comorbidities and available treatment strategies' to ensure a successful outcome.

[37] The H.'s informed the school of K.H.'s diagnosis and he was placed on an Individualized Education Plan (IEP).  They eventually also agreed to place K.H. on medications to assist his success in school; [omitted for publication].  This remains the fact today.

[38] Significantly, the H.'s did not advise R.H. of any of this important information and the fact that K.H.'s needs were being professionally addressed.  In fact, R.H. found out nothing related to K.H.'s diagnosis, or the fact that he was placed on an IEP until December 2023 when the parties attended the family justice counsellor for a mediation, prior to the trial of this matter.  While, again, this was entirely within their legal right, I can hardly see how robbing R.H. of this vital information was remotely in K.H.'s best interests.

[39] What this decision did do, I find, is add to what was already a considerable power imbalance between R.H. and his parents and undermined R.H.'s ability to engage with his son in an informed, safe manner that to the greatest extent possible protected his physical, psychological and emotional safety, security and well-being.

- [40] R.H. told the Court that after finding out that K.H. was diagnosed with ADHD, he has since educated himself on the diagnosis and how to work with a child who has the complex needs K.H. has.  I accept his evidence on this point.

## K.H.'s Present Circumstances

- [41] K.H. is a bright, articulate 10-year old boy with a keen interest in technology.  He enjoys playing sports and is very active.  He has a few close friends and enjoys a close connection with the H.'s and his extended family, particularly his paternal cousins.
- [42] Since coming into the care of the H.'s, K.H. has benefitted greatly from a supportive, loving home environment where he has been given every possible opportunity to flourish and develop.  It is clear from the evidence that the H.'s have taken their duty to K.H. seriously, and they are committed to ensuring that his life is as 'normal' as possible.  [omitted for publication].  When K.H. initially came into their care, the H.'s ensured that communication lines with R.H. remained open and that K.H. maintained a relationship with his father.  However, as I alluded to earlier, over time, that relationship became strained as conflicts arose between R.H. and the H.'s, particularly where the decisions, wishes and philosophies of the legal guardian and biological parent did not align.
- [43] As K.H. progressed in school, it became clear that his needs were different from other children.  He experienced behaviour and academic challenges.  He struggled with change and quick transitions.  He had conflict with other children.  In Grade Four his needs were finally addressed through the implementation of an IEP.  He was eventually diagnosed with combined ADHD and he began a medication regime.
- [44] K.H.'s ADHD is presently managed by medications and he has a structured daily schedule and routine.  The structure, I am told, is important to maintain his success and development.  I am also told that front-loading K.H. with information about his day is critical to ensuring his success.
- [45] Dr. S.M., K.H.'s family doctor, was qualified as an expert in this case to give evidence about the diagnosis and management of ADHD.  He told the Court that K.H.'s

circumstances are complex and his needs are high.  He also testified that K.H.'s neurodivergence is of a particular nature that he has been referred to [omitted for publication] for further assessments.  He also testified that it is important for any person responsible for K.H.'s care to be fully informed about his needs to ensure they are able to safely respond to any challenges presented as a result of his neurodivergence. Finally, he told the Court that K.H. is now at an age where [omitted for publication].

- [46] During the trial, I conducted a judicial interview of K.H. and provided the parties with a high level summary of it.  From that interview, it was clear to me that K.H.'s needs are particularly complex, however, I also have no concerns about his ability to appropriately assert boundaries.  He was more than capable of refusing to speak when he felt that the information that would be revealed was private in nature.  Most importantly, he told me he loves his family and wants to spend more time with his father.

## Legal Framework

[47] This is not an application by R.H. to regain guardianship over K.H.  It is an application to vary an existing order to permit structured, unsupervised contact time. This application requires the Court to vary the existing final order - the Ormiston Order - if it is satisfied that (a) a material change in circumstances has occurred and (b) any variation that is ordered is in K.H.'s best interests.

## A.  Variations and Material Change in Circumstances

- [48] By virtue of section 59(4) of the FLA , an access order made pursuant to s. 54.2(2.1) of the CFCSA is deemed to be a contact order made pursuant to s. 59(1) of the FLA .  Section 60 of the FLA enables the court to change, suspend or terminate a contact order if the court is satisfied that a material change in needs or circumstances of the child, including any changes that result from the change of circumstances of another person.
- [49] A material change in circumstances can arise where the present circumstances of a parent, the child or a person seeking to vary contact with the child gives rise to the question of whether the previous order might have been different had the circumstances

now existing prevailed earlier: see Williams v. Williams , 2016 BCCA 87 [ Williams ] at paras. 32-33, citing Gordon v. Goertz , [1996] 2 S.C.R. 27 at 43.  Absent a material change in the needs or circumstances of the child or the circumstances of another person, the inquiry goes no further; however, if this threshold is met, the judge can then embark on a fresh inquiry into the best interest of the child: Williams at para. 34.

## B.  Applications for Contact

- [50] When the Ormiston Order was made, R.H.'s guardianship over K.H. was terminated and transferred to the H.s.  At that time, R.H. consented and agreed that there was no significant likelihood that the circumstances that lead to K.H.'s removal would improve within a reasonable time or that he or K.N. would be able to meet K.H.'s needs.  While there was no finding that K.H. was in need of protection at the time of his removal, it is clear to me that such a finding would have been a foregone conclusion. In my view, the child protection context that gave rise to R.H.'s loss of guardianship must inform any future decisions made about his relationship with K.H. and what that looks like.
- [51] While he remains K.H.'s father, his legal status rests as a non-guardian. Therefore, any application for scheduled, unsupervised time with K.H. falls under s. 59 of the FLA .
- [52] Section 59 of the FLA empowers the Court, on application, to make an order respecting contact with a child, including describing the terms and form of contact: s. 59(1).  This may include contact under supervision: s. 59(3).  A goal of contact time is to ensure that any relationships of significance for the child are maintained and nurtured.  It is without question that a healthy, safe and loving relationship between a father and a child amounts to a relationship of significance.

## C.  Best Interests of the Child

- [53] When making a decision about contact with a child, the FLA requires that the parties and the Court must consider the best interests of the child only: s. 37(1) FLA . Section 37(2) of the FLA requires the Court to consider a variety of factors when

determining whether an order is in the best interests of the child.  Amongst those factors are the child's health and emotional well-being, the child's views, the nature and strength of the relationships between the child and significant persons in the child's life, the history of the child's care, the child's need for stability, given the child's age and stage of development, the ability of each person who seeks contact with the child to exercise their responsibilities, and the appropriateness of an arrangement that would require the child's guardians to cooperate on issues affecting the child, including whether requiring cooperation would increase any risks to the safety, security or wellbeing of the child or other family members.  The statute is also very clear, an order is not in the best interests of a child unless it protects, to the greatest extent possible, the child's physical, psychological and emotional safety, security and well-being: FLA s. 37(3).

## Analysis

## A.  Material Change in Circumstances

[54] Since the Ormiston Order, R.H. has demonstrated a sustained ability to turn his life around.  He went from rock bottom, deep in the throes of addiction and incapable of caring for his child and himself, to a sustained period of sobriety, a stable life and he now runs his own business.  His achievements call for nothing short of celebration given the fact that addiction to illicit substances often results in a cycle of continuous despair and even tragedy, and he was able to break that.  His efforts are inspiring and should serve as a signal to anyone that no person is beyond rehabilitation, no matter how desperate their circumstances may be.

[55] At the time the Ormiston Order was made, I am satisfied that the circumstances were such that the best interests of K.H. and the CFCSA 's guiding principles, along with the requirements of s. 54.01 mandated the need for K.H.'s permanent transfer of custody to the H.s.  I am also satisfied that the need to recognize the quality of the relationship K.H. had with his father and to give effect to maintaining it while also giving paramount consideration to the safety and wellbeing of K.H. the supervision order was both reasonable and necessary.

[56] However, that being said, given the substantial strides in R.H.'s life and his ability to now be a safe and supportive parent to K.H. who is capable of acting in his best interests, I am satisfied that the circumstances that lead to his removal are no longer present and R.H. can safely meet K.H.'s needs.  Thus, the evidence has established a material change in circumstances.  Simply put, had R.H.'s present circumstances have existed at the time of the Ormiston Order, there would have been no child protection concerns and K.H. would not have been transferred into the H.'s custody.

## B.  Best Interests of the Child

[57] Having found a material change in circumstances, I must now consider whether the variation sought by R.H. is in K.H.'s best interests.  While the H.'s now agree that some limited unsupervised contact is warranted, they cite safety concerns and R.H.'s inability to properly supervise K.H. as well as a fear that R.H. will interfere with their parenting responsibilities as a reason for why the Court should not grant the application. In other words, they submit that R.H. is not capable of exercising his responsibilities without their supervision beyond short, tightly controlled periods of time.

## a.  Safety Concerns

[58] Considerable evidence was lead about R.H. inability to manage K.H. while in his care.  I do not accept any of that evidence as a reason to reject his application.

[59] Firstly, the claim that R.H. unable to properly manage K.H.'s psychological, social and educational needs while he exercises contact time is not supported by any credible evidence.  Despite the substantial barriers put up by the H.'s in the form of withholding vital information about K.H.'s diagnosis and his medical, social and educational needs, no evidence was put before the Court that suggests that R.H. is incapable of appreciating those needs and keeping K.H. safe.  He has taken steps to inform himself of K.H.'s diagnosis, and if the H.'s are serious about their commitment to K.H.'s future success and his best interests, they will bring R.H. into the conversations about K.H. and keep him informed.

[60] Knowledge is power.  That power should be used to propel K.H. forward in life in the best way possible.  It should not be used to exert power or control over the other party.  The former, collaborative approach, is consistent with the plan of care outlined by K.H.'s medical professionals and it puts K.H.'s interests at the forefront.  It can only help K.H.  The latter, more restrictive approach, selfishly centres on the adult decision maker and can only harm K.H.

[61] Additionally, I reject any claim that R.H. is not able to exercise adequate supervision over K.H. and keep him safe from harm should he be left alone with K.H.

[62] The evidence put before me suggests that in an effort to exert their control over parenting responsibilities, the H.'s, in effect, undermined R.H.'s ability to continuously develop a natural parent-child bond with K.H.  They also have placed unreasonably high standards upon R.H.  What I distil from the evidence of D.H. and W.H. is that, in their view, R.H. is either inattentive when it comes to K.H. or he over reacts.  Two telling examples in the evidence from the H.'s illustrate this.

[63] The first scenario was lead as evidence of R.H.'s inability to effectively supervise K.H.  It occurred while he was at a Home Depot with K.H. and W.H.  While R.H. was momentarily looking at some product, K.H. wandered off. W.H. turned around and noticed K.H. was missing and asked R.H. where K.H. was.  The two men looked for K.H. and he was ultimately found looking at a Christmas display.  R.H. was chastised by W.H. for paying insufficient attention.

[64] The second scenario was put before me to demonstrate R.H.'s over-reaction to K.H.  In that scenario, R.H., his father and K.H. were at a park and K.H. was playing on a playground with R.H. supervising.  W.H. watched from a distance and observed that K.H. had moved from the playground structure out of R.H.'s sight.  He then observed R.H. panic and frantically start looking for K.H. when he could not see K.H. on the playground.  W.H. allowed this panic and search for K.H. to go on for a few moments in order to 'test' R.H.  He knew where K.H. was and when he stopped R.H.'s frantic search and pointed K.H. out, he then made fun of his son for overreacting.

[65] Neither of these scenarios causes me to doubt R.H.'s ability to effectively and safely have K.H. in his control without supervision.  I find, as a fact, that R.H.'s conduct in both scenarios is not markedly different than any other reasonable parent in the circumstances.  He cannot be faulted for K.H. wandering to a Christmas display and he cannot be faulted for panicking when he lost sight of his child at a playground.  The sad reality of the evidence tendered in this trial leads me to conclude that it does not matter what R.H. does when he is given an opportunity to supervise his child.  In the H.'s eyes, he will simply do it wrong.

[66] Other safety concerns highlighted included the nature of the mobile home park where R.H. lives and the presence of items in his yard that could pose a hazard.  I do not find any of these concerns to be of material significance.  I am more than satisfied that R.H. is capable of caring for K.H. and ensuring his safety when K.H. is under his supervision.

## b.  Potential Interference with Parenting Responsibilities

[67] The H.'s argue that R.H. refuses to acknowledge that his role as it relates to K.H. is legally different from theirs and he will not accept that they have the legal authority for parenting responsibilities.  This includes obtaining information from third parties and making decisions about the day-to-day care and needs of K.H.  They also take issue with R.H.'s partner, K.R.H., believing she will undermine them when she is around K.H.

[68] The H.'s also argue that R.H. has demonstrated a lack of understanding for his role and when he had previous unsupervised time, he took advantage of it.  The unsupervised contact time at issue was incidental contact in a changing facility at a waterpark where R.H. was unexpectedly faced with a question from K.H. about why he does not live with father or mother.  The H.'s are further upset that R.H. attempted to obtain information about K.H.'s education directly from K.H.'s school.  I note that this occurred after R.H. found out about K.H.'s diagnosis and the H.'s repeatedly and unnecessarily withheld information about K.H. from him.

[69] The H.'s argue that 'as K.H.'s guardians, W.H. and D.H. have the right to decide what information is shared with [and about] K.H., and their decision needs to be respected.'  They fear R.H. will [omitted for publication].

[70] I agree with the H.'s that the evidence establishes that R.H. has struggled with understanding how his role as a non-guardian parent is different from their role as a guardian-grandparent.  At the same time, it is this Court's view that the conflict that has arisen over these issues has largely been driven by the intentional decisions of the H.'s to exclude R.H. from important information about K.H.'s life for several years.  Because of this, deep mistrust had developed.

[71] At the end of the day, R.H., while not his legal guardian, remains K.H.'s father and an important person in his life.  K.H. is bonded with his father, loves his father, feels safe with his father and wants to spend time with his father.  R.H. loves his son, wants to further develop the relationship with his son and continue that important connection. I have no doubt that his hopes to one-day regain guardianship of K.H. have been a significant motivating feature in his recovery journey.  Effectively placing R.H. on the outside of the window looking in on all important decisions pertaining to K.H., while their right in law, impedes the development of this very important relationship for K.H. Fostering that father-son relationship is most certainly in K.H.'s best interests.  This would be very different if R.H. remained a child protection or safety concern; however, that is not the circumstances we have here.

[72] Likewise, R.H. needs to understand that it is the H.'s who took on the role of K.H.'s legal guardian when he was incapable of being one, and their decisions need to be respected.  They are the ones who exercise parenting responsibilities and are entitled to make critical, significant decisions about K.H.'s life.  Until such time he applies for and obtains guardianship over K.H., R.H. must work with the H.'s and operate within the framework they have set.  Undermining them, undermines K.H.'s stability. Undermining K.H.'s stability is not in K.H.'s best interests.

[73] Section 218 of the FLA permits the Court to include in an order any terms or conditions it considers appropriate in the circumstances.  I am satisfied that any order

I do impose can include terms that requires R.H. to conduct himself in an appropriate manner that is in K.H.'s best interests so that his conflict with the H.'s does not seep into his contact time with K.H.  Likewise, to ameliorate any concerns about K.R.H., I can impose conditions that requires R.H. to ensure that if she is around K.H., she conducts herself in a manner that is consistent with K.H.'s best interests.

[74] When I consider the factors outlined in section 37, I am satisfied that it is in K.H.'s best interest to vary the Ormiston Order and permit some structured, unsupervised contact time between R.H. and K.H.  As noted in the authorities, 'supervised contact, especially with prolonged or indefinite supervision, is an extreme measure that will only be ordered where the interests of the child demand it': Seibel v. Davis , 2017 BCSC 847 at para 58.  Continued supervised contact is no longer necessary in these circumstances and, it is no longer in K.H.'s best interests.

[75] Supporting a more natural relationship with his father is in the best interests of K.H.  It will advance his emotional well-being, will strengthen his relationship with his father and is consistent with his views.  Structured contact time will be something that K.H. will benefit from given his neurodivergent needs.  It will ensure there is a stable relationship between him and his father and is something, given K.H.'s age and stage of development, that K.H. would benefit from.  As noted earlier, I have no concerns with R.H.'s ability to exercise his responsibilities.  In short, I am satisfied that the order I am about to make is one that 'to the greatest extent possible protects the child's physical, psychological and emotional safety, security and well-being.'

[76] When making this Order, I am mindful that the legal authorities tell me that a guardian plays a significant role in a child's life, that their wishes should be respected and that courts should be reluctant to interfere with their decisions and only do so when the Court is satisfied that it is in the child's best interests.  I commend the H.'s for doing the remarkable and right thing by K.H.  While I have been critical about the decisions they have made vis-à-vis R.H., what the Court also recognizes and what nobody can lose sight of is they rescued K.H.  They stepped forward and took custody of their grandchild at a stage where they likely did not expect to have to raise another child, let

alone a toddler.  The impact of that decision must have been significant for them.  They raised K.H. as a son.  He most certainly is, as W.H. put it, their 'golden boy' and they have provided him with every opportunity to thrive and live a good life; a life that otherwise started out very bleak.

[77] At the same time, whether motivated by fear, mistrust, anger, hurt feelings or a combination of all of these factors, rather than celebrating R.H.'s successful rehabilitation and finding a way to move forward together, conflict eventually got to the better of everyone - R.H. included - and the parties lost sight of K.H.'s best interests while they were embroiled in their conflict.  Those best interests include promoting and supporting a healthy relationship between K.H. and his father.

[78] I know that people are going to leave here today unhappy and that is the unfortunate reality of family law litigation.  However, I am hopeful that this order now removes some of the conflict that has come to root in this family so that the parties can re-centre themselves on what is most important - K.H. It is the hope of this Court that any future family law issues that may arise can be resolved through a path of mutual agreement and respect.

[79] I am granting R.H.'s application.  The order of Judge Ormiston dated April 19, 2018 pursuant to s. 54.01 of the Child, Family and Community Services Act is varied as follows:

1.  The order term made pursuant to s. 57.01 of the Child, Family and Community Services Act providing R.H. access to K.H. supervised at the discretion of W.H. and D.H.is cancelled.

- f. Commencing in December 2025 and continuing each year thereafter, during the winter school break, R.H. will have contact time with K.H. for one continuous week to be agreed to by the parties no later than September 30 of each year.

- g.  In addition to the contact time prescribed in this order, R.H. may have additional contact time as agreed to by the parties.
- h.  Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, R.H. will be responsible for picking up and dropping off K.H. at the beginning and end of exercising his contact time.

- o.  The parties shall:
- a.  put the best interests of the child before their own interests;
- b.   encourage the child to have a good relationship with the other party and speak to the child about the other party and that party's partner in a positive and respectful manner; and
- c. make a real effort to maintain polite, respectful communications with each other, refraining from any negative or hostile criticism, communication or argument.
- p.  The parties shall encourage their respective families to refrain from any negative comments about the other party and their extended family, and from discussions in front of the child concerning family issues or litigation.
- [80] These are the terms of the order.  The order will be drafted by counsel for R.H. and filed with the Court within 14 days of today's date.
- [81] I hope this family can reach a point where reconciliation begins and healing is possible.  Reconciliation starts with rebuilding trust.  Trust can develop with open communication, mutual respect, following through on commitments and supporting each other.  I wish you all the very best of luck.  Most importantly, I wish K.H. every success in life and I hope you all can work together to help him achieve that.
