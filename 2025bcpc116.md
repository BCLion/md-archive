2025 BCPC 116 (CanLII)

- [1] The parties are the parents of nine year old E.A.M, born [omitted for publication], and seven year old E.P.M., born [omitted for publication]. The parties married June 30, 2013, and separated October 16, 2022, although they continued to reside in the same home until March 2023. Following separation they exercised a shared parenting arrangement, which was formalized in a separation agreement signed in November 2023.
- [2] In March 2024, C.L.M. gave notice to A.D.M. that she intended to relocate with the children to Victoria, B.C. A.D.M. objected and C.L.M. proceeded by way of an Application to set aside the Separation Agreement in order to relocate the children. C.L.M. has since moved to Victoria, secured a new job and purchased a home with her new partner. She flies to Prince George to exercise her parenting time every other week and works remotely.
- [3] This hearing proceeded over several days and was comprised of both viva voce and affidavit evidence.
- [4] As the parties have been in a shared parenting arrangement since separation, the principles of s. 69(5) of the Family Law Act ( 'FLA' ) apply. The onus is on C.L.M. to satisfy the court that:
5. (i) the proposed relocation is made in good faith;
6. (ii) she has proposed reasonable and workable arrangements to preserve the relationship between the children and their father, as well as any other persons who have a significant role in the children's life; and
7. (iii) that the relocation is in the children's best interests.
- [5] In making my determination, I cannot consider whether C.L.M. would still relocate if I prohibited the children from relocating (s. 69(7)).
- [6] The issue I must decide is whether the provisions of s. 69(5) of the FLA are satisfied such that I ought to vary the Separation Agreement to permit the children to be relocated to Victoria.

- [7] After considering all of the evidence and the factors set out in s. 69(5) of the FLA, I find it is in the children's best interests to remain in Prince George.

## Background

- [8] The parties started living together in Prince George in 2011. At the time, A.D.M. was attending the Fish and Wildlife Program at the University of Northern British Columbia, which he completed in 2014. C.L.M. was working at [omitted for publication] as a financial advisor. She holds a management diploma from Grant MacEwan University.
- [9] The parties married June 30, 2013, and purchased the family home in 2014. E.A.M. was born in 2016 and E.P.M. was born in 2018. During this time, A.D.M. was working as a biologist. He was eligible for funding through his historical military service and went back to school from 2021 to 2023 to earn his master's degree. The parties agreed once A.D.M. completed his education C.L.M. would pursue an MBA, and money was invested in an RRSP with that long-term goal.
- [10] C.L.M. grew up in Prince George and her parents, P.G. and S.G., continue to live here. Her parents have been important figures in the children's lives and routinely cared for the children to support the parties. Both children attend [omitted for publication] Elementary School in a community just outside Prince George City limits. E.A.M. is going into Grade 4 and E.P.M. is going into Grade 2.
- [11] The ending of the parties' marriage was precipitated by C.L.M.s' relationship with a co-worker, which was discovered by A.D.M. in the fall of 2022. C.L.M. and her coworker, M.S., subsequently ended both of their marriages to pursue their own relationship and are now engaged. M.S. lives in Victoria and exercises a shared parenting arrangement in respect of his two children with his former spouse. He is not willing to move to Prince George to live with C.L.M. Commencing in March 2023, C.L.M. started spending one week a month in Victoria to be with M.S. By August 2023, she spent half of each month in Victoria.

- [12] The parties entered into a Separation Agreement in November 2023. They agreed C.L.M. would retain the family home and the parties would share parenting time and parental responsibilities on an alternating weekly basis. They agreed no spousal or child support would be payable between them.
- [13] A couple of months later in January 2024, C.L.M. entered into discussions for an employment opportunity with [omitted for publication] in Victoria. She accepted a job offer from [omitted for publication] in March 2024 and moved to Victoria to live with M.S. Since then C.L.M. has been flying from Victoria to Prince George on alternating weeks to exercise her parenting time. She works remotely when in Prince George, but advises her employer will not support that working arrangement much longer. C.L.M. seeks to relocate the children to Victoria to live with her, M.S. and his two children (who stay with them alternating weeks).
- [14] C.L.M. provided A.D.M. notice of her intention to relocate the children on March 15, 2024. He objected and filed an Application for an Order Prohibiting the Relocation of a Child on April 5, 2024.
- [15] In Barendregt v. Grebliunas , 2022 SCC 22, the Court restated the relevant factors for the Court to consider in a relocation case, at paras 153-154:
5. 153 Our jurisprudence and statutes provide a rich foundation for such an inquiry: see, for example, s. 16 of the Divorce Act . A court shall consider all factors related to the circumstances of the child, which may include the child's views and preferences, the history of caregiving, any incidents of family violence, or a child's cultural, linguistic, religious and spiritual upbringing and heritage. A court shall also consider each parent's willingness to support the development and maintenance of the child's relationship with the other parent, and shall give effect to the principle that a child should have as much time with each parent, as is consistent with the best interests of the child. These examples are illustrative, not exhaustive. While some of these factors were specifically noted under Gordon , they have broad application to the best interests of the child.
6. 154 However, traditional considerations bearing on the best interests of the child must be considered in the context of the unique challenges posed by relocation cases. In addition to the factors that a court will

generally consider when determining the best interests of the child and any applicable notice requirements, a court should also consider:

* the reasons for the relocation;
* the impact of the relocation on the child;
* the amount of time spent with the child by each person who has parenting time or a pending application for a parenting order and the level of involvement in the child's life of each of those persons;
* the existence of an order, arbitral award, or agreement that specifies the geographic area in which the child is to reside;
* the reasonableness of the proposal of the person who intends to relocate the child to vary the exercise of parenting time, decision making responsibility or contact, taking into consideration, among other things, the location of the new place of residence and the travel expenses; and
* whether each person who has parenting time or decision-making responsibility or a pending application for a parenting order has complied with their obligations under family law legislation, an order, arbitral award, or agreement, and the likelihood of future compliance.

The court should not consider how the outcome of an application would affect either party's relocation plans -- for example, whether the person who intends to move with the child would relocate without the child or not relocate. These factors are drawn from s. 16.92(1) and (2) of the Divorce Act and largely reflect the evolution of the common law for over 25 years.

## Good Faith

- [16] The parties disagree as to whether or not C.L.M.'s proposed relocation is done in good faith. C.L.M. says the primary reason for the move is to enhance her career and educational opportunities, which will not only benefit her but will provide an indirect benefit to the children. A.D.M. says the proposed move is solely for C.L.M.'s own personal romantic benefit.
- [17] As set out in s. 69(6) of the Act, for the purposes of determining if the proposed relocation is made in good faith, the court must consider all relevant factors, including the following:

- (a) the reasons for the proposed relocation;
- (b) whether the proposed relocation is likely to enhance the general quality of life of the children and C.L.M., including increasing emotional well-being or financial or educational opportunities;
- (c) whether notice was given under s. 66; and
- (d) any restrictions on relocation contained in a written agreement or an order.

## (a) Proposed reasons for relocation

- [18] C.L.M. worked at [omitted for publication] for 15 years, 14 of which were spent at the Prince George branch. At the time of separation, she was employed as a [omitted for publication]. C.L.M. says she was paid a base salary of $96,000 at [omitted] plus bonuses, which amounted to $7,000 in 2023. Her 2023 reported income was $102,778.87. C.L.M. took a position with [omitted for publication] in Victoria as an [omitted for publication] in March 2024. This job pays a base salary of $122,500 plus a more lucrative bonus package based on sales and growth. C.L.M. says she expects to earn $50,013 in bonuses for 2024, for a total income of $172,113.
- [19] C.L.M. says that because she does not have an MBA she has limited opportunities for advancement with [omitted for publication]. At [omitted for publication], she would not be able to secure the kind of position she holds at [omitted for publication] without an MBA. In addition, the kind of position she currently holds at [omitted for publication] in Victoria is not available in Prince George, as [omitted for publication]'s commercial banking executives operate out of Vancouver or Kamloops.
- [20] C.L.M. says [omitted for publication] would also support her pursuing an MBA on the weekends at Royal Roads University while she worked, an opportunity not available to her in Prince George. She can start the MBA program as soon as September 2025.
- [21] C.L.M. signed the Separation Agreement on November 14, 2023. Under that Agreement, she pledged to buy-out A.D.M.'s share of the family home. I find that in October and November 2023, C.L.M. structured her financial and personal affairs so as to align with the parties' mutual expectation that she and the children would continue to reside in Prince George and exercise a shared parenting arrangement.

[22] I found C.L.M. to be somewhat vague in describing how she came to open negotiations with [omitted for publication] in Victoria. In her affidavit of October 28, 2024, she implies her job at [omitted for publication] was terminated, saying, 'at the time I left this job at [omitted for publication], they eliminated this position in Prince George which, prior to the onset of Covid-19, had always been located in Vancouver.' In crossexamination, C.L.M. claimed she only started looking for positions outside of Prince George when she was given notice from [omitted for publication] that her position was being transferred to Vancouver. She said her position at [omitted for publication] was based out of Vancouver and she had been able to work in Prince George during Covid restrictions under remote work protocols, but that [omitted for publication] expected her to move to Vancouver to continue in that position going forward.

[23] C.L.M. says the discussions with [omitted for publication] about changes to her position started one to two months before the Separation Agreement was negotiated, yet she negotiated terms in that Agreement consistent with an intention to continue living in Prince George at her current income. At the time the Separation Agreement was negotiated, C.L.M. made no mention of any anticipated adverse changes to her income or employment, which would have been highly relevant given the parties were negotiating the division of family assets including the family home; the assumption of family debts; child support; and parenting arrangements.

[24] C.L.M.'s evidence about her position at [omitted for publication] in Prince George changed when challenged in cross-examination. C.L.M.'s initial evidence in direct examination and her affidavit gave the impression she was forced to look for another job at the end of 2023 because she was losing her job at [omitted for publication]. At the commencement of cross-examination C.L.M. clarified she was not losing her job, but claims she would suffer a significant demotion to a possible bank teller position if she stayed. When challenged about agreeing to buy out the family home knowing her position at [omitted for publication] was being eliminated, C.L.M. acknowledged that [omitted for publication] was not eliminating her employment and that another position would be secured for her, although it may involve a demotion or 'transfer out of commercial banking.' By the end of cross-examination, C.L.M. conceded her position at

[omitted for publication] was not being eliminated but her opportunities for career advancement and pay were capped if she remained in Prince George.

[25] In her Application About a Family Law Matter filed April 24, 2024, C.L.M. outlines her reasons for moving to Victoria in terms of the superior pay and career opportunities offered by [omitted for publication]. She makes no reference to being forced to move because her employment in Prince George was being changed or eliminated.

[26] Despite adducing numerous confirmatory records from [omitted for publication] about the Victoria job, C.L.M. adduced no records from [omitted for publication] confirming her Prince George position was only a temporary remote position; that to continue she would have to move to Vancouver; or that she would no longer have a position at [omitted for publication] in Prince George. C.L.M. was a senior employee at [omitted for publication] holding a management position and had been at that bank for 15 years. Given her shifting evidence about the discussions with [omitted for publication]; I find it difficult to accept her evidence [omitted for publication] intended to unilaterally demote her and decrease her pay. I would expect any such proposal to be supported by written records. I draw an adverse inference from C.L.M.'s failure to produce any records from [omitted for publication] addressing any proposed changes to her position in Prince George.

[27] I am not satisfied C.L.M.'s income from her employment with [omitted for publication] was going to be reduced or eliminated if she remained in Prince George after the end of 2023.

[28] I also found C.L.M. to be less than candid about how she came to be in discussions with [omitted for publication] in Victoria, a city which happened to coincide with the city of residence of M.S.

[29] C.L.M. says her job at [omitted for publication] was being transferred to Vancouver, but she was not prepared to move to Vancouver because she did not want to raise her children there. She started looking for jobs in Victoria one to two months before the Separation Agreement was negotiated. She says she focused on Victoria in

particular because A.D.M. had previously expressed an interest in moving to Victoria, so it 'would not be an issue' for him to move as well. I found C.L.M.'s explanation incredulous. After separation she had no discussion whatsoever with A.D.M. about moving to Victoria and had no credible basis to believe he had any current interest in relocating. I find she focused on Victoria because that is where M.S. lived, not because she honestly believed A.D.M. would be keen to personally relocate there to continue the shared parenting arrangement.

- [30] I accept A.D.M.'s evidence that he had no idea C.L.M. was looking for work elsewhere or planning to relocate until he received a phone call from her on March 15, 2024, the same day she emailed her notice of intention to relocate. Up to that point following the execution of the Separation Agreement, the parties had been getting along well and cooperating on parenting matters such as planning birthday parties.
- [31] C.L.M. testified that in January 2024, a recruiter reached out to her to advise her of the [omitted for publication] opportunity. She claims she had not retained the recruiter or actively pursued jobs in Victoria. I find C.L.M. intended to give the impression that it was mere chance she was offered a job in Victoria, and she had not been actively looking for jobs to relocate to Victoria after signing the Separation Agreement.
- [32] C.L.M. adduced no communications from any alleged head-hunter to confirm her evidence. Her evidence on this point was directly contradicted by M.S., who testified that he knew C.L.M. to be actively looking for jobs outside of Prince George in the late winter of 2023, and that she was the one who initiated the application process with [omitted for publication].
- [33] After separation starting in March 2023, C.L.M. began spending one week a month with M.S. in Victoria. They vacationed together in Las Vegas. By August 2023, she was spending half of each month in Victoria. C.L.M. and M.S. went on a family vacation to Mexico with their children in January 2024. When C.L.M. moved to Victoria in March 2024 to start her new job, she immediately moved in with M.S. and they bought a $1.5 million home together within months.

[34] I do not believe C.L.M. was cold-called by a head hunter in January 2024 with a job opportunity that just so happened to be in Victoria, and that she took the opportunity because her position at [omitted for publication] was being eliminated. I find it more likely that by the summer of 2023 C.L.M. was looking into job opportunities in Victoria with the intention of moving there to pursue a relationship with M.S. She concealed her intentions from A.D.M. because she was eager to settle the division of assets between the parties so she could organize her financial affairs in order to move. C.L.M.'s evidence spoke to her sense of urgency to finalize the parties' financial affairs in the late fall of 2023.

[35] C.L.M. says another factor in her reason for moving to Victoria was her belief that A.D.M. also wanted to move there based on discussions they had during their marriage. I put no weight on that evidence. After the parties separated in October 2022, there was no discussion about A.D.M. moving to Victoria. He has no family, job, or connections there. All his supports are in Prince George. I find it dubious C.L.M. was operating under the misapprehension that based on musings the parties had years earlier while still a couple, A.D.M. shared her desire to relocate.

[36] C.L.M. implies she was forced to enter into the Separation Agreement in November 2023 under economic duress due to her dire financial circumstances. She purports to blame some of her circumstances on A.D.M., who she complains failed to make RESP contributions or pay half the childcare expenses after separation as agreed. I find no merit in this complaint. The RESP contribution was only $100 per month, and A.D.M. contributes that in a separate account. A.D.M. offset his half of the childcare expenses against interest-only payments on a line of credit that C.L.M. was responsible to pay but was being paid by him. In the months preceding the execution of the Separation Agreement, C.L.M. was flying back and forth to Victoria every other week and vacationing with M.S. I do not believe she was financially desperate.

[37] I find C.L.M.'s primary reason for moving to Victoria was to pursue her relationship with M.S. Her secondary reason was to pursue a better job with a view to upgrading her education.

- [38] Although I am of the view the primary motivating factor for the move was to pursue her relationship with M.S., this does not necessarily equate to bad faith. C.L.M.'s reasons for moving are still valid personal reasons and are not for the purpose of interfering with A.D.M.'s relationship with the children.
2. (b) Whether the proposed relocation is likely to enhance the general quality of life of the children and C.L.M., including increasing emotional well-being or financial or educational opportunities
- [39] The proposed relocation will enhance the quality of life for C.L.M. I accept that being able to live with M.S. will increase her emotional well-being. Her new position at [omitted for publication] increases her financial opportunities, although the net impact of that increase is somewhat attenuated by the higher cost of living in Victoria. The family home in Prince George was valued at $449,545. C.L.M. and M.S.'s new home in Victoria cost $1.5 million.
- [40] There was no evidence led about options to pursue an MBA in Prince George through the University of Northern British Columbia ('UNBC') or another institution. C.L.M.'s evidence was that during the marriage the parties always intended she would get her MBA. There was no suggestion it was contemplated she would move to Victoria or elsewhere to pursue her education. C.L.M. says her employer, [omitted for publication], would provide support for her pursuit of an MBA, and this would provide enhanced access to education. It was not clear from C.L.M.s' evidence whether [omitted for publication] would pay for some or part of her MBA course or if it would just allow her time off work to attend courses. Nonetheless, I accept that support from her employer does provide an increased educational opportunity for C.L.M.
- [41] Despite some gaps in the evidence, I accept that the ability to live with M.S. coupled with the more lucrative position at [omitted for publication] and increased access to an MBA program enhances C.L.M.'s financial and emotional well-being and provides her increased educational opportunities.
- [42] I am not satisfied the proposed move would directly enhance the children's quality of life, emotional or financial well-being. The children have no relationship with

M.S. or his children other than the few times they have met in conjunction with C.L.M.'s exercise of parenting time. While C.L.M. reports they all get along well, there has been insufficient time and exposure for the children to have developed any meaningful attachment to M.S. and his family.

[43] I am also not satisfied the proposed move would directly increase the children's quality of life, financial or educational opportunities. Victoria and Prince George both offer the same amenities in terms of access to a very broad range of extra-curricular activities, including the ones currently enjoyed by the children, namely hockey, baseball, dance, skiing, skating, swimming and gymnastics. The children also participate in outdoor wilderness activities and sports with their father, such as camping and skiing, which are more readily accessible in Prince George.

[44] There is no evidence to suggest the children would enjoy a superior learning experience at a Victoria elementary school than they would at [omitted for publication] Elementary School. The children do not have special needs or gifts which would benefit from a specialized education environment only available in Victoria. C.L.M. says if the children move to Victoria, they can go to the same school as M.S.'s children in the French immersion program. Prince George offers multiple French immersion school options which Mr. and C.L.M. chose to forego when registering the children for school. Neither the children nor the parents have a French background and the children have no French education to date. It is M.S. who hails from France.

[45] C.L.M. submits the children would benefit from an increased standard of living in Victoria due to her and M.S.'s combined superior income. She points out they recently purchased a large six bedroom home while A.D.M. continues to reside in a twobedroom basement suite. A.D.M. says he has been waiting for the outcome of this proceeding before securing a long-term residence, which I accept. It stands to reason that a parent would need to know whether or not the children will be living with them full time during the school year before choosing a home, given factors such as size, location and school catchment would flow from that decision.

[46] A.D.M. earns around $100,000 annually as a biologist. He is able to provide the children with a comfortable standard of living and meet all of their needs, while enriching their development with sports and extra-curricular activities. The increased financial opportunities offered by C.L.M.'s new position may translate into increased luxuries for the children, but does not necessarily materially increase their quality of life. Whether they live in Prince George or Victoria, the children will reside in comfortable and stable homes, attend good schools, and enjoy enriching life experiences and pastimes.

[47] In Barendregt , the court held a relocation that provides a parent with more education, employment opportunities and economic stability could contribute to a child's well-being: para. 171. It is often difficult to disentangle the interests of a parent from the interests of a child, and the nurture of children is inextricably linked with the well-being of the nurturing parent: para. 173.

[48] C.L.M. has already relocated and already enjoys the increased education, employment opportunities and relationship benefits of living in Victoria, whether or not the children are relocated. It is not suggested, nor does the court have any authority, to order C.L.M. to live in Prince George. To the extent the benefits of living in Victoria enhance C.L.M.'s well-being, that enhancement also benefits the children regardless of where they live. Her increased salary still benefits the children in the form of increased child support and C.L.M.'s ability to contribute more generously to their extra-curricular activities and luxury experiences such as vacations. Her happiness in her new partnership will radiate to the children during her parenting time.

[49] This is not a case where C.L.M. has primary care of the children and A.D.M. only exercises weekend or periodic parenting time. These are parents with equal parenting time and equal investment in the children. In this situation where one parent has relocated and the children can only live in one community, one of the parents will enjoy having the children in their primary care and the other will have to bear the loss of no longer enjoying regular care of the children. The happiness of the successful parent will necessarily be at the cost of the unsuccessful parent. The children's interests are intertwined with both parents, so they will feel the joy and pain of both. Neither parent

has a superior claim to their happiness being of greater import to the children's wellbeing than the other. There is no 'great respect' principle in favour of one parent in a shared parenting arrangement: Barendregt , at par. 119. To the contrary, the court says at para. 121:

But over time, certain patterns have emerged. In practice, a move is more likely to be approved where the clear primary caregiver for a child seeks to relocate and more likely to be denied if there is a shared parenting arrangement. Professor Thompson refers to this as the unspoken "primary caregiver presumption": see D. A. R. Thompson, "Ten Years After Gordon : No Law, Nowhere" (2007), 35 R.F.L. (6th) 307, at p. 317; R. Thompson, "Where Is B.C. Law Going? The New Mobility" (2012), 30 C.F.L.Q. 235.

- [50] Barendregt does not stand for the proposition that in a relocation case where the court has to choose between two equal, loving, caring parents, the court should only consider the trickle-down effect of the relocating parent's happiness while ignoring the trickle-down effect of the remaining parent's loss. Where there are two nurturing parents, the children's interests are intertwined with both of them.
- [51] In Barendregt, the court found it was in the children's best interests to relocate with their mother in circumstances where the father had assaulted and emotionally traumatized the mother was abusive and profoundly offensive to her at trial, and there was compelling evidence of the father's continuing animosity towards her. The children would be negatively impacted by the parents remaining in the same locale, which favoured granting the relocation. The judge also had concerns about the father's ability to retain his residence, which required extensive repairs, and concluded the mother was more likely to foster a positive attitude in the children towards their father than the converse. The court affirmed that family violence is an important factor in mobility cases. It is not a factor in this case.
- [52] In M.D.G. v. C.J.G., 2016 BCPC 298, Judge Marchand (as he then was) found the relocating mother had not acted in good faith in circumstances where the proposed move was to be with a new partner which would enhance her life, but not necessarily the child's. There were additional negative factors not present in this case, however,

including the mother's failure to provide notice, lack of transparency about her reasons for moving, failure to propose workable arrangements and breaching the spirit of a nonrelocation order.

[53] While the proposed move would enhance C.L.M.s' emotional and financial wellbeing and her quality of life, it would not have a net increase on the children's quality of life or emotional or financial well-being. This weighs against a finding of good faith.

## (c) Whether notice was given under s. 66

[54] C.L.M. did provide notice of her intention to relocate the children as required on March 15, 2024, and took no steps to move them pending the outcome of this hearing. This weighs in favour of a finding of good faith.

## (d) Any restrictions on relocation contained in a written agreement or an order

[55] The Separation Agreement, which was signed by both parties effective November 8, 2023, provides that 'all matters in dispute between them', including family property, 'have been settled to his or her satisfaction,' and that if either spouse 'makes or pursues a claim against the other, this Agreement shall form the basis of a consent order in those proceedings, so as to maintain the full force and effect of this Agreement.'

[56] The Separation Agreement between the parties does not explicitly address the issue of relocation. However, I find such an agreement is necessarily implied by its terms. The Agreement provides for a shared parenting arrangement on an alternating weekly basis. At the time the Agreement was signed both children were attending school. It would have been virtually impossible for the negotiated shared parenting regime to be followed if one parent purported to relocate the children to another city during their parenting time. Children cannot attend schools in different cities on an alternating weekly basis. The Agreement necessarily contemplates the children will remain in Prince George. This Agreement was entered into only five months before C.L.M. provided notice of her intention to relocate.

[57] Nothing in the Separation Agreement restricts the parties from relocating. C.L.M. has relocated but the children have not, pending the outcome of this hearing. C.L.M. has incurred great expense and inconvenience in an effort to preserve the current shared parenting regime without disturbing the children's place of residence. She is not in the same position as the relocating parent in L.J.R. v. S.W.R., 2013 BCSC 1344, who moved the children to Tennessee in contravention of an interim non-relocation order, a circumstance the court found to be a 'significant factor weighing against a finding of good faith.'

[58] In Hadjioannou v. Hadjioannou, 2013 BCSC 1682, however, the court found the relocation was not being made in good faith where the mother had moved to Medicine Hat mid-trial, despite leaving the children in the father's care in their home community of the Sunshine Coast. An order for joint custody was made in the parties' divorce proceedings in January 2013. Two months later the mother gave the father written notice of her intention to relocate the children, citing her new partner's move to Alberta to secure employment, as well as increased supports available from his family. She proposed a parenting time schedule with the father similar to that proposed by C.L.M. The father objected and filed an application to prohibition relocation in March. The mother relocated with her new spouse to Medicine Hat in June.

[59] The mother's financial circumstances had not really changed and in fact there had been 'some improvement' since trial, which the court found 'suggested a lack of good faith' with respect to the reasons for relocating. The court concluded the mother's main reason for moving was to follow her new partner, who attested to needing to find work to support his own children. To that the judge said at paras. 56-57:

56 …In wanting to follow Mr. Bazinet to Alberta, the mother acknowledges the importance of his obligations to support his children, with which I take no issue, but does not seem to consider the best interests of her own children. She deposed (at para. 27 of her affidavit of June 10, 2013):

... He had no choice but to look elsewhere for work. He also has his children to provide for and that's the most important priority.

I am assuming she means that is the most important priority for him.

- 57 Given all of this evidence, I find that the mother's reasons for the relocation, when considered with the circumstances surrounding her decision and the timing of it in relation to the trial and the trial judge's decision, weigh against a finding of good faith.
- [60] In this case, M.S.'s shared parenting arrangement with his former spouse is cited as a major factor why he cannot move to Prince George to be with C.L.M. He says there are limited job opportunities for him in his line of work, but offered no evidence of what inquiries he made, if any, of any efforts to seek employment here.
- [61] C.L.M. started spending half of the month with M.S. in Victoria after A.D.M. moved out and they commenced the alternating weekly parenting arrangement. She was contemplating moving from Prince George months prior to negotiating the Separation Agreement yet made no mention of this to A.D.M. She started looking for jobs outside of Prince George within weeks of signing the Separation Agreement and applied to [omitted for publication] within a couple of months. She made no mention of her intentions until she provided her formal notice of intention to relocate on March 15, 2024. This weighs against a finding of good faith.

## Has C.L.M. Proposed Reasonable and Workable Arrangements to Preserve the Relationship Between the Children and Their Father, as well as any Other Persons who Have a Significant Role in the Children's Life?

[62] C.L.M. proposes that if the children were to relocate to Victoria, A.D.M. would have parenting time on school breaks and long weekends. Prince George and Victoria are almost 900 km apart. As Victoria is on an Island, road travel requires a 90-minute ferry ride. It takes around 11-12 hours each way to drive between the two communities. There are multiple flights each day from Prince George which provide access to Victoria, including one direct flight. As the children are still quite young, flight travel may necessitate accompaniment by a parent.

[63] In short, transporting the children between the parents is very time consuming, inconvenient and costly, rendering frequent short visits infeasible. Any exercise of parenting time would more realistically be structured for longer blocks of time during the year with less frequency.

[64] C.L.M. proposed a parenting schedule whereby the children would live with her and spend spring break, one week of Christmas break, four days at Easter, and six weeks of the summer holiday with A.D.M. This would be augmented by A.D.M. having 4-5 days of parenting time each month around statutory holidays or non-instructional days.

[65] The proposed plan does provide regular monthly parenting time for A.D.M., but would require the children to miss a couple of days of school in some months. The plan may also impact the children's participation in extra-curricular activities and would necessitate significant travel costs. Given the distances, the only feasible way for the children to travel for shorter blocks of parenting time is by air. The children must be a minimum of eight years old to fly as unaccompanied minors, which adds a cost of $100 or more per ticket, and a parent would be required to fly with E.P.M. until she turns eight. There are regular daily flights between Prince George and Victoria, including some direct flights.

[66] C.L.M. has proposed A.D.M.'s child support payments be reduced to 70% of the table amount to help offset the cost of travel, and that she would bear 75% of the children's travel costs. She also proposes A.D.M. can have additional parenting time in Victoria any time he wishes.

[67] The proposed arrangement does provide for some generous blocks of parenting time in Prince George and financial contribution from C.L.M. It is reasonable and workable. This weighs in favour of a finding of good faith.

## Conclusions on Whether the Proposed Move is Made in Good Faith

[68] The proposed relocation is almost solely for C.L.M.'s benefit. The children live comfortable, secure, enriched lives in Prince George surrounded by extended family and friends. Both parents are professionals earning generous wages, all of their health needs are met, they attend a good school and there are a wealth of activities available to them for their personal development. There is no circumstance or change in circumstance which makes it necessary to move, such as a job loss, loss of child care

support or loss of housing. The proposed city of relocation, Victoria, does not offer enhanced opportunities critical to the children's development or needs that are not already available in Prince George. There is no need to escape family violence.

[69] In conclusion, I find that in desiring to relocate, C.L.M.'s motives are driven solely by her own romantic and career interests, not a genuine perceived advantage to the children. She wishes to relocate the children because she does not want to be parted from them, not because the children's quality of life or well-being will improve by leaving Prince George in favour of Victoria.

[70] As set out above, there are factors weighing for and against a finding of good faith. C.L.M. has compelling personal reasons for wishing to move, she gave notice as required, and she proposed workable arrangements for A.D.M.'s parenting time. However, her reasons for moving are primarily for her own benefit and not to improve the children's quality of life, and she made plans to move on the heels of Separation Agreement, which implicitly prevented the children from relocating.

[71] On balance, I find these latter factors tip the balance towards a finding that the proposed relocation is not made in good faith.

## Is the Relocation is in the Children's Best Interests?

[72] Because the parties enjoy a shared parenting arrangement, C.L.M. must satisfy the court that the proposed relocation is in the children's best interests. Even where a proposed relocation is not made in good faith, the court must still consider whether the proposed relocation is in the best interests of the child: C.M.B. v. B.D.G. , 2014 BCSC 780 at para. 64. Accordingly, despite my conclusion that the proposed relocation is not made in good faith, this is far from determinative, especially considering there are a number of indicators of good faith and the balance tips only slightly towards an adverse finding. The paramount consideration is the best interests of the children.

## [73] Section 37 of the FLA provides:

- 37(1)  In making an agreement or order under this Part respecting guardianship, parenting arrangements or contact with a child, the parties and the court must consider the best interests of the child only.
- (2) To determine what is in the best interests of a child, all of the child's needs and circumstances must be considered, including the following:
- (a) the child's health and emotional well-being;
- (b) the child's views, unless it would be inappropriate to consider them;
- (c) the nature and strength of the relationships between the child and significant persons in the child's life;
- (d) the history of the child's care;
- (e) the child's need for stability, given the child's age and stage of development;
- (f) the ability of each person who is a guardian or seeks guardianship of the child, or who has or seeks parental responsibilities, parenting time or contact with the child, to exercise the person's responsibilities;
- (g) the impact of any family violence on the child's safety, security or well-being, whether the family violence is directed toward the child or another family member;
- (h) whether the actions of a person responsible for family violence indicate that the person may be impaired in the person's ability to care for the child and meet the child's needs;
- (i) the appropriateness of an arrangement that would require the child's guardians to cooperate on issues affecting the child, including whether requiring cooperation would increase any risks to the safety, security or well-being of the child or other family members;
- (j) any civil or criminal proceeding relevant to the child's safety, security or well-being.
- (3) An agreement or order is not in the best interests of a child unless it protects, to the greatest extent possible, the child's physical, psychological and emotional safety, security and well-being.
- [74] C.L.M. argues she was the de facto primary caregiver of the children during the marriage. She relies on case authorities where the children were permitted to relocate with the parent who exercised the majority of parenting time. However, Mr. and C.L.M.

have exercised a shared parenting arrangement since separation. That shared parenting arrangement is legally formalized in the parties' Separation Agreement and has been diligently followed by both parties for over two years. It would be inappropriate to approach the issue as if C.L.M. were the primary caregiver with the majority of parenting time. Cases where the court allowed the primary parent to relocate with the children are of less assistance given the 'great respect' principle does not operate in this case.

## (a) The child's health and emotional well-being

[75] Both children are physically healthy. A.D.M. describes E.P.M. as an emotionally resilient child. She does well in school and makes friends easily. E.P.M. does not have any emotional or psychological concerns that weigh in favour of or against relocation.

[76] E.A.M. has experienced separation anxiety since he was very young. C.L.M. says E.A.M. is uniquely attached to her and that he becomes distressed from being separated from her. She says this weighs in favour of allowing the children to relocate because, if they remain in Prince George, E.A.M. will suffer from being separated from her for longer periods of time.

[77] A.D.M. does not disagree that E.A.M. has demonstrated some anxiety when being separated from C.L.M., but points out E.A.M.'s anxiety is not unique to his separation from her. E.A.M. has expressed anxiety when being dropped off at school regardless of which caregiver was involved, be it himself or even the grandparents. Over time, this behaviour has improved and E.A.M. is becoming less emotional as he becomes more attached to his peer group. E.A.M.'s separation anxiety was exacerbated by the break-up of the family, but over the past couple of years, he has adjusted.

[78] C.L.M. arranged for some sessions of play therapy for E.A.M. to help with his anxiety, which A.D.M. supported. A.D.M. fairly concedes the play therapy was intended specifically to address E.A.M.'s experience of anxiety when separating from his mother.

Counselling is available at E.A.M.'s school in Prince George, as well as the school C.L.M. proposes to transfer E.A.M. to in Victoria.

[79] As E.A.M. matures, his anxiety has reduced. Since December 2024, there has only been one incident where E.A.M. expressed anxiety during an exchange. E.A.M.'s December 2024 Learning Update discloses he is doing well both academically and socially and is proficient in every subject area. He is described as 'kind, polite and considerate of others in the classroom.'

[80] I accept A.D.M.'s evidence that as E.A.M. matures and transitions to having stronger attachments to his peer group, his anxiety at school drop-offs has diminished. This has developed over a period of years of attending the same school with the same teachers, friends and peers. E.A.M. has a close school friend he has known for five years since day care. His hockey coach is a family friend.

[81] I find E.A.M.'s psychological and emotional needs make him particularly sensitive to change. E.A.M. is now nine years old. As E.A.M. continues to mature, his relationships with same-age peers will take on greater importance to being in the immediate presence of his parents. E.A.M.'s anxiety of being separated from his caregivers has waned as E.A.M. shifts his emotional attachment to his friends and peers. It would be unusual for an 11 or 12 year old child to experience separation anxiety from a parent, although not unusual for a child of that age to experience anxiety at being introduced to new persons, places, or experiences.

[82] If E.A.M. is relocated, he will be removed from all that is familiar and safe for him - his school, team, classmates, friends and familiar adults. This separation is likely to impact his anxiety in a way not offset by the emotional comfort E.A.M. may gain from having more access to his mother. I would expect a relocation to be emotionally difficult for him. This factor weighs against permitting relocation.

## (b) The child's views, unless it would be inappropriate to consider them

- [83] Given the young ages of the children, their views were not canvassed or adduced in evidence. The children would be incapable of appreciating what a relocation would entail and it would not be appropriate to consider their views on that subject.
- [84] I find the children are close to both of their parents. C.L.M. suggests the children are emotionally more attached to her, especially E.A.M. She points out that E.A.M. experiences separation anxiety from her when he is taken to school or exchanged with A.D.M., which she asserts is evidence of his superior emotional attachment to her.
- [85] For his part, A.D.M. says E.A.M. misses him when they are apart. Both children often call him during C.L.M.'s parenting time to talk and tell him that they miss him.
- [86] Based on the evidence before me, I conclude the children love and are attached to both their parents. It will be difficult for the children to be separated from either of them.

## (c) The nature and strength of the relationships between the child and significant persons in the child's life

[87] The children are very attached to their maternal grandparents, who have been closely involved in the children's lives since birth. The children often stay over at their grandparents' home and visit regularly. C.L.M.'s mother took a part-time position at the children's after-school care provider to spend even more time with them. Prior to separation the children were at their grandparents' house almost every afternoon, and they all went on a family holiday to Mexico together. Post-separation the maternal grandparents continue to attend the children's birthdays, Christmas, school, sporting and local events during A.D.M.'s parenting time at his invitation. The grandparents have routinely provided childcare since the children were very young. Since separation, the grandparents have provided a lot of childcare support for A.D.M. during his parenting time, including when he has weekly search and rescue training.

[88] The grandparents did not testify in this proceeding. I infer they wish to avoid taking sides and seek to preserve their relationships with both parents in the best interests of their grandchildren.

[89] C.L.M. says that if the children are permitted to relocate, she will preserve their relationship with their grandparents by bringing the children to visit during her parenting time, or hosting her parents in Victoria when they come to visit. I find this would be a significant reduction in contact from what the children currently enjoy with their grandparents, who they typically see multiple times a week.

[90] The children also have a relationship with their maternal aunt and her spouse who live in Mackenzie, around a 2.5 hours' drive from Prince George. They come to Prince George regularly and stay with the children's maternal grandparents.

[91] A.D.M. says the children are also very attached to their after-school caregiver who they have known since they were very young. If they were relocated the children would have little contact with this person. In addition, the children's maternal great grandfather lives with their maternal grandparents and is another important figure in their lives, although I accept that due to his health conditions he is not as involved and connected with the children as the grandparents.

[92] The children have close friends at school. E.A.M. is close to his hockey teammates and coach. Those relationships would be significantly diminished if the children relocated, as their day-to-day contact with these friends would be reduced to occasional contact through pre-arranged play dates during A.D.M.'s school break parenting time.

[93] There are no important persons in the children's life resident in Victoria other than their mother. I do not consider their relationship with M.S. or his children to be significant. The children have spent a small amount of time with M.S. on a few occasions - once during a short holiday and a few times during C.L.M.'s parenting time. I am sceptical of C.L.M.'s claim the children have 'bonded' with M.S.'s children given their limited contact; namely, some time together on a short family vacation and the few

times the children have spent time with their mother in Victoria that also coincided with M.S.'s parenting time.

[94] C.L.M. has a free place to stay in Prince George with her parents. She can easily spend additional time with the children in Prince George outside of her scheduled parenting time. By contrast, A.D.M. has no connection in Victoria, and would have to pay for accommodations should he wish to visit the children there.

[95] To the extent it would be ideal for both parents to attend important events and milestones in the children's lives, such as festivals, recitals, competitions, graduations, etc., that is far more easily accomplished if the children reside in Prince George. The children are more likely to have more contact with both parents if they remain in Prince George, which would be in their best interests.

## (d) The history of the child's care;

[96] Caring for a child involves an almost infinite number of duties, actions, words, and thoughts. A child needs financial support, food, education, attention, socialization, medical care, enriching activities, hygiene, stimulation, discipline, guidance, and healthy integration into the broad scope of the human experience.

[97] All too often in parenting time disputes the inquiry can devolve into a competition of which parent 'cared more' for the child during the relationship. This exercise can become painstaking and lengthy as the parties dissect the entire experience of caring for a child into minute tasks which are then subjected to an esoteric statistical analysis. This methodology of establishing the 'history of the child's care' can be problematic when the parents lived together with the children as a family.

[98] When parents are together, they often care for their children as a team, dividing different tasks relating to the child's care between them. The reasons for this are obvious. A child does not simultaneously need two baths, two dinners, or two diapers. It makes sense that one parent might assume some aspects of the child's care while the other parent assumes others. The division of the child's care may reflect the parents'

respective availability around their work hours or reflect their individual areas of expertise or interest.

[99] It is difficult when the court is called upon to weigh the relative contributions two involved parents have made to their child's care in an effort to identify who was a 'primary' caregiver prior to separation. One parent may assume much of the physical care of the children during the day and the other parent assumes that care at night after work. One may do all the feeding of the children, while the other does all the driving. One may bear the uncomfortable task of meting out discipline while the other organizes most of the play. One may be in charge of the child's extra-curricular activities while the other deals with medical professionals. One may do bath time and the other the bedtime story. One may organize the child's play dates while the other takes them fishing and camping. The list is potentially endless, and it is daunting to require the court to delve into each precise aspect of a child's care, assign a measure of value to it, and weigh it against others.

[100] In my view, where two parents lived together with the children as a family, and the evidence shows both were actively involved in the children's lives, it makes no sense to speak of one parent being a 'primary caregiver' and the other being 'secondary.' They were co-parents, and stand in the same position as separated parents in a shared parenting arrangement.

[101] There may be situations where two parents are living with the children as a family, but the evidence shows one was significantly more involved in the children's lives than the other. For example, a parent who is physically absent from the home for most weeks of the month for work, or spends a lot of their free time away from the family pursuing their own interests, or who isolates themselves from the family despite sharing the same home, is likely not co-parenting the children.

[102] The parties were both actively involved in the children's lives prior to separation. After each child's birth, C.L.M. took maternity leave, following which A.D.M. took three months of paternity leave. A.D.M. would take time off work to provide physical care of the children when they could not attend school or day care due to illness or closures.

Both parents would get up with the children in the middle of the night when they were infants. Each parent would cuddle one of the children and do their bedtime routine. They both picked up and dropped off the children for day care before and after work. When A.D.M. was home working on his master's degree he did most of the pick-ups and drop-offs while C.L.M. worked to support the family. A.D.M. would play with the children while C.L.M. cooked dinner.

[103] C.L.M. manages doctor appointments because the children are patients of her personal physician. A.D.M. has dealt with the children's dental needs and haircuts. A.D.M. likes the outdoors and physical activity, so he spends a lot of time with the children swimming, biking, and walking. A.D.M. also provides opportunities for the children to connect with nature through fishing, camping and backpacking.

[104] C.L.M. historically has been primarily responsible for registering the children in their extra-curricular activities, but both parents take them to those activities. A.D.M. took a ski instructor's course and taught both children to ski, an activity they continue to regularly pursue. A.D.M. has acted as a ski chaperone for E.P.M. in the Nancy Greene program. Currently E.P.M. is in gymnastics and figure skating and E.A.M. is in hockey. Both children are in skating lessons and ski in the winter. Both are in swimming lessons. A.D.M. has completed the requisite courses to be on the ice as an assistant coach for E.A.M.'s hockey team.

[105] A.D.M. reads to the children every night and, since separation, has attended all parent-teacher interviews. C.L.M. says before separation she attended all school related functions and A.D.M. did not.

[106] In cross-examination, C.L.M. conceded that during the marriage when A.D.M. was not working out of town they shared care of the children. Initially C.L.M. attempted to give the impression A.D.M. was frequently absent from the home working in camp or in the field; however, she changed her evidence when confronted with his work records in cross-examination. She agreed after E.P.M. was born, A.D.M. changed his position to an administrative one that required far less time in the field. In fact, A.D.M. has only spent 7-13 days per year working out of town since the children were born. C.L.M., for

26

her part, also worked out of town from time to time to attend [omitted for publication] functions, during which time A.D.M. exclusively cared for the children. For the two years, A.D.M. was working on his master's degree he was mostly at home. He accepted more camp work during a two month period in early 2023 when the parties were separated but still sharing the family home as a means of reducing tensions in the home. He assumed greater care of the children on his weeks off during that short period.

[107] The parties' periodic out of town work commitments does not affect the balance of their respective contributions to the children's care during the marriage. I conclude the parties shared care of the children during the marriage and there was no 'primary' and 'secondary' parent in the family.

## (e) The child's need for stability, given the child's age and stage of development

[108] The children are young and their need for stability is high. I accept A.D.M.'s evidence the children found the break-up of the family 'traumatic' and it was initially very hard on them to go from living with both parents to an alternating weekly parenting arrangement. He advises that with the passage of time they have adjusted to this new reality and are doing well now. If relocation is permitted, this will be the second major upheaval in the children's lives in two and a half years, and the change will be even more dramatic given they will be moving from their community entirely, not just changing the amount of time they are in the care of each parent.

[109] Both parents work, so the children require care during the summer months and after school. Both children have been enrolled in the same afterschool care program for years - E.A.M. since 2021 and E.P.M. since 2023. This program also offers summer care, which both children attended in 2024. A.D.M. says both children continue to have priority access to enrolment in this afterschool and summer care program as existing clients. The children have friends in this program, including some of their school friends. Staying in Prince George would provide continuity of care with respect to after school and summer care. By contrast, if relocated to Victoria, C.L.M. would have to secure new

after-school and summer care options for the children. She has adduced no evidence of what programs would have availability to register the children.

[110] If the children are not relocated and A.D.M. is awarded primary parenting time, he proposes to keep the children in [omitted for publication] Elementary regardless of where he secures a new family residence. He would continue to work with the children's maternal grandparents for care and provide them regular contact. He would preserve the relationships the children have with their friends and former caregiver. They would continue to attend their extra-curricular activities with their current programs, coaches, and teammates.

[111] Given the distance between the parents, the change from shared to a primary/secondary parenting regime is inevitable regardless of whether or not the children are permitted to relocate. However if the children are not relocated, the rhythm of the children's day-to-day lives would remain constant and provide a measure of familiarity and continuity in the face of that change.

[112] By contrast, the proposed relocation would be an enormous change for the children. They would be moving into a home with a new authority figure they barely know. C.L.M. admits that she would rely on M.S. to provide care for the children, which would be significant if she moves forward with her plans to obtain an MBA on her days off from work. Every other week they would have to share their home with two older children they also barely know. They would go from being the only children in the home under the care and authority of their parents and grandparents, to being in a blended family in a new city with a new step-father and step-siblings. They would be attending a new school which may also involve them moving into an entirely new program, French Immersion, with which they have no history or experience. They would go from having generous regular contact with important third parties in their lives to having no one but their mother, who will be away a lot of the time working or getting her MBA. They would have to join new teams and enter new extra-curricular programs, and make new friends. Every aspect of their lives would be disrupted.

[113] The children's need for stability favours their continuous residence in Prince George.

- (f)  The ability of each person who is a guardian or seeks guardianship of the child, or who has or seeks parental responsibilities, parenting time or contact with the child, to exercise his or her responsibilities;
- [114] Historically both parents have been involved in caring for the children and have proven to be responsible, devoted parents capable of exercising their parental responsibilities. C.L.M. suggests she has superior capabilities because in the past she has arranged or attended medical appointments for the children more often than A.D.M. I put little weight in that submission. As set out above, it is not appropriate to reduce the care of children to a statistical exercise where every aspect of their care is itemized and subjected to a mathematical calculation in order to determine who the more 'caring' parent is. The question is really whether, on a holistic level, both parents are contributing to the children's care, or if one is doing most of the work.
- [115] As is the case with assuming physical care of the children, it is not uncommon for parents to approach the exercise of parental responsibilities as a team, with each assuming responsibility for different aspects of the children's lives. For example, during the marriage one might take responsibility for all the children's medical and dental appointments while the other deals with all of their sports commitments. One might deal with all matters relating to school because they have favourable work hours, while the other may do all the after-work driving and organization relating to play dates and sleepovers. One may assume responsibility for all discipline and monitoring the children's screen time and internet usage, while the other helps with all their homework and school projects. In such scenarios, it is not appropriate to presume the parent who did not undertake a particular parental responsibility was and will be incapable of exercising it when required.
- [116] The court should not confuse a voluntary division of parental responsibilities during the marriage with parental incompetence or indifference. Rather, the court should consider the extent to which both parents contributed to the children's educational, financial, physical and developmental needs, broadly defined, and determine if the

parent historically disengaged from a particular parental responsibility can be trusted to assume that new responsibility during their parenting time.

[117] C.L.M. complains the children were late to school a few times during A.D.M.'s parenting time. He makes the same complaint about her. C.L.M. also took the children out of school for six days in January 2024 to take them to Mexico with M.S. and his children. The children's school records show they are doing well and there is no concerning pattern of absences or tardiness.

[118] Both parents attend various school functions and events and both attend to the children's medical needs during their respective parenting time. Both get the children to their extra-curricular activities and A.D.M. volunteers as a chaperone or assistant for some of them.

[119] Both parties speak to their respective employers being flexible and accommodating their parental obligations. They both work office hours, would rely on after-school care, and be available to care for the children after work.

[120] I am confident both parents are able to exercise their parental responsibilities competently and in the children's best interests. They have been exercising a shared parenting arrangement for over two years during which time the children's medical, educational and developmental needs have been met by both parents. I would not expect that to change regardless of whether or not the children were relocated. Although C.L.M. may be less capable of caring for the children once she starts her MBA program, I expect she would exercise her parental responsibility to arrange for safe and appropriate childcare, including if that provider is M.S.

[121] C.L.M. complains A.D.M. is less available to care for the children or exercise his parental responsibilities because he volunteers for the Prince George Search and Rescue Society. She is critical his involvement in this organization requires training once per week, requiring the children to be in their grandparents' care. She also argues A.D.M. puts himself at risk of harm by engaging in search and rescue missions, which puts the children indirectly at risk due to the potential injury or death of their caregiver.

- [122] C.L.M.'s complaints about A.D.M.'s participation in search and rescue are unwarranted. Parents who make valuable volunteer contributions to their community set good examples for their children on how to become civic-minded adults. Training for a few hours once a week does not significantly detract from the children's care, especially considering the children spend that time with their grandparents. I found C.L.M.'s criticisms unfair considering her plan was to spend many hours of her week taking an MBA course, leaving the children in the care of M.S. Further, I accept A.D.M.'s evidence that this is a volunteer position and he can decline to participate as and when required to meet his parental obligations. C.L.M. provided no authority for the proposition that parents who participate in dangerous vocations, such as firefighters, police officers, or military personnel, are less capable of exercising their parental responsibilities because of their increased risk of injury or death.
- [123] The parties' respective ability to exercise their parental responsibilities is a neutral factor in the analysis.

## (g) The impact of any family violence

- [124] Family violence is not alleged and is not a factor present in this proceeding.
2. (i) The appropriateness of an arrangement that would require the child's guardians to cooperate on issues affecting the child, including whether requiring cooperation would increase any risks to the safety, security or well-being of the child or other family members
- [125] C.L.M. complains she and A.D.M. do not communicate or cooperate well. On October 29, 2024, two weeks before the first trial date, C.L.M. made a complaint to the Ministry of Child and Family Development ('MCFD') which MCFD characterized as 'a likelihood of physical harm and neglect with a likelihood of physical harm' to the children while in A.D.M.'s care.
- [126] C.L.M. says around six months before she made the call to MCFD, the children told her A.D.M. spanks them and locks them in their room. She did not make a report at that time. She says she called and made a complaint on October 29, 2024 when the children told her A.D.M. had left them alone in the home, prompting her to report both

concerns. Before calling MCFD, she did not talk to A.D.M. about what the children allegedly told her, even though she had never witnessed A.D.M. use physical discipline on the children during the marriage.

[127] A.D.M. says that one morning he ran out for five minutes to get milk in order to make the children pancakes at their request. He was 500 metres away and there were upstairs tenants in the same building. The children were not in imminent danger. He never used physical discipline or confinement of the children. He explained this in an email to C.L.M.

[128] As a result of C.L.M.'s report, MCFD put a safety plan into place, opened an investigation and interviewed both children at their school. They inspected A.D.M.'s home and sought information from collaterals about his parenting ability. They concluded the allegation of 'likelihood of physical harm' was unsubstantiated. The concern about 'neglect' was resolved by a conversation with A.D.M. whereby he agreed not to leave the children alone for any period of time. The file was closed.

[129] It is not in the best interests of children to be dragged into child protection investigations instigated by their parents competing for advantage in a contested custody dispute. However, I accept C.L.M.'s explanation that before calling MCFD, she did contact counsel with her concerns and counsel advised her to call MCFD. Given she was acting on legal advice; I cannot fairly impute nefarious motives to C.L.M. in calling MCFD. However, in terms of assessing her willingness to cooperate in parenting matters, it is concerning she did not make efforts to speak to A.D.M. about her concerns before calling MCFD, particularly given she had never known him to mistreat the children.

- [130] On another occasion, A.D.M. had taken the children to Alberta to visit extended family. The children are supposed to be exchanged on Sundays. On Thursday the airline cancelled their return flight to Prince George and could not re-book them on another flight until Tuesday, thereby cutting a couple of days into C.L.M.'s parenting time. When advised of this unforeseen development, C.L.M. demanded A.D.M. return the children by Sunday, even if that meant he had to leave the family gathering days

early or take inconvenient multi-leg flights. A.D.M. explained he would 'love to get home earlier' and would keep exploring alternative options with the airline, but felt the kids would be disappointed to be forced to return early and miss their planned family events. He offered to provide C.L.M. additional make-up parenting time. There was no pressing reason the children had to be home by Sunday and C.L.M. had no special plans for them.

[131] Rather than be flexible in the face of airline troubles beyond the parties' control, C.L.M. demanded A.D.M. respect her parenting time and return the children, 'regardless of how fun it is.' She accused him of 'attempted manipulation,' and stated 'I expect you to uphold our parenting agreement and make arrangements to have the children back in my care without delay,' and 'I find it wildly inappropriate that you have so little respect for our legal agreement.' She ultimately got legal counsel involved in an effort to force the children's return on the usual exchange date, incurring the legal costs associated with that. A.D.M. capitulated to her demands and returned with the children on a Saturday multi-leg flight that necessitated seven hours of travel time instead of the 1.5 hour direct flight on Tuesday.

[132] I find C.L.M.'s reaction to this situation was unreasonable. To the extent C.L.M. proposes the children live with her and travel back and forth to Prince George for A.D.M.'s parenting time, her inflexibility in the face of unforeseen travel disruptions does not inspire confidence. In a relocation application, the court should consider the reasonableness of the proposal of the person who intends to relocate the child to vary the exercise of parenting time, decision making responsibility or contact, taking into consideration, among other things, the location of the new place of residence and the travel expenses ( Barendregt, para. 154).

[133] By contrast, when C.L.M. took the children to Mexico with M.S., she was late returning with the children. A.D.M. took no issue with the children being exchanged late and did not demand she change her flights to comply with the letter of the Separation Agreement.

[134] C.L.M.'s contends the children should live with her because A.D.M. is uncooperative. She says he his hostile towards her and wants to make her 'suffer' for ending the marriage.

[135] In support of this assertion, C.L.M. adduced a text from A.D.M. where he says he will never respect or accept M.S., and that he was devastated by her infidelity and could not forgive her. However, C.L.M. adduced this text on its own and excluded important preceding text messages. A.D.M. produced the entire conversation history which provided the context for that message. The conversation was initiated by C.L.M. sending messages about pursuing reconciliation. A.D.M. replied he was no longer interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with her and sent the impugned text explaining why he would not reconcile. In the preceding texts, he also says she will always be he children's mother that they had been friendly lately, and he would like that to continue. I accept A.D.M.'s evidence that the tone of his text was emotional because the break-up was still fresh and he understood M.S. was at C.L.M.'s house visiting when she was sending him messages about reconciling. Having the benefit of reviewing the entire text conversation, I do not accept C.L.M.'s contention that A.D.M. seeks to vindictively use parenting arrangements as a means to punish her.

[136] I also accept A.D.M.'s evidence he never told C.L.M. she would have to 'suffer' for ending the marriage. When C.L.M. advised she wanted to move to Victoria and asked him to relocate with the children, A.D.M. complained she wanted everyone else to make sacrifices for her happiness because she was the only one who would benefit from that move. His email to C.L.M. speak of sacrificing, not 'suffering.' Given the proposed move was solely for C.L.M.'s benefit, A.D.M.'s position was justifiable and not an expression of his desire to make C.L.M. 'suffer.'

[137] Other than the cancelled flight incident, there is no evidence either party has over held the children during their parenting time or otherwise denied the other parent's parenting time. I note, however, C.L.M. flies up to Prince George and works remotely on those weeks she has parenting time, so she typically is not present after the children are exchanged on Sunday. Put simply, she is generally not in a position to deny

A.D.M.'s parenting time because she does not live in Prince George. She leaves Prince George to return to work in Victoria at the end of her parenting time. Given those circumstances, my ability to draw inferences about her likely compliance with any future parenting time order where she is the primary parent in Victoria is limited.

[138] C.L.M. suggests A.D.M. is being unreasonable because he will not agree to permit the children to move to Victoria and exercise parenting time as set out in her proposal. I found her position confounding. When one person makes an onerous request of the other, the other is not being unreasonable or uncooperative because they decline to accept. C.L.M. suggests her proposal is eminently fair and does to really detract from A.D.M.'s current exercise of parenting time at all. This is based on a puzzling calculation by which she purports to deduct all of his current exercise of parenting time when the children are not in his immediate presence, such as when they are with their grandparents or sleeping over at a friend's house.

[139] I find it telling that when the same parenting time proposal was put to C.L.M. in reverse, whereby the children would remain in Prince George and she would exercise parenting time on school breaks, C.L.M. was not interested.

[140] C.L.M. took unreasonable positions on a number of matters, such as her criticism of A.D.M.'s parenting ability because he volunteers for search and rescue; her reaction to learning the children were left alone for a few minutes; her response to the flight cancellation incident; her indignation that A.D.M. would not just agree to let her relocate the children; and her position that any time the children are not in A.D.M.'s direct care he is not really exercising parenting time. C.L.M. also levied unfair criticism at A.D.M. for taking E.P.M. to school in the afternoon after having a tooth extraction in the morning and was administered nitrous oxide. C.L.M. dramatically described this as a 'challenging moment for [her] as a mother' because her child was going to school 'under the influence of a controlled substance.' A.D.M. had not taken E.P.M. to school under the influence of nitrous oxide, which had long worn off. Her mouth was just still a bit frozen.

[141] It is C.L.M.'s perception that the children are more attached to her. She feels their relationship with A.D.M. is 'important,' but that the children would be heartbroken if their time with her was reduced. I inferred her evidence to mean they would not be so heartbroken if their time with A.D.M. was reduced. When asked about how relocating the children will be hard on them given the trauma they already experienced from the family break-up, C.L.M. responded it would be harder on the children to be separated from her. Her perception is relevant in assessing her valuation of the children's relationship with their father. By contrast, A.D.M. does not claim the children love him more than their mother.

[142] C.L.M. also frequently made reference to the option that A.D.M. could move to Victoria, or visit Victoria, in order to preserve his relationship with the children. This solution is unrealistic given A.D.M. has no connections, history or job in Victoria. C.L.M. gave the impression that it was her life and her relationship with the children that should be afforded paramountcy.

[143] C.L.M. complains A.D.M. fails to facilitate contact between her and the children during his parenting time. He sometimes blocks her number. A.D.M. admits he has blocked her number a few times when their communications broke down and were getting 'nasty and 'not productive.' This included texts from C.L.M. accusing him of being aggressive, evil and claiming she was fearful of the children's safety while they were in his care. I agree such texts are not productive. In those occasions A.D.M. did not cut off all communications; rather, he requested C.L.M. communicate with him by email. However, he emphasizes this only occurred a few times, and only when the children were with C.L.M. in her care.

[144] A.D.M. denies C.L.M.'s allegation that he prohibits the children from communicating with her during his parenting time. The only time he has prevented the children from calling their mother is when they make requests after bedtime, in which case he facilitates a call in the morning. He tries to prompt the children to call their mother at least three times a week, even when they are busy with their own activities and do not want to.

[145] After considering all of the evidence, the positions taken by the parties and their historical actions since separation, it is my view that A.D.M. will be more diligent and cooperative in facilitating C.L.M.'s parenting time than the converse. If the children are relocated to Victoria and only spend time with A.D.M. during school breaks, there is a risk his parenting time will not always occur due to actions or positions taken by C.L.M. If the children are primarily resident in Prince George and attend school here, it is much more difficult for C.L.M. to justify refusing to return the children for A.D.M.'s parenting time.

[146] The cooperation factor weighs against permitting relocation. If the children remain in Prince George, there is a higher probability parenting time orders will be followed, conflict will be reduced, and the children's relationships with both of their parents will be preserved in their best interests.

## Conclusion

[147] After considering all of the factors set out in s. 37 of the Family Law Act , I find it is in the children's best interests to remain in Prince George. Accordingly, pursuant to s. 69(2) of the Family Law Act , the children are prohibited from being relocated from the city of Prince George, B.C. or its 20 km radius.
