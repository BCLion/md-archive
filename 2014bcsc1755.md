Place and Date of Judgment:

September 18, 2014

## Introduction

- [1] In  2008, the parties separated after living together for almost eight years. They  are parents of two children ages 9 and 11. Before they  were divorced, they settled all family law claims, including  property, parenting and child support issues, by a separation agreement ('Agreement').
- [2] These applications concern proposed changes to the parenting arrangements and the claimant's child support obligations.
- [3] In  2009 the claimant changed his occupation resulting  in a reduction  in his income. He seeks a variation in his past and prospective child support obligations commensurate with his changed circumstances.
- [4] The claimant also wishes to expand his parenting time with the children.  He recently  changed his residence from Vancouver,  BC to Langley, BC, and this relocation impacts the children  and the parties' parenting arrangements.
- [5] The respondent  believes the claimant's change of residence will be detrimental  to the children  without  modification to the parenting schedule.  She seeks enforcement  of the Agreement regarding the claimant's past support obligations and a continuation  of the current  level of support.
- [6] The key issues in this proceeding are the intervening  changes in the claimant's employment  income on the claimant's support obligations and the change in residence on the children's parenting schedule.

## Background

- [7] The parties' two children  are E.M., born September 2003, and P.M., born July 2005.
- [8] When the parties separated, they both resided in North Vancouver.  The claimant was a chartered accountant  with Grant  Thornton  LLP in Vancouver.  And the respondent was a product manager with Best Buy Canada.

- [9] On April 29, 2008 the parties entered into the Agreement resolving the issues of property division, parenting,  child support and spousal support. Under the Agreement the parties continued  as the children's joint custodians, and the children's primary residence was with the respondent.  The Agreement included a very  detailed process for addressing changes in their personal and financial circumstances.  Since 2008, the parties have  made mutually  agreed changes to the parenting schedule  and to the claimant's support obligations.
- [10] The parties are following  parenting regime for the children  set out in the Agreement except for some minor changes agreed April 2008.
- [11] The claimant now cares for the children  as follows:

Weeks 1 and 3: Thursday  3:00 pm to Friday 3:00 pm;

Weeks 2 and 4: Wednesday 2:00 pm to Sunday 5:00 pm.

- [12] These provisions are an expansion  from the dates set out in the Agreement:

Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4: Wednesday from 4:30 pm to 8:00 pm;

Every other week:   Friday 4:30 pm to Sunday  5:00 pm.

- [13] In  2009 the claimant agreed to a Guidelines income of $206,000 and paid support under that Agreement until  2011. Since June 2011 he has paid monthly  child support in the amount  of $153; the parties have not established the appropriate level of support as provided under the Agreement.
- [14] The Agreement includes the following:
7. RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF GUARDIANS

38. FILE AS JUDGMENT

Either party May file a fully executed copy of this Agreement in the New Westminster Registry of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, pursuant to the Family Relations Act (British Columbia).

- [15] The parties also agreed on the division of parenting time over holidays, birthdays,  summer vacations and other important events.  These days are essentially divided equally  between the parties and have not changed.
- [16] Decision making about the children's affairs was generally  to be a joint decision.
- [17] The Agreement was filed for enforcement  in this Court on June 16, 2008.
- [18] At the time of the Agreement the parties agreed that  R.M.'s Guidelines income was $170,000 (R.M. is a chartered accountant  in good standing in BC, England and Wales) and N.M.'s Guidelines income was $100,000. Both parties were expecting to earn higher incomes in the future.
- [19] The claimant's actual income in 2008 was $225,000 and in 2009 he earned $206,000. The Agreement provided for changes in the claimant's child support payments to reflect the Child Support Guidelines for those years.
- [20] In  December 2009, the claimant withdrew  from his accounting  partnership  to pursue new business opportunities. His new business has not generated income at the level he received from his accounting  firm.
- [21] Sometime after separation, the claimant moved to a residence in Yaletown, and in November 2013, he moved to a home in Langley  BC. The claimant would like to achieve equal parenting time with the children and seeks a further  extension  of his parenting time. Due to the claimant's latest change in his residence, the respondent seeks a reduction in his parenting time due to the added commuting  times between North  Vancouver  and Langley.

- [22] The parties obtained a 'Views of the Child Report' from Robert Findlay,  a family therapist and counsellor.  Mr. Findlay said the children  were unanimous  in wanting  more time with their father;  he confirmed they do not object to the extra travelling  time involved  commuting  to their father's new home.

[23] The claimant resides with his fiancé, Zanet Benakova, in his Langley home. Mr. Findlay reported that her parenting  style is a problem for the children  although the claimant does not seem to recognize any issues.

## The Applications

## Respondent

- [24] On October 10, 2012, the respondent  requested the following:
2. (a) that the Agreement be enforced with respect to child support payments and special and extraordinary  expenses;
3. (b) that the claimant's Guidelines income be retroactively  imputed to July 1, 2011;
4. (c) that the claimant pay his proportionate share of special expenses and extraordinary  expenses based on his imputed Guidelines income; and,
5. (d) an order varying  the Agreement and establishing a new schedule of parenting time that would require less travelling  for the children.

## Claimant

- [25] On November 7, 2012, the claimant countered  and requested the following:
2. (a) an order adjusting  the amount  of child support payable from June 1, 2010 to May 1, 2011;
3. (b) an order that the respondent reimburse the claimant for over payment of child support paid between June 1, 2010 and May 1, 2011;

- (c) that the Agreement be varied to remove paragraph 34(1) (a) requiring the parties to share child care expenses;
- (d) that each party proportionately  share special and extraordinary expenses after agreeing to them in writing before incurring  the expense;
- (e) that the respondent provide receipts for special and extraordinary expenses since June 1, 2008;
- (f) that the respondent reimburse the claimant for any over payment  of special and extraordinary  expenses as confirmed in the receipts the respondent  produced;
- (g) that the respondent increase life insurance  coverage from $200,000 to $500,000 and provide proof of such insurance  to the claimant;
- (h) that the Agreement be varied to provide that the parties will share joint primary residence of the children;
- (i) that the parties' parenting time be readjusted to include alternating weeks from Wednesday at 3:00 pm until  Monday  mornings; if Monday is a holiday,  then  the children  will return  at 5:00 pm. In  the other weeks, the respondent  proposes that he will collect the children  from school on Thursday  and return  them to the respondent  at 3:00 pm on Fridays (including  statutory  holidays and professional days);
- (j) that the parties communicate  about the children  by email and text only; and,
- (k) that the respondent be restrained from approaching the claimant  when picking up and dropping off the children.

## The Application Materials

[26] The respondent's initial application was filed in October 2012. The claimant's response to that application was accompanied by his new application dated November 2012. On March 14, 2014 the respondent advanced a new notice of application seeking an order amending the Agreement to provide the claimant with parenting time during two days in weeks one and three from after school to 6:30 pm one night and after school to 7:30 pm the other night.  In  weeks two and four the respondent  proposes that the claimant will collect the children from school two days a week and return  them to the respondent's  home at 6:30 pm one night  and 7:30 pm the other night and care for the children  from Friday after school until  Sunday evening  at 7:30 pm.

- [27] The respondent's applications cite as the legal basis for her claims the Agreement, the Family Relations Act , 1996 R.S.B.C., 1996 c. 128, the Divorce Act , R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2 nd Supp) and the Guidelines .
- [28] The claimant cites the Family Relations Act, the Supreme Court Family Rules and the Family Law Ac t, S.B.C. 2011, c. 25 [ Act ] as the Legal Basis supporting  his positions.
- [29] The application materials filed in this proceeding were woefully  deficient when examined from the perspective of the rules. Neither party  filed a written argument  at the outset although  the respondent  provided a helpful  written summary  in reply.  It is important to consider that the Rules of Court are designed to assist the parties in knowing in advance the legal and factual  issues the will be addressed in argument. The Notice of Application is also important to provide the Court in advance with a fulsome description of the facts and legal argument  on the issues.
- [30] In Dupre v. Patterson , 2012 BCSC 1561 Adair J. addressed this difficult issue. She said:
- [48] I agree with and adopt Master Bouck's comments concerning what a notice of application must contain. The same will apply with respect to an application response (Form 33), and the notice of application and

application response under the Supreme Court Family Rules (Forms F31 and F32).

- [49] In Fraser, Horn and Griffin, The Conduct of Civil Litigation in British Columbia , 2nd ed. loose-leaf (Markham: LexisNexis, 2007) one of the leading texts on practice and procedure, the authors say this concerning the 'Legal Basis' section of a notice of application, at p. 32-3 [notes omitted]:

The notice must set out the rule, enactment or other jurisdictional authority relied on for the orders sought and any other legal arguments on which the order sought should be granted (Rule 8-1(4)(c)). If appropriate, applicable cases may be cited. The argument to be made in chambers should be fully disclosed and should contain more than a cursory listing of the rules that might support the particular application.

- [50] The requirements under the current Rules represent a fundamental change from the practice under the former Rules of Court . Under the former Rules , Rule44(3) and Form 55 (the form of notice of motion) only required a bare statement of the Rule or enactment relied upon. An outline (see Form 125 and former Rule51A(12)), outlining the legal arguments to be made, was then delivered later in the exchange of motion materials and prior to the hearing. That is not the practice under the current Rules .
- [51] If a notice of application does not contain the information now required under the Rules , the party filing it has failed to give proper notice - to the opposing party and to the court - of the nature of the application. However, all too frequently, counsel in both civil and family cases are signing and filing inadequate notices of application and application responses. The notice of application filed in this case was not at all unique. However, such documents do not comply with the Rules .
- [31] Neither party referred to authorities  to be relied on nor did they  address any legal arguments  in their notices of application.
- [32] The legal arguments  on these applications were not revealed until  oral submissions were made. The current  Rules contemplate  that counsel  will apply their minds to the factual and legal issues and present those summaries in a way that assists the Court in preparing to hear applications in complex cases.
- [33] These applications are intended to be summary  trials of the issues between the parties. They  are final orders with significant implications for the parties and their children  and the failure to adhere to the rules is not acceptable.

[34] Neither party directly addressed the tension between the efficacy of the Agreement and other remedies under  the Act . Nonetheless,  I understood  many of the respondent's arguments  were to the effect that the Agreement continues  to govern the relationship and obligations of the parties.

## R.M.'s Reliability and Credibility

- [35] The outcome of these applications is dependent on the reliability of the party's evidence contained in their affidavits. I rejected the respondent's application to adduce a further  affidavit at the November 12, 2013 hearing; it was prepared and served far too late and would have prejudiced the claimant.
- [36] R.M.'s affidavit evidence raises issues about his credibility and reliability. These reasons address the three separate notices of application together and I have considered all of the affidavit material filed in each application as it affects the overall result  in all of the applications. The overriding considerations here are the best interests of the children  which cannot  be assessed without  considering all of the evidence tendered.
- [37] Aspects of R.M.'s evidence have caused me to doubt his credibility and reliability. Statements  made in his affidavits persuade me that  I cannot  rely on his evidence with any  confidence and I am compelled to place less weight on his evidence in regard to the financial and parenting issues in this case.
- [38] He demonstrated a dismissive attitude toward his contractual  obligations under the Agreement and to his statutory  obligations regarding his change of residence. He disregarded the covenants  he made when  settling the terms of the Agreement and precipitating these applications.
- [39] Indeed,  R.M. clearly  decided that paras. 22 - 24 of the Agreement regarding parenting issues and child support terms did not bind him and that  he could simply apply to this Court for an order approving his decisions. R.M. candidly acknowledged that he did not comply with the Agreement regarding his proposed change in

residence without  any explanation  other than the fact that he did not think the respondent  would agree to his move.

[40] R.M. also failed to comply with s. 66 of the Act . He simply changed his residence without  regard to the respondent's right to notice and denying  her a practical opportunity  to address the issue before it was a fait accompli. He simply ignored his responsibility under the Act . in addition to the Agreement.

[41] His attitude on the issue was also somewhat defiant; in his affidavit #6, he explained his views on the relocation issue as 'I  am not sure where [N.M.]  wishes me to move". He said she had not suggested where he should live other than Yaletown.

[42] In  sum, his attitude towards breaching the Agreement appears to be 'so what.'

[43] On the issue of moving to Langley,  R.M. was also not forthright  or honest in his affidavit material.

[44] On October 23, 2013, he swore an affidavit addressing child access issues, and did not disclose that he was imminently  moving to Langley.  In  other words, he swore his affidavit without  revealing his plans to relocate his residence; these plans were obviously  know to him at the time.

[45] I  have a larger concern with R.M.'s financial statement  sworn before Mr. Virk on November 11, 2013.

[46] Notwithstanding  that he had signed the sale documents  for his Yaletown property and had completed the purchase  of the Langley  property six days before, he untruthfully  concealed both the purchase of the Langley house and the sale of the Yaletown  residence. He knew that this change in his residence was a material factor in the parenting regime for the children  but attempted to hide the fact from the Court.

[47] In  para. 2 of that affidavit he said 'I do not anticipate any significant changes in the information set out in this financial  statement.'  But the Langley house sale was

obviously  negotiated well before the November 5, 2013 completion date of the purchase.  He appears to have signed the sale documents  for his Yaletown  property on November 11; given the usual sequence of events  leading to the listing and selling of land, it is inconceivable  to me that he did not know that he was selling the Yaletown  property on November 11.

- [48] This conduct borders on perjury,  and based on these factors, I place very little weight on R.M.'s evidence where it conflicts with the respondent's evidence or involves  assertions regarding his employment  and business prospects.
- [49] R.M.'s attitude towards his support obligations is equally  obdurate.
- [50] I  conclude that  when the parties signed the Agreement, they  believed that the parenting and support terms were in the best interests of the children.  The processes agreed to were intended to permit variations of support and residence if the changes were in the children's best interest.
- [51] But the claimant has not followed the Agreement's terms for varying  or reviewing support or changing his residence.
- [52] R.M. said he told the respondent  that his employment  was changing  and then told her that he would  be reducing child support.
- [53] He did not seek any of the reviews provided for in the  Agreement. He simply just stopped paying the amount  that the Agreement required.
- [54] Similarly, he changed his residence without  following  the Agreement or the provisions of the Act regarding that change.
- [55] His behaviour has been defiant and falls below any  acceptable standard.
- [56] Although  R.M.'s approach to these issues has been reprehensible,  I must address the issues on this application with a view to the  children's best interests.

## The Issues

- [57] This case has eight issues based on the parties' applications:
1. Should I impute a Guidelines income to R.M.?
2. What is the date of review for child support?
3. Should I retroactively  vary  the claimant's support obligations?
4. Should I adjust child support because of shared custody arrangements?
5. Should any  special and extraordinary  expenses be reimbursed?
6. Should I make an order that the respondent must increase the amount of her life insurance?
7. Should parenting time be varied? and
8. Should I appoint a parenting coordinator?

## Applicable Law

## Setting aside or replacing agreements for child support

- [58] The Act deals with agreements affecting children,  and it permits a court to set aside or replace a part of an agreement respecting child support:
2. 148(1) An agreement respecting child support is binding only if the agreement is made
3. (a) after separation, or
4. (b) when the parties are about to separate, for the purpose of being effective on separation.
- (2) A written agreement respecting child support that is filed in the court is enforceable under this Act and the Family Maintenance Enforcement Act as if it were an order of the court.
- (3) On application by a party, the court May set aside or replace with an order made under this Division all or part of an agreement respecting child support if the court would make a different order on

consideration of the matters set out in section 150 [determining child support] .

## Determining child support amounts

- [59] Section 150 of the Act addresses how a court determines child support:
2. 150(1) If a court makes an order respecting child support, the amount of child support must be determined in accordance with the child support guidelines.
- (2) Despite subsection (1), a court May order child support in an amount different from that required by the child support guidelines if
4. (a) the parties consent under section 219 [persons May consent to order being made] or have an agreement respecting child support, and
5. (b) the court is satisfied that reasonable arrangements have been made for the support of the child.
- (3) The court must consider the child support guidelines for the purposes of subsection (2), but must not consider arrangements made for the support of the child to be unreasonable only because the amount required under the child support guidelines differs from those arrangements.
- (4) Despite subsection (1), a court May order child support in an amount different from that required by the child support guidelines if satisfied that
8. (a) an agreement or order respecting the financial duties of the parents or guardians or the division or transfer of property, other than an agreement respecting child support, benefits the child directly or indirectly, or that special provisions have otherwise been made for the benefit of the child, and
9. (b) applying the child support guidelines would be inequitable  on consideration of the agreement, order or special provisions.
- (5) If a court makes an order respecting child support in an amount different from that required under the child support guidelines, it must give reasons for doing so.

## Changes to child support

- [60] Section 152 of the Act deals with changes to child support:

## Changing, suspending or terminating orders respecting child support

- 152(1) On application, a court May change, suspend or terminate an order respecting child support, and May do so prospectively or retroactively.

- (2) Before making an order under subsection (1), the court must be satisfied that at least one of the following exists, and take it into consideration:
2. (a) a change in circumstances, as provided for in the child support guidelines, has occurred since the order respecting child support was made;
3. (b) evidence of a substantial nature that was not available during the previous hearing has become available;
4. (c) evidence of a lack of financial disclosure by a party was discovered after the last order was made.

## Child support in shared custody situations

- [61] Section 9 of the Guidelines addresses child support in shared custody situations:

## Shared custody

9. Where a spouse exercises a right of access to, or has physical custody of, a child for not less than 40 per cent of the time over the course of a year, the amount of the child support order must be determined by taking into account
2. (a) the amounts set out in the applicable tables for each of the spouses;
3. (b) the increased costs of shared custody arrangements; and
4. (c) the conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of each spouse and of any child for whom support is sought.
- [62] In Maultsaid v. Blair , 2009 BCCA 102 [ Maultsaid ] the Court of Appeal outlined the analysis for shared custody situations at paras. 20, 24, and 30:
- [20] With respect I have come to the conclusion the judge in this case erred in principle in holding as she did that the school time was neutral in the calculation of the time the parents have access. I take it as axiomatic that where an access order spells out the time at which the access starts and ends, and there is no agreement that could be said to alter the terms of the order, the access parent does not have, in the language of s. 9 'a right to access' beyond that time. That is, it cannot be counted to the benefit of the access parent seeking to reach the 40 per cent level so as to move into the area of the court's discretion to relieve against payment of all or a portion of the Guidelines amount.

…

- [24] It is not clear in s. 9 how one is to calculate time. In some cases it may be appropriate to consider days because that is the tenor of the

…

- [30] I recognize this calculation brings the matter close to 40 per cent and appears arbitrary. However, in my view, it is not open to the court, faced with the express wording of s. 9, a court order particularizing 'the right to access', and a measure of the time that falls short of the requisite 40 per cent, to ignore the words, the mandatory requirement, chosen by Parliament. In the words of the Alberta Court in L.C. v. R.O.C., 2007 ABCA 158 (CanLII), 2007 ABCA 158, 'there is no place for 'deeming' parenting time to be what it is not'.
- [63] Saunders J.A. wrote the judgments  in both Maultsaid and Berry v. Hart , 2003 BCCA 659 [ Berry ],  and Berry also dealt with the difficult analysis of joint custody regimes and the 40% rule in s. 9 of the Guidelines .
- [64] In Berry , Saunders J.A. also noted that determining whether  s. 9 of the Guidelines applies is a 'matter of judgement'  and not simply a 'time accounting exercise.' Rather:
- [9] One must also ask, considering that this approach may satisfy only the law of unintended consequences, whether the minutiae of such record keeping really determines whether s. 9 of the Guidelines applies. Rarely can anything be measured with precision. Even science recognizes that all measurements are subject to a margin of error.
- [10] In my view the issue is a matter of judgment not amenable to simply a time accounting exercise. I consider that in determining whether the threshold level for application of s. 9 is met the question is whether the paying parent spends such a sizeable percentage of time with a child or children that, on any reasonable view of the evidence and considering the advantage that may accrue to a child in spending the occasional additional day, part day or hour with a parent, one can say reasonably that the 40 percent or more level is achieved. It follows, in my view, that a court may assess child-parent time as meeting the s. 9 criteria without a tight accounting. That assessment should be made by considering the broader context of the parenting arrangement. It perhaps bears mentioning, further, that simply finding that a parental regime comes within s. 9 does not compel an automatic reduction in child support. That determination must be made considering all of the criteria in ss. (a) to (c) of s. 9.
- [65] Finally,  in Franke v. Franke , 2008 BCSC 1145 Joyce J. helpfully  and thoroughly  summarized  applicable jurisprudence  on this issue at paras. 28-30:

order or agreement setting out the right of access. In others, a calculation of hours may be appropriate.

- [28] With respect, I do not agree with the defendant that the judgments of Koenigsberg and Neilson JJ. in S.L.P. v. C.W.P. stand for the proposition that the court can embark on an analysis of the factors set out in s. 9(a) to (c) even where the 40 percent threshold required by s. 9 is not met. In my view, Koenigsberg and Neilson JJ.'s reasons for judgment are examples of the application of the principle enunciated in Berry v. Hart , namely that in making the determination whether the threshold is met, the court need not microscopically examine the contested evidence with respect to every hour that the parties say they spend with the child to determine whether a close case falls on one side of the line or the other. They deal with the methodology for determining whether the threshold was met and do not, in my opinion, stand as authority that the section can be applied where the circumstances fall short of meeting the threshold. As Saunders J.A. stated in Berry v. Hart (para. 10), the essential question is:

…whether the paying parent spends such a sizeable percentage of time with a child or children that, on any reasonable view of the evidence and considering the advantage that may accrue to a child in spending the occasional additional day, part day or hour with a parent, one can say reasonably that the 40 percent or more level is achieved.

- [29] If the 40 percent threshold has been met, the appropriate amount of support must be determined in accordance with s. 9 of the Guidelines : Contino at para. 24. That does not necessarily mean that the resulting support order will be different from the order that would result if s. 3 applied but it does mean that the court must consider the factors set out in s. 9(a) to (c) in determining the appropriate amount of support: Contino at para. 30.
- [30] In Contino, Bastarache J., writing for the majority, expressed the following views with respect to the proper application of s. 9 of the Guidelines :

There is no presumption in favour of awarding the amount that would be payable under s. 3 of the Guidelines and no presumption in favour of reducing the amount downward from the Guidelines (para. 31).

The court should not use a formulaic approach to the application of s. 9 of the Guidelines . The specific language of the section warrants emphasis on flexibility and fairness. The weight of each factor will vary according to the particular facts of each case (para. 39).

Section 9(a) requires the court to consider the amounts set out in the applicable tables for each of the spouses. A simple setoff approach is a useful starting point, especially in cases where there is limited information and the incomes of the parties are not widely divergent but caution should be exercised against a rigid application of the set-off. The set-off amount must be followed by an examination of the continuing

ability  of the recipient parent to meet the needs of the child and full consideration must be given to the last two factors (paras. 41, 44, and 49).

Section 9( b ) does not refer merely to the expenses assumed by the payor parent as a result of the increase in access time from less than 40 percent to more than 40 percent. Section 9( b ) recognizes that the total cost of raising children in shared custody situations may be greater than in situations where there is sole custody. This does not mean that the payor parent is in effect spending more money on the child than he or she was before shared custody was accomplished. It means that the court will generally have to examine the budgets and actual expenditures of both parents in addressing the needs of the children and to determine whether shared custody has in effect resulted in increased costs globally. The actual child care expenses are to be apportioned between the parents in accordance with their respective incomes (paras. 52-53).

Not every dollar spent by a parent in exercising access over the 40 percent threshold results in a dollar saved by the recipient parent. It is possible to presume, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the recipient parent's fixed costs have remained unchanged and that his or her variable costs have been reduced only modestly by the increased access. When no evidence is adduced, the court should recognize the status quo regarding the recipient parent (para. 54).

In analyzing s. 9(c), the court should keep in mind the objectives of the Guidelines , which require a fair standard of support for the child and fair contributions from both parents. What is of particular concern under s. 9( c ) is the standard of living  of the child in each household and the ability of each parent to absorb the costs required to maintain the appropriate standard of living in each circumstance (para. 68).

Some factors to consider under s.9( c ) are the actual spending patterns of the parents; the ability of each parent to bear the increased costs of shared custody (includes consideration of assets, liabilities, income levels, and income disparities); and, standard of living for the child in each household. (para. 69).

[66] Given the broad discretion of the Court conferred by s. 9( c ), a claim by a parent for special or extraordinary  expenses falling within s. 7 of the Guidelines can be examined directly in s. 9 with consideration of all the other factors.

## Special or extraordinary expenses

[67] Section 7 of the Guidelines deals with special or extraordinary  expenses:

## Special or extraordinary expenses

- 7.(1) In a child support order the court May, on either spouse's request, provide for an amount to cover all or any portion of the following expenses, which expenses May be estimated, taking into account the necessity of the expense in relation to the child's best interests and the reasonableness of the expense in relation to the means of the spouses and those of the child and to the family's spending pattern prior to the separation:
- (a) child care expenses incurred as a result of the custodial parent's employment, illness, disability or education or training for employment;
- (b) that portion of the medical and dental insurance premiums attributable to the child;
- (c) health-related expenses that exceed insurance reimbursement by at least $100 annually, including orthodontic treatment, professional counselling provided by a psychologist, social worker, psychiatrist or any other person, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and prescription drugs, hearing aids, glasses and contact lenses;
- (d) extraordinary expenses for primary or secondary school education or for any other educational programs that meet the child's particular needs;
- (e) expenses for post-secondary education; and
- (f) extraordinary expenses for extracurricular activities.

##  Definition of 'extraordinary expenses'

- (1.1) For the purposes of paragraphs (1)( d ) and ( f ), the term 'extraordinary expenses' means
- (a) expenses that exceed those that the spouse requesting an amount for the extraordinary expenses can reasonably cover, taking into account that spouse's income and the amount that the spouse would receive under the applicable table or, where the court has determined that the table amount is inappropriate, the amount that the court has otherwise determined is appropriate; or
- (b) where paragraph ( a ) is not applicable, expenses that the court considers are extraordinary taking into account
- (i) the amount of the expense in relation to the income of the spouse requesting the amount, including the amount that the spouse would receive under the applicable table or, where the court has determined that the table amount is inappropriate, the amount that the court has otherwise determined is appropriate,
- (ii) the nature and number of the educational programs and extracurricular activities,

- (iii) any special needs and talents of the child or children,
- (iv) the overall cost of the programs and activities, and
- (v) any other similar factor that the court considers relevant.

## Sharing of expense

- (2) The guiding principle in determining the amount of an expense referred to in subsection (1) is that the expense is shared by the spouses in proportion to their respective incomes after deducting from the expense, the contribution, if any, from the child.

## Subsidies, tax deductions, etc.

- (3) Subject to subsection (4), in determining the amount of an expense referred to in subsection (1), the court must take into account any subsidies, benefits or income tax deductions or credits relating to the expense, and any eligibility to claim a subsidy, benefit or income tax deduction or credit relating to the expense.

## Underemployment and imputing income

- [68] Section 19 of the Guidelines addresses underemployment  and the imputation of income to a payor spouse:
19. (1)  The court May impute such amount of income to a spouse as it considers appropriate in the circumstances, which circumstances include the following:
3. ( a ) the spouse is intentionally under-employed or unemployed, other than where the under-employment or unemployment is required by the needs of a child of the marriage or any child under the age of majority or by the reasonable educational or health needs of the spouse;
4. ( d ) it appears that income has been diverted which would affect the level of child support to be determined under these Guidelines;
5. ( e ) the spouse's property is not reasonably utilized to generate income;
6. ( f ) the spouse has failed to provide income information when under a legal obligation to do so;
- [69] Donovan v. Donavan , 2000 MBCA 80 [ Donovan ] summarized the important considerations in income imputation issues at para. 21:

The following guidelines May be considered when determining whether to impute income. (See Dr. Julien D. Payne, Imputing Income, 'Determination of Income, Disclosure of Income,' Child Support in Canada, Danrab Inc., August 3, 1999.)

1. There is a duty to seek employment in a case where a parent is healthy and there is no reason why the parent cannot work. It is 'no answer for a person liable to support a child to say he is unemployed and does not intend to seek work or that his potential to earn income is an irrelevant factor' ( Van Gool v. Van Gool 1998 CanLII 5650 (BC CA), (1998), 166 D.L.R. (4 th ) 528 (B.C.C.A.)).
2. When imputing income on the basis of intentional underemployment, a court must consider what is reasonable under the circumstances. The age, education, experience, skills and health of the parent are factors to be considered in addition to such matters as availability of work, freedom to relocate and other obligations.
3. A parent's limited work experience and job skills do not justify a failure to pursue employment that does not require significant skills, or employment in which the necessary skills can be learned on the job. While this May mean that job availability  will be at the lower end of the wage scale, courts have never sanctioned the refusal of a parent to take reasonable steps to support his or her children simply because the parent cannot obtain interesting or highly paid employment.
4. Persistence in unremunerative employment May entitle the court to impute income.
5. A parent cannot be excused from his or her child support obligations in furtherance of unrealistic or unproductive career aspirations.
6. As a general rule, a parent cannot avoid child support obligations by a self-induced reduction of income.

[70] In Donovan , the payor retired from a $60,000 per year position as a policeman in the hopes that he could become a screenwriter  and playwright.  He believed that his situation was of 'short-term  pain for long-term  gain", and he thought his income would still increase substantially  in his new endeavor.  The Court accepted that  a payor parent becomes intentionally  underemployed  if that parent chooses to earn less than  he or she is capable of earning.

[71] The respondent  also relied on Watts v. Willie ,  2004 BCCA 600; Kowbel v. Kowbel ,  2012 MBQB 250; Koch v. Koch , 2012 BCCA 378. I have  considered those cases, and each of them adopts the reasoning in Donovan .

## Discussion

## 1. Should I impute a Guidelines income to R.M.?

[72] For the reasons that follow,  I will impute Guidelines income of $200,000 annually  to the claimant for support purposes.

- [73] Under the provisions of the Agreement, variations in the claimant's support obligations were to be reviewed to ensure  that his payments  met the requirements of the Guidelines .  I n  the  absence of a review by June 1 of any year,  the child support extant  at that time was deemed to satisfy the requirements  of the Guidelines .  Any adjustments  to child support would not apply retroactively.
- [74] The parties have agreed that the Guidelines will be used to consider ongoing support obligations including the provisions of s. 9.
- [75] The respondent  contends that the claimant left his secure partnership  at Grant Thornton  in 2009 to pursue a risky business venture,  and this choice absent the covenants  in the Agreement, could result in a dramatic reduction  in his income and a global reduction in his Guidelines support obligation. The respondent  also argues that  the claimant's income for Guidelines purposes should  be $206,000 and this imputation  should be effective from January  2010 forward. She argues that the claimant did not reasonably abandon his partnership  and the income he would otherwise have earned at or about that  level should  be imputed to him.

[76] In  this case, the claimant bears the onus of adducing evidence to show that his career change and the resulting  income loss were reasonable. He had the means of knowing the state of affairs at Grant Thornton  in 2009 presumably  he knew what prospects existed for employment  with other accounting  firms or in other businesses.

[77] The claimant denies that he deliberately abandoned his partnership interest at the accounting  firm thereby  putting his family's economic security  at risk. He left the firm because he perceived that the firm was doing poorly and that he would ultimately  experience a reduction in income or loss of his position. He submits that

his new business ventures  were pursued  in good faith and with the expectation that they  would generate income equal to or better than  his accounting  practice income.

[78] However, he did not provide any admissible evidence relating to the employment  opportunities open to him at or after 2009 and provided no admissible evidence from management as to the likelihood he might have retained his partnership  interest at Grant  Thornton.  The claimant acknowledges that his new businesses have not been as profitable within his expectations.

[79] He deposes that his new business venture  involves  an investment  of $700,000. If he had not chosen to embark on a speculative  venture,  those funds might have also been available to generate income that would have otherwise benefited his children.

[80] Currently,  he is a director and minority  shareholder  in Cycle Component Network ('CCN') and 2Mevents Inc.  '(2M'). And he also operates a sole proprietorship under  the name '[M.] Business Consulting  Services" (M. Consulting) that provides services to CCN, 2M, and other companies.

[81] He did not describe the measure of his shareholdings  in those corporations; he may hold 49% or 10% of the shares.

[82] CCN and 2M provide online registration membership and fundraising  services to charities and licensing bodies. He invested significantly  in CCN including borrowing against his lines of credit with banks and liquidating his RRSPs. CCN is expanding its sales to the US, but it failed to do business in the United Kingdom. 2M also carried on business in England and Wales.

[83] In  his third affidavit (October 23, 2013), he gave a general commentary  on the financial difficulties extant  at Grant Thornton  LLP in 2009. He said he had the partnership  financial statements indicating that the firm was overstaffed  and carried excess overhead.  He did not produce any of those records on this application. He feared that after 2009 there would  be 'retrenchment'  in the firm impacting all levels

of the business.  After leaving, he said his fears were vindicated, and he described several things that had happened with the firm after his departure.

- [84] Counsel confirmed that the information concerning  Grant  Thornton's  business performance since his departure came to him from other persons; he did not have personal knowledge of the facts set out in his affidavit, and he failed to state the source of this information and belief.
- [85] While I have  already addressed R.M.'s credibility, this second flaw in his evidence bolsters my conclusions  about his lack of credibility and defiant attitude. His failure to disclose that his conclusions  were based on information  and belief and failing to identify the source of the information  render the evidence unreliable and non-compliant  with the Supreme Court Family Rules. I  observe that this application is for a final order and the October 23, 2013 affidavit does not comply with  Rule 10-4 (13) and leave was not requested under Rule  10-4(13)(b)(ii).
- [86] In  his second affidavit, the claimant said that  he believes that his new business will be a great success and provide a much higher longer term earning potential than  he had at Grant Thornton.  He acknowledged that it has taken longer than  anticipated to realize the rewards, but the companies are beginning to show potential. He said he has no opportunity  to rejoin Grant Thornton  as that company has been shrinking  its operation areas; there is no evidence to support that conclusion.
- [87] For the purposes of this application, I accept that the claimant may have had some general concerns  regarding Grant Thornton's  viability.  But I have considered his evidence with great caution due to his lack of credibility.
- [88] I  do not accept that  his affidavit includes admissible evidence confirming that his partnership interest in the firm was at risk in 2009 or that his income with the partnership  was at risk. The evidence does not establish,  on the balance of probabilities, that he would have been ousted from the partnership if he had not  left

or that his income would not have remained at its 2009 level.  On this point, the evidence is simply insufficient  and inadmissible.

[89] In  cross-examination,  the claimant testified about the financial circumstances of CCN and 2M. He performs accounting  services for these two companies and receives an income of $2,000 per month  from each of them. His total income is $48,000 per year.

[90] The claimant owns less than 50% of the shares of both companies and is a director of both companies.

[91] His testimony  regarding his earnings and ventures  included the following.  In essence R.M. asserted that his company  lost a sizable amount of money  in the years after its inception but was moving toward profitability.

[92] In  2011, he owned a company described as 2M Limited (UK), and CCN loaned $82,159 to 2M Limited (UK), and then  in 2012, that amount  increased to $85,384. The claimant said that this loan was written off as uncollectible.

[93] The CCN statements also reveal an inter-company  loan from CCN to 2M Inc. (the Canadian Company).  Oddly, in the 2M financial statements  that loan is disclosed as $100,441, a discrepancy of $2,500.

[94] 2M Limited (UK) also owed $527 to 2M Inc.

[95] The financial statements  disclose that 2M is indebted to the claimant for $77,814 and $1,270 to a Phil Mohat,  presumably  the claimant's partner.

[96] CCN was indebted to the claimant for $661,468 as of September 30, 2012. That amount  increased from $588,086.

[97] Mr. Mohat appears to have shareholder's loans of $13,446 in 2011 and $9,108 in 2012. R.M. did not identify the majority  shareholder  in any of his businesses. There was no indication that  the majority  shareholders  in either companies had invested at the level of R.M.'s commitment.  It appears to me that the

only  person to commit significant personal funds to these businesses was the claimant notwithstanding  that he was a minority  shareholder.  I do not understand why  R.M.,  as a minority  shareholder  in these two companies has committed approximately  $661,468 in shareholder  loans, whereas the only  other investor (presumably  the other shareholder)  appears to have investments  of approximately $10,000.

[98] The claimant's evidence concerning  his current  business arrangements  and investments,  his occupation,  and his prospects is of limited value  in light of the general uncertainty  for his businesses in their early stages.

[99] He said he invested significantly  in CCN and 2M with the expectation that they  would 'seek to be profitable in the foreseeable future.'  His aim was 'to provide a secure future  for myself  and the children.'

[100] He said that his income was expected to be $48,000 per year from his private consulting  business. And he also expects to continue  receiving a $7,200 pension income from Grant Thornton.  So in total, his income is only  $55,200. His 2013 financial statement  suggests his Line 150 income for 2013 would  be $57,149.

[101] CCN financial statements  prepared by the claimant reveal that the company lost $180,579 in 2011 and $91,539 in 2012. In  those two years the company  payroll was $196,530 (2011) and $165,551 (2012)

- [102] In  November 2013, R.M.'s personal lines of credit were up to $958,000.

Apparently,  these three lines of credit were used to fund his business ventures  and possibly the purchase of his Langley  residence.

[103] I  have observed that  in fiscal 2013, 2M was also indebted to shareholders  for $57,125 and to CCN $107,229. The amount shareholder loans were not attributed  to specific shareholder.

[104] R.M.'s Line 150 income for 2009 was $206,395 and $99,688 for 2012.

[105] Under the Agreement, the claimant paid child support to the respondent  in 2008 based on a Guidelines income of $224,939 and in 2009 on income of $206,395. I presume these adjustments  to his support obligations were made as a result  of reviews contemplated  by the Agreement.

[106] The claimant continued  to pay child support of $3,352 per month  throughout 2010 until  June 2011, including special and extraordinary  expenses.

[107] Commencing in July 2011, the claimant reduced this amount  to $82 per month for support and $71 for special and extraordinary  expenses because his income from his new businesses had dropped substantially,  and he believed $153 per month  was the appropriate payment under  the Guidelines .

[108] The respondent  contends that I should  impute income at his 2009 level because the claimant unilaterally  quit his employment  and has not established a sufficient  reason for doing so. This argument  and engages a consideration of s. 19(a)(e) of the Guidelines .

[109] Moreover,  the respondent  submits that  the claimant has not provided evidence of other accounting  positions that might have  been available in the job market when he left Grant  Thornton.

[110]  The claimant acknowledges that the new companies have been slower in achieving prosperity than he had anticipated, but he believes that strong growth  is in the 2014 forecast. The claimant argued that he is a minority shareholder  in the two companies that are the core of his new business venture.  He did not explain how future  profits might be distributed between the shareholders  and he did not provide any persuasive evidence that his decision to leave the accounting  partnership  was reasonable.

[111] The claimant said he invested $665,000 of his own money in this business. The financial statements  reflect that CCN is obliged to pay discretionary  interest at the rate '3% plus prime, cumulative.'  This could produce additional income of at least $26,600 per year.

- [112] The claimant contended that his reasons for leaving the accounting partnership  were both negative and positive. He feared a long period of retrenchment  as the firm downsized, and he was concerned that salaries would not go up and partners would not be admitted. He argued that his decision was designed to protect his economic future.
- [113] The claimant acknowledges that he did not apply for work at other accounting firms nor did he investigate other opportunities in the accounting  field when  he left Grant Thornton.
- [114] The claimant accepts that an amount  should  be imputed to him for the purposes of establishing his Guidelines obligation for child support. He argues that the issue to be decided on this point is only  the appropriate amount  of income to be imputed to him.
- [115] The claimant argued that Donovan did not apply in this case; indeed, R.M. paid support at the higher level notwithstanding  he had no income during the early stages of leaving  Grant Thornton.
- [116] He said that his assertion that his new companies' business is improving is sufficient  to discharge the onus of proof that his decision was reasonable.
- [117] Although  his application contains a claim for support from the respondent, R.M. conceded in argument  that he is not seeking any support from her.
- [118] Considering the evidence about his partnership interest and his obvious accounting  skills, I am not satisfied that R.M. discharged the burden of proving that a person of his age, skills, education and business acumen could not have maintained an income over $200,000 per year since 2009. As mentioned, there is no evidence that the claimant considered alternative  work; rather he decided to pursue  the new business ventures  to the exclusion  of any other professional or employment prospects. He has not satisfied me that he could not have remained in the  Grant Thornton  partnership and continued  to earn income in the order of $206,000 per

year, or alternate employment,  with remuneration  commensurate  with his 2009 income.

- [119] Therefore,  I find that  his decision to leave the accounting  firm and the income earned while he remained there was not reasonable.
- [120] The claimant suggested that  I should  impute income around $130,000. The respondent  argued that the imputation should  be between $170,000 and $206,000. In  her concluding  argument,  she said that $206,000 based on his 2009 income was the appropriate amount  to impute.
- [121] I  recognize that income from a professional practice may vary over time.
- [122] Other than  his Line 150 income of $224,939 in 2008 and $206,395 in 2009 I have no reliable evidence about the amount  he would  have earned if he had remained with his partnership  or in some other accounting  position. The  best evidence available is his 2009 income.
- [123] Accordingly,  I have determined that a fair imputation  of R.M.'s ability to earn income is $200,000 per year for the purposes of establishing his Guidelines income from June  2013 and into the future.  R.M.'s support obligation after June 2013 will be settled based on an imputation of income at $200,000 per annum.
- [124] His prior year's support obligations remain as defined in the Agreement.

## 2. What is the date of review for child support?

- [125] I  have concluded that  the date of review for child support is the date prescribed by the Agreement, and I confirm that  date is June 1, 2013.
- [126] The parties applied their minds to the issues of support,  including reviews and variation of the claimant's  obligations. They  agreed to review and, if necessary,  to revise the amount  payable to accord with the Guidelines by June 1 of each year. The Agreement contemplates that  if no review is conducted,  the parties are satisfied that the ongoing support meets the Guidelines requirements.

[127] Most importantly,  changes to child support would  not apply retroactively  from the date of any review.  In fact, the parties were quite clear that adjustments  to child support would not apply retroactively  from the date of any review.

- [128] The Agreement also provides that either party may request a review of child support based on a material change in circumstances  by delivering a written  notice. The Agreement specified that  mediation would  be used to resolve any disagreement regarding support following  a material change in circumstances.
- [129] The evidence establishes that child support was not reviewed after June 1, 2010 and the parties had agreed that there would be no retroactive adjustments  to child support.

[130] Although  the claimant said that he informed the respondent  that he was leaving his partnership  at Grant  Thornton  in 2009 and his income may be reduced, he did not, at any time, initiate a review of his support obligations under para. 36 of the Agreement. Further,  he did not give notice to the respondent claiming a material change in circumstances  warranting  a reduction or change in child support nor did he initiate mediation prior to his Notice of Application filed November 7, 2012.

- [131] This hearing began on May 21, 2013.
- [132] Curiously,  the Agreement does not provide a mechanism  for varying  support if the parties failed to reach agreement under para. 37. Under para. 36, the parties may apply for specific enforcement  of the Agreement to achieve a child support amount that properly corresponds with the Guidelines .
- [133] The hearing on this aspect of the application was concluded  December 11, 2013.
- [134] I  conclude that  for the purposes of this Agreement the date of the review should  be June 1, 2013 which is the day closest to the request for a review constituted  by the claimant's application. Thus,  I confirm that June  1, 2013 is the review date prescribed by the Agreement.

- [135] The claimant's motion does not specify whether  he seeks a change to child support as part of a review that could be held after June  1 of each year or if he seeks a change to a material change in circumstances.
- [136] I  will  consider the claimant's application as a review of his child support obligations under the Agreement and that the change is effective commencing June 1, 2013.
3. Should I retroactively vary the claimant's support obligations? [137] I  will  not retroactively  vary  the claimant's support obligations for the reasons that follow.
- [138] The claimant seeks a retroactive variation in his support obligations from June 1, 2010 to May 1, 2011 and to be reimbursed for any difference between the new amount and the amounts he has paid.
- [139] I  understood that  the parties were agreed that I should  address these questions under the Family Law Act and not the Family Relations Act .
- [140] The negotiated agreement is an extensive  settlement  of all issues concerning the children including  support. In  sum:
1.  Para. 36: captioned 'varying  child support' and it sets out a detailed process to deal with ongoing child support. The Agreement contemplates that reviews of child support will occur annually  from June 1, 2009 onward.
2.  Para. 36(2):  if no review occurs the parties are deemed to consider that the existing support satisfies the Guidelines' requirements.
3.  Para. 36(3): addresses the question of adjustments  to child support which 'will not apply retroactively,  but will be in effect from the date of review'.
4.  Para. 37(2): precludes any retroactive adjustment  to child support. Changes to the claimant's obligation are to be in effect from the date of review.

5.  Para. 37: a review is triggered by a written request by one party specifying a material change in circumstances of the children or the parties, including 'a change in the economic income of one or both parties'.

[141] Under para. 36, no annual  reviews of child support were scheduled,  and the claimant made no written requests for a review under  para. 37 until  this application was commenced.

- [142] The claimant said that he informed the respondent that he was changing employment  in 2009 and his income would likely decrease.
- [143] On November 6, 2009 the claimant addressed an email: 'Dear friends and colleagues' in which  he said his involvement  with Grant  Thornton  was ending, and he said he was embarking on new business ventures.  Around that  time he said he spoke to the respondent and 'sought  to warn the respondent that  his income would drop in the foreseeable future'.  He requested that she accept reduced child support, but she refused.
- [144] The claimant does not resile from the Agreement; he relies on other parts of the Agreement that  restrict the respondent's entitlement  to contributions  for special and extraordinary  expenses unless  the proper procedure was followed.
- [145] His request for retroactive variation of support must be governed under s. 148(3) of the Act .
- [146] Nothing  in s. 148 or s. 150 authorizes  the Court to prospectively  or retroactively  change a child support order. Section 152 allows the Court to make changes to orders retroactively  but not to agreements about child support.  The same option is not available in s. 148 dealing with agreements about child support.

[147] I  am satisfied that the parties were in the best position to assess their abilities to meet the needs of the children  when they  made the Agreement. They  put their minds to optimum mechanisms to address changes in their circumstances and the

Court should not interfere with their agreement unless the  children's interests would be compromise without  the changes requested by the claimant.

[148] The Agreement dealt with changes to those amounts,  and, to the extent  that neither party sought  to review the support terms on an annual  basis on a material change in circumstances  (save and except this application) there is no evidence to suggest that the children's needs will not be met if the Agreement remains unchanged  and enforceable.

[149] The Agreement is an agreement under s. 148 of the Act . It  was made after separation and can be replaced if the Court determines that it would make a different order on consideration of the matters as set out in s. 150.

[150] I  find that the order can be made under s. 148 on a prospective basis only; the Court does not have the power to retroactively  replace part of the Agreement with respect to child support. In  my view, where the parties have addressed issues in a separation agreement that were clearly  designed to provide mechanisms for dealing with changes in circumstances,  they  intended to adopt these mechanisms to eliminate the need to recalculate  and change their obligations in a more adversarial process. Agreements between parties on support issues should  be given considerable weight. see D.B.S. v. S.R.G.; L.J.W. v. T.A.R.; Henry v. Henry; Hiemstra v. Hiemstra , 2006 SCC 37 para. 76-79.

[151] In  any event,  I am satisfied that the Agreement also takes into account  the factors described in s. 150 of the Act . The Agreement contemplates that child support will be payable based on the Guidelines as does s. 150(1).

[152] I  have made a finding imputing income to the respondent.  In  my view, the claimant's obligations under the Agreement conformed to his obligations under the Act and the Guidelines .

[153] The parties did not address the question of reducing or cancelling  arrears of maintenance under s. 174 of the Act , and I  make no comment on whether  this section would apply to the circumstances of this case. In  view of my conclusion

imputing income to the claimant as of June 2013, it is unlikely  that he would be entitled to relief under s. 174; however  I am not deciding that issue at this time.

[154] In  sum, I conclude that:

1. Under the terms of the Agreement, the claimant was obliged to make child support payments  at the amount payable immediately before June 1, 2010 until  the review of his obligation. As a result,  the claimant's obligations for child support do not change from June 1, 2010 to May 1, 2011 and the claimant has not overpaid his support for the children;
2. Under s. 148 of the Act , the parties' Agreement is binding in so far as it was made after separation. The support provisions of the Agreement will not be replaced because I would  not make a different  order after considering the matters set out in s. 150 of the Act ; and,
3. Although  the Court may change an order respecting child support prospectively  or retroactively,  this power does not extend  to making changes to agreements notwithstanding  that  an agreement may  be enforceable as if it was a court order.

[155] Support payable until  June 1, 2013 is, under  the Agreement,  unchanged  from the amounts  payable before June 2011. There will be no retroactive adjustment  to child support;  any change to the claimant's child support,  at least on the basis of income that might have been imputed from 2010 forward would be minimal as I would have imputed income at $200,000 from January  2010 until  June 1, 2013.

- [156] I  will  further  address his prospective child support in the next section.

## 4. Should I adjust child support because of shared custody arrangements?

[157] For the reasons that follow,  I order that the respondent  pay $2,000 child support per month  after June 1, 2013 in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.

[158] The claimant argued that  his support obligations for the children  should be adjusted to take into account that his right to access or physical custody  of the children  exceeds 40% of the time over the course of a year, and that  the amount should  be after considering the respondent's income. The claimant says that  the 40% parenting  time can be measured either in total hours he parents the children or the total number  of days the children are with him; in either case his time exceeds 40% of the total.

[159] The respondent  argues that,  at the time of the Agreement, the claimant's parenting time was less than 40%, so s. 9 of the Guidelines should  apply to mandate that the claimant continue  making ongoing support payments.  The  respondent contends that  to strip her of full  child support because the claimant's time has crept up to 40% would be unfair  and irrational. She contends that the terms of the Agreement adequately deal with questions of quantum  and variation of child support payments.  She argues that the respondent  ignored the contractual  terms regarding support and should  not be relieved of his obligations. She argued that  if I conclude that the claimant now has 40% of the parenting time, her support should be reduced by a nominal amount  of $100 per month.

[160] In  this analysis,  the Court is required to take into account  the increased cost of shared custody  arrangements  and the conditions, means, needs and other circumstances  of each spouse and the two children.

[161] I  have preferred to calculate  the time based on the number  of days the children  will sleep at each parent's house with a further  adjustment  for time they  are in the father's care on alternating  Wednesdays. But I am mindful  of the Court's comments in Berry , and the various other cases that  mentioned earlier.

[162] The order I intend to make is based on the fact that  the children  will be in the claimant's care from Wednesday after school until  7:00 pm and from Thursday 3:00pm until  Monday morning during one sequence and from Thursday  afternoon  to Friday afternoon  during the other week. I have counted 16 school weeks in the fall term, and 25 weeks after Christmas to the end of the school year. There are seven statutory/school  holidays and spring break during these weeks. The length  of spring breaks for the children  may be subject to change. For the purposes of this calculation  I will assume a two week break.

[163] After taking into account breaks and statutory  holiday (which  are shared equally)  during the weeks when  the children  are at school, the children  will reside at the claimant's house for 97.5 nights and the respondent's home for 175.5 nights. On the balance of 92 nights the children's care will be divided equally  between the parties.

- [164] I  recognize that the claimant will care for the children on alternating Wednesdays and I will allot him a further  credit for the purposes of addressing his support obligations and allocate the equivalent  of 10 days care; in sum, a fair allocation of parenting time and responsibility divided by days, results  in the respondent  caring for the children  for 42 % of the year.  This analysis cannot  be approached on strictly  a mathematical  basis due to variables in the calendar and my conclusions  are an informed estimate of the parties' respective roles. In  reaching this conclusion  I am mindful  of the decision in Maultsaid at para 18 and 25 where the Court confirmed its view that the issue is a matter of judgment  and not a simple time accounting  exercise.

[165] The claimant will have physical custody  of the children  for not less than 40% of the time during the year which  leads to a consideration of ss. 9(b) and (c) of the Guidelines. Therefore,  the Court is required to consider the increased cost of shared custody  arrangements  and the circumstances of the parents and children.

[166] In  this case, the claimant's November 2013 financial statement  reveals that his monthly  expenses fell from $6,138 in October 2012 to $3,543 in November 2013.

These expense levels were confirmed by the claimant at a time when  he had already purchased his Langley  home.

- [167] The respondent's expenses from October 2012 were $13,474.42. She did not file a 2013 financial statement.
- [168] The respondent  argued that no evidence supports the suggestion the claimant's costs increased because of his increased time with the children.
- [169] Although  the claimant described aspects of expenses that have changed in light of his new circumstances,  he did not particularize  those increased expenses from having  the children in his care for any additional time. He said his costs of food, outings,  sporting equipment and associated costs have increased. He did not give any estimate of the amount  of the increase.
- [170] I  find that the claimant's increased transportation  costs have substantially increased by reason of the additional time he cares for the children  in his new residence, and those expenses would appear to have  been within the claimant's contemplation  when  he relocated with regard to the Agreement.
- [171] Under s. 9(c), I am satisfied that the respondent's financial circumstances  are stable and she bears a substantial  responsibility in maintaining  the children  in their activities in the community.  She continues  to shoulder  the greater share  of the children's  expenses; her home is the children's primary residence. The evidence was less than helpful  from the claimant in explaining  how  his costs will change.
- [172]  The Guidelines mandate that the claimant pay $2,734 per month  of child support, and the respondent's offsetting  obligation is $1860. With set off, the claimant would be required to pay $874.
- [173] The respondent  contends that s. 9 of the Guidelines does not compel an automatic reduction in child support when  60/40 balance is achieved. The determination must  be made after considering the criteria in ss. (a) to (c). She relies on Green v. Green 2000 BCCA 310 and Lavoie v. Wills 2000 ABQB 1014 [ Lavoie ].

[174] In Lavoie, the Court considered that the marginal increase in a payor's costs warranted  a small decrease in the support level payable. The respondent in this case argues that the claimant did not prove any reduction in costs and that any reduction should  be in the order of $100.

[175] I  find that the marginal increase in time the children  will be with the claimant does not justify  a full set off of support obligations.

[176] In  spite of the limited information  available, I intend to adjust the claimant's ongoing responsibility to reflect the anticipated modest changes in his expenses relating to the increase in time he cares for the children.

[177] The primary residence of the children  will remain in the respondent's home in accordance with para. 8(2) of the Agreement.  The claimant's monthly  expenses  of $13,474 of which $1767 is specifically allocated to the children's needs. I recognize that the child care expenses may be reduced as a consequence of the decisions made in these reasons. There is no indication that  the respondent's expenses will diminish for any  reason except for the incremental  costs of daily living.

[178] It  is important  to achieve a reasonable balance between the burdens shared by these parents; the respondent will remain responsible for the  children's primary residence. It  is not appropriate to conflate the issues of parenting  time with parental responsibility when  the distance between the parties residences impact on their schooling,  activities and historical connection  with their neighbourhood.

[179] In  the circumstances,  I order that  the claimant pay child support in the amount of $2,000 per month.

## 5. Should any special and extraordinary expenses be reimbursed?

[180] For the reasons that follow,  the claimant will reimburse the respondent  for his proportionate share of child care expenses totalling  $10,182.

[181] The claimant argues that  the respondent  has received substantial contributions  towards extraordinary  and special expenses in the past and has not

provided documentary  confirmation of those expenses. He seeks to recover back the monies he has paid since 2008 where those costs have not been supported by receipts produced to him.

[182] The respondent  deposed that  she paid $13,850 from July  2011 to September 2012 for child care expenses,  including the before and after school daycare and nanny  costs.

- [183] She claims an additional $1,439 for payments to fly  her mother from Britain to Vancouver so that she could provide some additional daycare.
- [184] She contends that the claimant is responsible for a proportionate share of these costs, and he has not paid any portion of those expenses to date.
- [185] The respondent  also alleges that the children  have been involved  in various sporting programs from July  2011 to September 2012. She has spent a total of $4,005 on these costs without  support from the claimant.
- [186] The respondent  deposes that she paid $726 in MSP expenses for the children,  $187 for other medical expenses, and $301 for life insurance.
- [187] The claimant submits that the respondent incurred the daycare expenses and nanny  expenses without  consulting  him and without  his consent,  contrary  to para. 17 of the Agreement.  The claimant also suggested that his obligation to contribute  to expenses related to the children's care by third parties should  be reduced because she claimed those benefits as deductions to her income, and that the parties made an agreement that she would pay for some nanny  costs without  contribution  from him. So he is not obliged to make contributions  to those expenses because the respondent  did not follow the steps required in paras. 15, 17 and 34 of the Agreement.
- [188] The claimant also argues that the characterization  of 'nanny  expenses" in the Agreement ought to be expunged because the respondent's expenditure  on a nanny

duplicates daycare expenses he already pays for. Further  he contends  that daycare expenses could be reduced if the children  were to stay with him over Sunday  nights.

- [189] Further,  the claimant argued that the respondent's mother's flight  costs would have been incurred in any  event,  and they  do not constitute an agreed upon special expense claim.
- [190] The claimant argues that  he has not received the copies of receipts or confirmation  of the respondent's expenditures  from 2008 to 2011, and he alleges that he paid a disproportionate share of those costs without  proper documentation, and now he wants reimbursement  for any expenses he may have paid for which the respondent  is unable to produce the supporting receipts.
- [191] The claimant argues that  he should not be responsible for paying for his son's hockey expenses.  He alleges that the respondent agreed that  she would pay their son's hockey expenses and he would  pay their daughter's  riding costs.
- [192] In  addition, he asserts that his contribution  to RESPs for the children  at the rate of $333 per month  should  be credited to him.  I do not agree.
- [193] RESP plans may be important to provide for the children's  long-term  future. However, those contributions  must be viewed in the context  of the children's day-today needs and expenses.  It may be that financial  planning for the children's  longterm education goals is within the capacity of the parties; it may be a laudable goal. However those issues must generally  be assessed based on the circumstances  of the parties when  the children pursue  post-secondary education and should  not be permitted to relieve a parent from meeting the immediate needs of their children.
- [194] I  accept the claimant's assertion that the respondent  agreed to pay the entirety  of P.M.'s hockey costs because they had no agreement on that activity.  She deposed that she may 'have overlooked consulting'  the claimant regarding some of the children's activities.

[195] And I accepted that the claimant is paying some costs for E.M.'s horse riding activities as part of an understanding  he had with the respondent  that neither would be required to share the others costs of hockey and equestrian activities.

[196] In  addressing the respondent's claim for child care expenses under  the Agreement, I accept that those expenses were reasonable and necessary  in managing the respondent's  household.  The parties agreed to share special and extraordinary  expenses, including  a nanny,  in proportion to their adjusted Guidelines incomes.

[197] The parties had agreed that the respondent would  employ daycare to care for the children in December 2008. Paragraph 34(1)(a) confirms that  a nanny  is a special and extraordinary  expense.

[198] The respondent  claims travel  costs for her mother  coming to Vancouver  from Britain in December 2011, March 2012, July  2012 and September 2012. The total for these charges was $3,668.

[199] The respondent  explained these expenses as necessary  to provide daycare to facilitate the children's care for various  reasons. But the claimant was not consulted  with regard to these expenses. The claimant  argued that the respondent's mother would  have come to provide assistance to her daughter  and for an ordinary visit, and that he should  not be obligated to pay half of that amount.

[200] In  the circumstances,  where the claimant was not consulted  before the decision was made to invite her mother to care for the children,  I am not satisfied that those costs form a proper claim for special or extraordinary  expenses.  I am of the view that the respondent's mother's travel  expenses do not fit within  the description of 'nanny'  costs. Ordinary child care costs have tax benefits or implications to the parties and it is not reasonable, on the limited evidence  available to conclude that the respondent's mother's travel  costs should be considered a special or extraordinary  expense.

[201] The claimant argued that  he should not be responsible for nanny  expenses that were incurred  without  his approval. The Agreement did not predicate his responsibility to share child care expenses based on his consent  to the use of a nanny;  rather the respondent  was obliged to consult  the claimant before selecting a nanny.  She agrees that she did not consult  with the claimant before selecting a nanny;  nanny  costs are a specified expense of the Agreement obviously  in the contemplation  of the parties when  they  entered the  Agreement.

[202] The respondent's failure to consult  the claimant regarding the choice of nanny does not extinguish  his obligation to contribute  to that expense.

[203] The Agreement does not give the Court the authority  to cancel or remove terms relating to child support. Section 148(3) permits the  Court to set aside or replace a child support order if it would  make a different  order on consideration of the matters set out in s. 150 of the Act .

[204] In  my view, child care expenses (including  nanny  costs) remain necessary while the children are in the respondent's  care. In  the circumstances,  I am not convinced  that the respondent's  entitlement  to a contribution  to child care costs while she is at work would  not be included in an order under s. 150. I declined to cancel or remove that term of the Agreement.

[205] However,  I find the claimant must share the costs set out in para. 33 of the respondent's first affidavit, except for $1,562 that was for costs of their son's hockey.

[206] In  the result,  the claimant will reimburse the respondent  for his proportionate share of child care expenses totalling  $10,182.

[207] The division of special and extraordinary  expenses will be in accordance with the proportions based on the parties' incomes as described in these reasons, namely  $200,000 per annum  for the claimant and $130,000 for the respondent.

## 6. Should I make an order that the respondent must increase the amount of her life insurance?

[208] For the reasons that follow have concluded  that the respondent is not obliged to increase her life insurance.

[209] The Agreement required the parties to obtain reciprocal insurance  policies naming the other as beneficiary for as long as the children  are entitled to support.

[210] Under the Agreement, the claimant's policy was to be $500,000, and the respondent's policy was $200,000.

- [211] The claimant seeks an order compelling the respondent  to increase the insurance  coverage required in the Agreement from $200,000 to $500,000.

[212] The Agreement incorporates the parties' obligations to obtain life insurance payable to the other in prescribes amounts  of insurance.  It does not contemplate  a variation of that obligation requiring the respondent  to increase the amount  of insurance.  Further,  the Agreement includes no provision that allows the Court to vary  the Agreement to require an increase in the benefits payable under the respondent's policy. And no authority  was cited to authorize  the imposition of a change in this obligation.

[213] Section 170(e) of the Act authorizes  the Court to make an order against a person who has a contract of life insurance  to designate a spouse or child as a beneficiary and to pay premiums.

[214] But s. 170 is confined to a situation where one spouse already has a contract of life insurance  in place; it does not permit the imposition of an obligation to obtain new or additional insurance  coverage.

[215] There is no authority  to make the requested order; accordingly,  I dismiss that item of the claimant's notice of application.

## 7. Should parenting time be varied?

[216] I  will  not make an order changing the children's primary residence at this time. But I will make an order varying  the time that the children  spend with the claimant.

[217] The claimant seeks a variation in the Agreement that would alter the children's primary residence from the respondent's home to a joint primary residence regime.

[218] The respondent  challenges  the claimant's assertion that the children's best interests will be served by increasing his parenting time in light of his change of residence. She argues that the amount  of time spent travelling  back and forth  to Langley  deprives the children  of important  time for other needs. She contends that the claimant's access time should be reduced to eliminate some of the trips between North  Vancouver  and Langley and suggests that the claimant spend more time with the children in North  Vancouver.

[219] As a result,  she wishes to reduce the number  of evenings the children reside in the claimant's house and requiring the claimant to visit the children on Thursday evenings  in North  Vancouver.

[220] She contends that the claimant acted out in a high handed an irresponsible manner when he moved to Langley without  providing notice under  the Agreement or under the Act .

[221] First, I will address the claimant's obligations preparatory to changing his residence under the Act and under the Agreement.

[222] Sections 65-71 of the Act prescribe the statutory  obligation of a parent who plans to change the location of his residence where such  a change may significantly impact the child's relationship  with a guardian.

[223] Section 65 states:

- 65(1) In this Division, "relocation" means a change in the location of the residence of a child or child's guardian that can reasonably be expected to have a significant impact on the child's relationship with
- (a) a guardian, or
- (b) one or more other persons having a significant role in the child's life.
- (2) This Division applies if
- (a) a child's guardian plans to relocate himself or herself or the child, or both, and
- (b) a written agreement or an order respecting parenting arrangements or contact with the child applies to the child.
- 66(1) Subject to subsection (2), a child's guardian who plans to relocate himself or herself or a child, or both, must give to all other guardians and persons having contact with the child at least 60 days' written notice of
- (a) the date of the relocation, and
- (b) the name of the proposed location.
- 68 If a child's guardian gives notice under section 66 [notice of relocation] that the guardian plans to relocate the child, the relocation may occur on or after the date set out in the notice unless another guardian of the child, within 30 days after receiving the notice, files an application for an order to prohibit the relocation.
- 70(1) If the court makes an order under section 69 [orders respecting relocation] that permits a child's relocation, the court may make any of the following orders:
- (a) subject to subsection (2) of this section, if the order made under section 69 affects an agreement or order that allocates parenting arrangements between the relocating guardian and another guardian, an order under section 45 [orders respecting parenting arrangements] or 47 [changing, suspending or terminating orders respecting parenting arrangements] , as applicable;
- (b) any order necessary to ensure that the relocating guardian complies with the terms of the order permitting relocation, including an order to do one or more of the following:
- (i) give security in any form the court directs;
- (ii) transfer specific property to a trustee named by the court.
- (2) In making an order under subsection (1), the court must seek to preserve, to a reasonable extent, parenting arrangements under the original agreement or order.

[224] Section 69, addresses the case of parties who do not have substantially  equal parenting time (as in this case) s. 69(4) provides:

- (4) If an application is made under this section and the relocating guardian and another guardian do not have substantially equal parenting time with the child,
2. (a) the relocating guardian must satisfy the court that
3. (i) the proposed relocation is made in good faith, and
4. (ii) the relocating guardian has proposed reasonable and workable arrangements to preserve the relationship between the child and the child's other guardians, persons who are entitled to contact with the child, and other persons who have a significant role in the child's life, and
5. (b) on the court being satisfied of the factors referred to in paragraph (a), the relocation must be considered to be in the best interests of the child unless another guardian satisfies the court otherwise.

[225] The initial burden of proof in this case is on the claimant  to prove:

1. the proposed relocation was made in good faith; and,
2. he has proposed reasonable and workable arrangements  to preserve the relationship between the children and the parents and others who have a significant role in the child's life.

[226] If  the relocation meets the two criteria it will be considered in the best interests of the children  unless  the other parent satisfies the Court otherwise.

[227] I  note that  s. 70(2) requires the Court to preserve, to a reasonable extent, parenting arrangements  under  this Agreement.

## Good Faith of the Relocation

[228] The claimant did not give the required 60 days' written  notice of the date and name of the new location of his proposed move. This notice period is intended to allow the parent to apply to court within 30 days of receiving the notice to prohibit the relocation and the relocation cannot occur until on or after the date set out in the notice.

[229] The claimant recognizes he breached the Act and the Agreement when he changed his residence without  prior notice to the respondent.  He argued that these failures were of no consequence  because the respondent would have  refused consent  to the move and he would have been making the application now before the Court.

[230] He did not address the 'good faith' issue in submissions; however  I accept that his reasons for moving were not motivated by an improper purpose although  the timing of his move was improper behaviour.

[231] Nonetheless,  the claimant lives in Langley  nearer to the east boundary  of the district, and he did not provide any evidence to support the choice of residence that far from North Vancouver.

## Reasonable Arrangements Proposed by the Claimant

[232] Although  the claimant has moved to Langley,  he contends  he is able to transport  the children  to their activities in North  Vancouver,  to school and to their mother's home in a timely way.  He wishes to achieve an equal division of the parenting time and responsibilities of the children and believes that their experience in his new residence includes  many advantages he was not previously  able to provide. He argues that he is self-employed  and has a more flexible schedule  that permits him to attend to many of the children's activities. He is prepared to facilitate transportation  of the children to and from Langley and believes that the more parenting time he has with the children,  the more it will improve their lives.

[233] He rejects the respondent's  assertions that the additional transportation between Langley and North Vancouver imposes a negative burden on the children and will have long-term  adverse consequences.

[234] Neither child expressed any concerns about the travel time from the claimant's home to their school or activities in North Vancouver  and both children wish to spend more time with the claimant.

[235] The commute is obviously  a challenge  insofar as North Vancouver  has been the center of the children's community  life since before the parties separated. The parties disagreed on the duration of the trip from Langley  to North  Vancouver.  It  is clearly  within 37 to 50 min.;  the time will obviously  depend on the nature and extent of traffic.

[236] The respondent  described the children's fatigue and challenges  occurring when the children  are awoken early to travel  to their school from Langley.  It  seems obvious that the extra  travel time will impact the children at some level but the competing issues are whether  improved time with their father balances the extra time lost to early morning travel.

[237] It  is important  to reiterate that  the claimant chose to live in Langley without obtaining consent  or giving the requisite notice under the Agreement and the Act .

[238] The circumstances  involving  these children  now include  tension and challenges  to the activity  schedules.  I have no doubt that the increased time driving between their parents residences will impact their lives.  The respondent's home remains the children's primary residence. Many  of their ongoing social, recreational and sporting activities remain in North Vancouver.  Their new Langley  residence will obviously  afford them significant social and recreational activities. It is hard to imagine that, as the children  grow older, the tension between their residence in North  Vancouver  and Langley will not become more stressful.

[239] The claimant's fiancé, Zanet  Benakova, with whom the claimant  resides, seems to be a source of tension and discord according to the children.  Conversely, the respondent's partner seems to have  a good relationship with the children without discord.

[240] To achieve the optimum balance between both residences, the new arrangements will undoubtedly  impact the children's activities in North Vancouver and may result in some limitations on their options.

[241] I  accept that the claimant wishes to expand his time with the children to the level where he is parenting the children 50% of the time.

[242] I  also recognize that the children  wish to have more time with their father.

[243] Nonetheless,  the claimant's decision to move to Langley,  without  apparently considering accommodation that would be closer to North  Vancouver,  is completely unexplained  and unreasonable.

[244] The reality is that by moving to Langley the claimant has introduced a further burden on the children's time that could and might have been assessed before moving.

[245] In  my view, the claimant will not be able to achieve equal parenting with the respondent  while he continues  to reside in Langley.

[246] To expect that the children will commute from Langley  to their North Vancouver schools on an ongoing basis is both unreasonable  and unnecessary.

[247] Although  such an arrangement  might be feasible, it would significantly  impact the children's time. They  could sit in their father's car for up to one-and-a-half  to two hours per day - if not more in rush  hour traffic. The question is whether  the benefits outweigh  the detrimental  impact on the children.  I am not satisfied that it would  be appropriate to change the children's primary residence at this time. The children may want more time with their father;  but it is difficult  to conceive of a plan that could accommodate more evenings in their father's home without  requiring substantially increased travel to their school and activities.

[248] In  my view the claimant will need to demonstrate  flexibility  with regard to the children's  activities in North  Vancouver.  That  is their primary residence in the place that they  have been raised. The additional advantages resulting  from his new residence must be secondary  to the children's  need for a primary residence.

[249] I  have concluded that  there is a very  narrow balance favouring  the children's continued  time in the claimant's home notwithstanding  the drawbacks of prolonged

travelling.  It would  be best for the parties to create a schedule that  minimizes the number of trips. In the absence of such agreement this order will settle the ongoing parenting schedule.

[250] In  the result,  I order that the claimant's parenting time will be:

Weeks one and three:

Wednesday 3:00 pm to 7:00 pm and Thursday 3:00 pm to Monday 9:00 am;

Weeks two and four: Thursday  3:00 pm to Friday 3:00 pm.

[251] In  my view, this schedule will result  in the children  travelling  from Langley to North  Vancouver  eight mornings per month  and will minimize the disruption in the children's lives and will give them better quality time with their father on the alternating  weekends.

[252] If  after April 2015 either party wishes to revisit the parenting schedule  solely because all of the adverse effects of travel on the children,  they  are at liberty to seek a further  review of this schedule.  I am very  hesitant  at suggesting a return  to Court to solve problems for this family; they  should  be solved between the parties. However in the absence of an agreement the parties are at liberty to apply to change this schedule.

## 8. Should I appoint a parenting coordinator?

[253] For the reasons that follow,  I am appointing a parenting coordinator.

[254] In  my view, the nature  and extent  of the  parties' affidavit material on this application indicates their inability to achieve rational compromise to important questions involving  their children.

[255] Court applications are expensive,  cumbersome and at times unhelpful  in solving the real problems concerning  the care or parenting of children.

[256] I  am satisfied that this family  will benefit by the use of a parenting coordinator as provided for in s. 15 of the Act .

[257] I  am satisfied that it is in the best interests of the  children  that some flexibility remains in the parenting arrangements  provided for under  the Agreement and this order.

[258] The parenting coordinator is to make determinations  regarding:

1. scheduling  of children's activities;
2. variations regarding the children's pick-up or drop-off time; and
3. substitution  of parenting time where it would be in the best interests of the children to be with one or the other parent on times that  do not conform to the order and the Agreement between the parties.

[259] I  recognize that there may need to be additional terms authorizing  parenting coordinator to act. The parties may wish to address those terms or refining the details in paragraph 257. The parties will have liberty to apply for further  directions or alterations in this order for the appointment  of a parenting coordinator.

## Other Claims

[260] The claimant sought  orders relating to communication  between the parties regarding the children and contact  between the parties when the children  are picked up or dropped off.

[261] The respondent  wanted communications  with respect to the children  to be limited to e-mail and text messages only.  Although  e-mail and text  messaging is an efficient process to communicate  information,  it is difficult to contemplate  why  the parties cannot  have direct communication  this many  years after separation. It must surely  be in the best interest of the children  that the parties be able to communicate orally.

[262] I  will  direct that the exchange  of information regarding the children's  needs, education and health  be dealt with by e-mails or text  messages. Other than  that restriction I will not attempt to regulate the behavior of either party.

[263] The circumstances  of this family do not suggest that violence is a factor or that the children are at risk from exchanges between the parties. The impact of a court order restraining one party's activities is serious and should not be invoked to control conversations  occurring when  the children  are exchanged.

[264] The affidavit evidence is somewhat  contradictory  on this point and, if the claimant's version of events  is accurate, does not warrant  judicial intervention.

## Conclusion

[265] I  order:

1. the respondent's application to enforce the Agreement be allowed with respect to child support payments  and special and extraordinary payments based on the claimant's Guidelines income imputed to be $200,000 from June 1, 2013 to the present;
