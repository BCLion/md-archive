## INTRODUCTION

- [1] S.S.W. is a six-year-old boy who has been in Ministry care since birth and who is presently in a concurrent foster placement located in Abbotsford, B.C. He lives with A.L. and B.L. (the 'Foster Parents') and has been with them since October 18, 2023. In total, since birth, S.S.W. has lived with four different families, none of which have included his birth parents, G.W. and R.O. (the 'Parents'). His most recent placement with the L.'s is his longest established home.
- [2] The Director of Child Welfare (the 'Director') applies pursuant to s. 49(9) of the Child, Family and Community Services Act , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 46 [ CFCSA ] for an order that S.S.W. be placed in their continuing custody. The effect of that order would result in extinguishing the Parents' guardianship rights over S.S.W. and conferring his personal guardianship on the Director and his property guardianship on the Public Guardian and Trustee: see CFCSA s. 50(1). The present application was made by the Director following the expiration of a six-month temporary custody order made pursuant to s. 49(7) of the CFCSA on January 31, 2024 at the conclusion of a trial pertaining to the Director's first continuing custody application. The January 31, 2024 order is known as a 'Last Chance Order' because a failure to comply may result in the imposition of a Continuing Custody Order.
- [3] The Parents oppose the order sought by the Director. They collectively submit that the Court should dismiss the Director's application and, after balancing the factors outlined in s. 49(6), order S.S.W. be returned to them. They argue that no child protection concerns presently exist and he should return to their care as the family is the preferred environment for his upbringing.
- [4] A substantial body of evidence was put before the Court in support of the Director's case. Marcy Miletech, the Parents' most recent family service social worker, Cherie Birner, S.S.W.'s most recent guardianship social worker and A.L., S.S.W.'s foster mother all testified on the Director's application. Additionally, and by consent, transcripts of the continuing custody trial held in October and December 2023 along with the January 31, 2024 Reasons for Judgement were admitted into evidence without

the need to recall witnesses. G.W. testified on his own behalf and called his adult son, J.S.W. R.O. testified on her own behalf and called a friend, A.T. Several documents were marked as exhibits, including family plans, drug screening results, correspondence, parenting program reports, a sensory assessment, and supervised visitation reports.

- [5] I have considered all of the evidence presented in this trial, but will only reference that which I feel necessary to express these reasons.

## BACKGROUND - CHILD PROTECTION HISTORY

## A.  S.S.W.'s Birth and his Siblings

- [6] S.S.W. was born on [omitted for publication]. He is presently six-years old and has four maternal half-siblings: S.J.O. (27), S.L.E. (23), S.B.M. (16), and S.D.M. (11), along with one step-sibling, S.H. who goes by M. (16). He has one paternal half-brother, J.S.W. (30). J.S.W., S.J.O., S.L.E. and M. live independently, while S.B.M. and S.D.M. live with their father in Vanderhoof, B.C. S.S.W. has never lived with his birth parents.

## B.  S.S.W.'s Removal from his Parents' Care

- [7] While Ms. O. was pregnant with S.S.W., she and Mr. W. were living in the Mission area, off-grid in a fifth-wheel trailer. During her pregnancy, the Ministry received reports that she was using illicit substances and, upon investigation, it was determined that she had not accessed any prenatal care. This information prompted the Ministry to issue a birth alert to hospitals, a practice that is no longer used in this province. The birth alert meant that once Ms. O. attended a hospital, the Ministry would be alerted so they might assess any child protection concerns.
- [8] When S.S.W. was born, hospital staff informed the Ministry in response to the birth alert. According to the documents filed at the presentation hearing, Ms. O. was displaying concerning behaviour to the hospital staff and with the social workers who attended to speak with her. She denied drug use but admitted to using marijuana while pregnant and lied about seeing a doctor and living with Mr. W. She then refused to

permit hospital staff to conduct tests on S.S.W. for the presence of drugs which, ultimately, required police intervention. S.S.W. subsequently tested positive for amphetamines and methamphetamines, as did Ms. O. At the time of his removal, the child protection concerns included Ms. O.'s substance abuse/dependency, the lack of safe and stable housing, the Parents' inability to manage resources and the Parents' need for mental health and parenting supports. Around the same time S.S.W. was born, Mr. W. suffered a significant heart attack.

- [9] S.S.W. remained in the hospital neo-natal intensive care unit until his discharge and placement into a concurrent foster home located in Hope, B.C. (the 'Hope Placement'). He was placed in Hope because of Ms. O.'s longstanding ties to that community and the Ministry's uncertainty as to where she and Mr. W. would be residing, owing largely to information that came to light suggesting they may move. Ms. O.'s parents also lived in Hope as did her other children, albeit not in her care. Ms. O.'s parents were not identified as appropriate caregivers at removal because they refused to acknowledge any of the child protection concerns that existed, and despite being invited to meetings involving S.S.W.'s care post removal, did not express a willingness to participate.
- [10] While in the Hope Placement, the Parents had regular supervised visitation with S.S.W. and he saw his extended family, including his maternal grandparents and his siblings, on a weekly basis while at family dinners held at Ms. O.'s parents' home. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, in-person visitations with S.S.W. ceased and the Parents, instead, had daily video calls with him. Ms. O. testified in these proceedings that not seeing S.S.W. in person was very difficult for them, but they managed to maintain a bond with him through the daily video calls. When restrictions were lifted, the Parents agreed to be vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus so that in-person visits could resume. In-person supervised visits did eventually resume and the Parents attended them with regular frequency. Despite requests by the Parents, visitations did not increase in frequency because of their unwillingness to fully engage with the Ministry to address the child protection concerns.

- [11] In March 2023, the Hope Placement no longer became viable when the foster parents advised they could no longer care for S.S.W. long term and when social workers became concerned with discipline practices inside that home. S.S.W. was then placed with two other homes - one from March until June 2023 and the other from June until October 2023. It was on October 18, 2023 that S.S.W. came to live with the L.'s.
- [12] After S.S.W. left Hope, his attendance at the family dinners decreased and by December 2023 they ceased because of concerns about the Parents taking S.S.W. unsupervised into the community and to their trailer. The Parents also had not met with the Foster Parents, a meeting the Ministry wanted to occur to ensure transitions were done in a safe and stable manner for S.S.W. Supervised visits, however, did continue.
- [13] Not long after S.S.W. moved to Abbotsford, weekly visits with the Parents moved from Chilliwack to Abbotsford. The main reason for this move was because S.S.W. would become ill while travelling in the car from his home in Abbotsford to the visit site in Chilliwack. The Parents agreed to the change in location provided the Ministry was willing to compensate them for the additional fuel expenditure they would have with the weekly commute from Hope to Abbotsford. An arrangement was made where the Ministry provided the Parents money towards fuel and the Parents continued with their regular supervised visits. The Parents each testified on this hearing that the amount of money the Ministry provided did not sufficiently cover the entirety of the additional expense and they were required to offset this cost out of their own pocket. Aside from one administrative error that occurred that resulted in delayed payment, I am satisfied that the Ministry made good on their financial arrangement with the Parents in this regard.
- [14] In addition to the weekly visits, A.L. organized some video calls between the Parents and S.S.W. when in-person visits were not possible and has shared photographs and updates about S.S.W. with the Parents electronically.

## C.  Initial Efforts to Mitigate Child Protection Concerns

- [15] Following S.S.W.'s removal, family plans were developed with Ministry social workers and the Parents to address the child protection concerns. The Ministry, for their part, offered the Parents several supports to help them including connecting them with counsellors, support workers and, at times, financial support.
- [16] Regrettably, the Parents struggled to work on remedying the child protection concerns and making progress on the family plans. They regularly cancelled meetings with social workers, did not permit home visits, did not attend counselling, missed drug testing appointments, did not secure safe and suitable housing that could support a child, and did not complete the required parenting support programming. Ms. O. did not maintain sobriety or attend counselling, nor did she take any steps to obtain identification - the lack of which presented barriers to easily accessing services that could only help her overcome the protection concerns.
- [17] While the Parents continued with their supervised visits with S.S.W., their actions otherwise made it nearly impossible for the Ministry to help them address any of the child protection concerns that remained outstanding. Accordingly, in September 2020, the Director filed an application pursuant to s. 40 of the CFCSA for an order finding that S.S.W. was a child in need of protection and pursuant to s. 49(5) for an order that S.S.W. be placed in the continuing custody of the Director. Despite this application being filed and served on the Parents, their willingness to cooperate with social workers to address the child protection concerns did not change. When efforts were made to work with them, excuses consistently were put forward to explain away their intentional non-compliance and lack of engagement.

## D.  Director's First Continuing Custody Application

- [18] The trial for the Director's first continuing custody application did not commence until 2023 and proceeded over three days in October and one day in December. By this point, S.S.W. was over four years old. The hearing was scheduled and adjourned at least twice owing to changes in counsel and adjournment requests by the Parents.

In the months leading up to the trial, S.S.W. suffered significant disruptions to his stability, having been moved three times. It is no wonder that he suffered anxiety and trauma from that experience given his tender age.

- [19] During that hearing, the Director provided the Court evidence about the child protection history with the Parents vis-à-vis S.S.W., along with Ms. O.'s history involving her other children. Ms. O. has never independently raised a child of her own into adulthood. Her two eldest children were placed in voluntary care and ultimately on extended youth agreements, her step-daughter was removed from her care for failure to thrive and her second youngest children now live with their father, but had been previously removed from her care on more than one occasion owing to her substance misuse and the danger it presented them.
- [20] At the time of the first hearing, the Director's Plan of Care was for S.S.W. to remain in the placement with the L.'s, a place he had been for a few weeks and to ultimately move towards his adoption, if the Continuing Custody Order were granted. The L.'s were willing to adopt him at that time and no other family member had come forward as a suitable caregiver. It was the Director's position that there was no significant likelihood that the circumstances which lead to S.S.W.'s removal would improve within a reasonable time or that the Parents would be able to meet his needs, therefore the Continuing Custody Order was in S.S.W.'s best interests.
- [21] The Parents testified on their own behalf. They took issue with how the Ministry approached resolving the child protection concerns and felt they were never given a fair opportunity to get their son back.
- [22] A review of the evidence establishes that while they may have felt that, both parents were simply unwilling to work with their social worker and could not consistently and meaningfully engage with the supports put in place for them to make progress on the family plan. The evidence suggests they were only prepared to work with the Ministry on their terms which ultimately amounted to little being accomplished. The evidence established the Parents were unreliable and inconsistent. They took exception with their social worker, did not regularly attend meetings or permit home visits, and

refused to provide information to the social worker. They stopped attending care team meetings for S.S.W. and stopped engaging in programming. Various excuses were given; however the cumulative effect of their actions illustrated a general inability to follow through with their obligations.

- [23] For unknown reasons, it took until the last scheduled day of the first hearing for the Parents to seemingly grasp the seriousness of the proceedings - that a Continuing Custody Order would extinguish their guardianship rights and transfer S.S.W. permanently into the Director's custody. On that day they advised the Court they were able to secure what they say was safe and stable housing. They told the Court they had found an apartment to rent, but needed time to present proof of the circumstances of the lease and, therefore, needed an adjournment. Prior to that, the Parents were living in a fifth wheel trailer with no running water. The Court permitted the adjournment. In doing so, the Court highlighted the seriousness of their situation and the impact delayed

proceedings had on S.S.W. The Court noted:

- [7] … I reach my decision on this point on the basis of this being the most severe application that the Director can bring. The Continuing Custody Order application. The application is to extinguish the parents' parental rights. It does not get more serious than that. …
- [8] … I feel compelled to give these parents every opportunity to put forth the best case possible in these circumstances. Doing so, is an inconvenience to the court. It is going to extend the matter that is antithetical to some of the principles of the CFCSA . Children, like S.S.W., have a right to have these issues concluded in a reasonable period of time. He is four and a half years old and still in care from the day he was born. So, we are already running afoul of some of the basic principles underpinning this Act .

[ British Columbia (Director of Child, Family and Community Services) v. G.P.W. , (1 November 2023), Chilliwack F-14770 (BCPC) at paras. 7-8.]

- [24] Following the adjournment, the Parents changed course and pursued securing a trailer in a mobile home park just outside of Hope, the location where they remain today. The Parents did not communicate anything to the social worker about the change in living arrangements nor a significant issue that was later identified with the apartment arrangement they advised the Court of. Unbeknownst to the social worker, the

apartment plan appeared to involve the landlord living in the unit with the Parents and S.S.W., if he was returned to their care. The Director knew nothing about this landlord and their suitability to be around a young child. It was not until the social worker was attempting to follow up with the apartment landlord that she discovered what that living arrangement was going to look like, along with the move to the trailer and the identity of the trailer's landlord. In a discussion with that landlord, she learned that the trailer would require renovations to make it suitable for a child, renovations that she was told would be undertaken by himself and Mr. W. The Parents were less than forthcoming with any of this critical information to the social worker.

[25] During closing submissions on December 21, 2024, an interaction between the Court, counsel and the Parents occurred while the Court was being urged to make the Last Chance Order; one that, parenthetically, I would say could not have more clearly brought home to the Parents the seriousness of their circumstances and the Court's expectations going forward if the Last Chance Order were to be granted. The Court expressed the expectation that the Parents immediately change their approach and meaningfully work with the Director:

THE COURT: So again, my thought was I just want them to know. If the parties -- or the parents are saying, "We now will work with the Director, we now have a better understanding that this is -- that our ability to parent our child is hanging by a thread here and the barrier to moving forward is our reticence working with [the social worker]," or whomever is assigned, if they understand that they now cannot continue on that track. They cannot come back in six months and say, "Well, we tried but it didn't work," or "we didn't [indiscernible] phone calls," or "we didn't see them coming to our house," or "we couldn't make that appointment," that sort of, the arrow has left the bow and that is a sort of way of dealing with these issues. There's just no more -- that's what a last chance order is. There are no more chances.

[26] In response to these comments, each parent told the Court they were committed to doing anything that was necessary to ensure the Last Chance Order was a potential outcome for them and to avoid the Continuing Custody Order being made.

[27] On January 31, 2024, the Court gave its reasons denying the Director's application and imposed the Last Chance Order. In those reasons, the Court found that

- S.S.W. was a child in need of protection at the time of removal and remained so at the time of the hearing, and that the Parents' efforts to mitigate the protection concerns had not been successful to date. However, the Court could not conclude that there was no significant likelihood that the circumstances would improve within a reasonable time or that the Parents would not be able to meet S.S.W.'s needs, as they had, albeit late in the day, secured housing and confirmed a willingness to re-engage with the social workers, participate in random drug screening, attend meetings, revisit programming and permit social workers into their home as deemed necessary: British Columbia (Director of Child, Family and Community Services) v. G.P.W (31 January 2024), Chilliwack F-14770 (BCPC) [ Last Chance Reasons ] at paras. 88-89. The Court then went on to hold:
- [90] I wish to be very clear with the parents. This is their last opportunity to show that they can and will do what is required to demonstrate their ability to parent S.W. If they continue their past conduct of active or passive resistance with social workers, in my view, there will be no further options available other than a continuing custody order.
- [91] They must re-engage with social workers and address the concerns that have been identified. They must not miss any further meetings, home visits, or drug screens. The litany of explanations and excuses offered will not be tolerated. They must open their home for inspection and maintain it to community standards. In short, they must do all that is asked of them by social workers.

[ Last Chance Reasons , at paras. 90-91.]

## PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES - PARENTS' EFFORTS FOLLOWING THE LAST CHANCE ORDER

## A.  Post-Hearing Cooperation with Social Workers

- [28] Marcy Miletech, a social worker with the Ministry, testified at the present hearing that she became the Parents' family service social worker following the pronouncement of the Last Chance Order. She took over the file, in part, because of the concerns expressed by the Parents at the first hearing about their previous social worker, Emily Shantz, and the Director's desire to avoid conflict and provide the Parents a different person to work with.

[29] In this role, Ms. Miletech's responsibilities included working with the Parents to provide ongoing support and referrals to services aimed at mitigating the child protection concerns. In doing so, she developed a family plan with the Parents - a document that identifies the Parents' top three needs with associated goals, success indicators and strategies - which monitors the family plan's progress and meets with the Parents and their support providers with the ultimate goal of reunification.

[30] Ms. Miletech told the Court that following the first hearing, she met with the Parents and their support worker, Tracy Kingdon, inside their home on February 5, 2024. At that time, the trailer was in considerable disrepair. Steps were rotting, the roof was leaking, there was water stains and molding on the walls, there was no proper furnishings, electricity only existed on one side of the home, the water tank was exposed and the home smelled of cigarettes and animal urine. They discussed the Last Chance Order during this visit and the Court's expectations for the Parents as well as strategies to achieve the Order's objectives. That was the last and only time the Parents permitted Ms. Miletech inside the home.

[31] On March 6, 2024, Ms. Miletech met with the Parents at the Ministry office to review the family plan. Ms. Miletech testified that the family plan was based on the preexisting protection concerns and was informed by the Court's Last Chance Order. She told the Court that while normally these plans are done collaboratively with parents, the Last Chance Reasons were clear as to what was expected of the Parents and this largely guided the plan's development. The goals identified in the family plan included addressing Ms. O.'s alcohol/substance use concerns through drug testing and counselling, managing the family's resources by keeping safe housing and obtaining a stable income, and working on parenting skills by attending programming to assist them with supporting S.S.W. and ensuring his physical, social and emotional needs are met. The Parents reviewed the family plan and signed off on it. A formal review of the family plan was scheduled for July 2024 to re-assess the goals and strategies designed to alleviate the child protection concerns. During the March 6, 2024 meeting, Ms. O. advised Ms. Miletech that their home was no longer habitable, that the landlord took their money and was being uncooperative with making repairs and they would be

searching for housing in Abbotsford or Mission. She also advised Ms. Miletech that she was sober and had stopped drinking or using any illicit substances.

## B.  Steps Taken by the Parents Towards Addressing the Family Plan

[32] Within the first two months of the imposition of the Last Chance Order, it appears the Parents were willing to re-engage with social workers and follow through with what was required of them. Unfortunately, that engagement and cooperation did not last long as it started breaking down after the March 6, 2024 meeting. The only thing that ever remained consistent was the Parent's maintaining their weekly visits with S.S.W.

## i.  Random Drug Testing

[33] Following the March 6, 2024 meeting, the Parents were required to continue with random drug testing. They failed to do so with any regularity and, despite being requested to do so, had not completed a random drug test since April 2024. Consistent with the evidence of Ms. Shantz at the first hearing, documentation between Ms. Miletech and the Parents contained in Exhibit 1 - the Director's Book of Documents - illustrates a litany of excuses for failing to engage or cooperate with Ms. Miletech on this point. Mr. W. testified on this hearing that he felt the tests were pointless and unnecessary. Ms. O. blamed Mr. W. for not receiving requests through their shared phone and email address, although admitted to intentionally not attending them as she felt 'rebellious'.

[34] Ms. Miletech told the Court that she attempted to address the non-compliance with the Parents and was met with hostility. This was confirmed by written communications provided to the Court, in particular emails and text messages sent by Ms. O. Ms. Miletech also told the Court that the Parents wanted their support worker, Ms. Kingdon, included in all communications regarding drug testing because Ms. O. felt that Ms. Kingdon was a good source of support for her, could easily get in contact with her, and could help transport her to the testing site when needed. Because Ms. O. did not have any identification, a social worker who knew her had to witness her attendance at the drug testing site, making scheduling less flexible. Ms. O. was advised of this and

how helpful having identification would be for her; however, she never followed through with obtaining it, despite offers to help. Ms. O. never explained why she still has yet to obtain proper identification, something that could reduce some of the barriers she faces with accessing services and achieving stability in the community.

[35] Ms. Miletech did eventually start to include Ms. Kingdon on the communications requesting drug testing to accommodate the Parents. This did nothing to assist in obtaining their compliance. In total, 15 random drug tests were requested of the Parents, with the last being in June 2025, a little over one month prior to this hearing. While I accept that on at least one occasion the notice for the random drug testing seemed to be very sudden, I am satisfied that the majority of the efforts made by the social worker to address this strategy were well intentioned and reasonable given the child protection concerns and the overall lack of progress by the Parents in addressing them. Sadly, Ms. O. and Mr. W. chose not to cooperate. Mr. W. took exception with his need for testing and Ms. O. told the Court she was feeling 'rebellious' as she 'felt it was unnecessary at times'.

## ii. Drug and Alcohol Counselling

[36] As part of managing the substance misuse concerns, Ms. O. was also required to engage with a drug and alcohol counsellor to ensure she had a proper relapse prevention program in place, and to provide feedback to the Ministry about Ms. O.'s success in maintaining sobriety. Ms. Miletech testified that she canvassed this strategy with Ms. O. and while Ms. O. expressed an unwillingness to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, she was willing to work with a drug and alcohol counsellor in Hope. The two settled on an individual who later told Ms. Miletech that Ms. O. only had one brief contact with her in April 2024 about scheduling a time to meet, and then subsequently never hearing from her. Ms. O. provided no real explanation for failing to engage with the drug and alcohol counsellor; however, did testify that she was connected with a sponsor she had in the community and tendered her relapse prevention plan into evidence. While a version of her relapse prevention plan had previously been provided to the Ministry, Ms. O. did not provide any information to Ms.

Miletech about the identity of the sponsor so she could follow up and assess whether Ms. O. had made any meaningful progress on this aspect of the family plan, or was, in fact, abstaining from alcohol and drugs.

## iii. Obtaining a Steady Income Source

[37] Since the first hearing, the Parents have each obtained steady income by applying for income assistance. In addition to their income assistance, Mr. W. does odd manual jobs primarily related to hauling items around the trailer park for the park manager for little pay and at random intervals. Ms. O. testified she owns a small cleaning company, although the frequency in which she works remains uncertain to the Court. It appears that the additional work done by the Parents is the same as what they did to support themselves at the time of the first hearing. The Parents never applied for any stable employment or attended any employment program, strategies identified in the family plan to assist them with resource management and becoming able to meet S.S.W.'s basic needs. The evidence before me suggests that the Parents are both capable of seeking and maintaining employment and neither suffers from any illness or disability that may make employment impossible for them.

## iv. Parenting Skills Programming

[38] Ms. Miletech advised the Court that efforts were also made to connect the Parents with parenting programming. In February 2024, this programming commenced with Ms. Kingdon and the Parents engaged throughout February, March and April 2024; however, by May 2024 their participation waned and by June 2024 they stopped contact with Ms. Kingdon altogether. Given the Parents' disengagement, Ms. Kingdon terminated her connection with them at the beginning of July 2024 and they never did complete the parenting programming. Ms. O. testified that during that time period, her father fell ill and that was where she chose to focus all of her energy.

[39] To alternatively address this component of the family plan and work with the Parents, social workers connected them to parenting classes at the agency supervising their visits with S.S.W. The classes would occur immediately before or after their

scheduled visits with him and would not use any of their visitation time. The Parents expressed a willingness to engage; however, their actions demonstrated otherwise. Parenting classes were frequently missed owing to their showing up late or were cancelled at the last minute because the Parents had other obligations they said required their attention.

## v.  Meetings with the Social Worker and Home Visits

[40] The Parents demonstrated a general unwillingness to work with social workers in any aspect that involved a meeting or inspecting their home. While they communicated they were willing to work with social workers, their actions demonstrated the opposite as being true.

[41] Ms. Miletech advised the Court that Ms. O. had requested care team meetings be recommenced to discuss S.S.W. These meetings brought together the social workers, service providers, the Parents and the Foster Parents in order to put everyone on the same page when it came to S.S.W.'s care. Notes of the meetings were taken and then distributed to all attendees and to those who could not attend.

[42] Despite those meetings being set up and the parties being assembled, the Parents frequently did not attend them and complained about being left in the dark when it came to what was discussed. Ms. O. conceded in cross-examination that she was aware of meeting dates and had the meeting notes about what was discussed when she did not attend. Further, Ms. Miletech testified that she requested several meetings with the Parents to discuss their progress on the family plan, and the requests would go unanswered or the Parents would never follow through with them.

[43] Consistent with their approach to requests by Ms. Shantz, the Parents did not permit Ms. Miletech to make any home visits after the initial February 2024 meeting. Instead, they would agree to visits, then cancel or would not follow through with scheduling them. When Ms. Miletech attempted to visit unannounced, nobody would answer the door. Home visits were requested even at the time this hearing was underway, and no arrangements were agreed to by the Parents. The end result of the

Parents' unwillingness to permit Ms. Miletech to visit the home was that it became impossible for her to assess its state and suitability for a child. The Parents' actions, or rather inaction, completely obstructed the ability of the social workers to monitor and support the Parents with achieving any meaningful progress on a key safety component of the family plan.

[44] Ms. O. called her friend, A.T., to testify about the state of her home. Ms. T. told the Court that while she had known Mr. W. for many years and Ms. O. for almost one year, she had only been in the trailer park for a couple of weeks as she was there because of the recent passing of her stepson. She told the Court that while at the trailer park, she witnessed Mr. W. and Ms. O. make some renovations on the trailer, although she could not advise as to what was being addressed. She did, however, feel the home was suitable for a six year old to live in. The time period Ms. T. was at the trailer park accords with a two week court break that occurred during this hearing. Ms. T. normally lives in [omitted for publication], B.C. and it does not appear she will be remaining in Hope long term.

[45] Given Ms. T.'s lack of knowledge about the child protection history in this matter and her limited recent observations, I accord her evidence little weight.

## vi. July 2024 Meeting to Review the Family Plan

[46] In July 2024, a meeting was held with the social workers, the Parents and legal counsel to discuss the Parents' lack of progress on the family plan and review the goals and strategies. By that point, the Last Chance Order had expired and the Director was obligated to commence proceedings and pursue the Continuing Custody Order.

[47] That meeting did not go well and resulted in the Parents cutting it short and leaving once they heard that the Director had filed the necessary paperwork for the present application. The Parents did not provide any opportunity for the social workers to discuss a path forward.

## C.  Parents' Evidence About their Efforts on the Last Chance Order

[48] The evidence provided by the social worker was largely unchallenged and the Parents' testimony mostly consisted of providing explanations for their inaction and lack of meaningful engagement in the period following the first hearing.

## i.  G.P.W.

- [49] Mr. W. testified about the state of their trailer, advising the Court the yard was 'a little busy with a lot of things piled up' as they were still trying to renovate the home at the time of the hearing. He told the Court that the leaky roof and mold have been remedied and the appliances now work. He testified that he collects income assistance and does odd jobs on the side with his flat-deck trailer. He acknowledged there were problems with making rent payments; however, that seems to be cleared up. He testified that he no longer smokes, he doesn't drink, and he has a good relationship with his son J.S.W. and Ms. O.'s other children and her parents.
- [50] Mr. W. testified that there has been a logistical and financial impact to the Parents as a result of moving S.S.W.'s visits from Chilliwack to Abbotsford. Nonetheless, he testified they regularly make it to the visits where they bond with their son, playing games and bringing him food that he enjoys. The Parents' current visits with S.S.W. involve travelling different countries through the food they bring to their

visits.

- [51] Mr. W. testified that Ms. O. is the primary person who arranges things with the social workers and the support worker and has no real explanation for missed meetings or not letting Ms. Miletech into their home. He told the Court he made no efforts himself to re-engage with Ms. Kingdon after she withdrew her services. He acknowledged not completing the courses required of him, acknowledged the lack of home visits, and he took exception to the family plan as it was not collaborative enough for him. He advised that he did not like working with Ms. Miletech and felt that the Ministry was not committed to their reunification with S.S.W.

## ii.  R.A.O.

[52] Ms. O. testified about her previous experiences with the Ministry as it related to her other children and how those experiences were different and more positive than her experience with S.S.W. She described the challenges she faced with her addiction, her efforts to address and overcome them, and the circumstances that drove her into addiction and triggered her relapses. She testified that, at the time of this hearing, she was clean and sober and had been for some time.

[53] She acknowledged that she did not cooperate with the Ministry and now realizes how big of a mistake that was. She told the Court she ultimately only wants what was in S.S.W.'s best interests and knows that would not be the case with his immediate return to her, however, a gradual return with Ministry support and supervision could be. She says it has been a challenging few years but she is determined to prove herself and would like the chance to be a mother. She says she would commit to working with the Ministry and accessing their support if S.S.W. was returned to her.

[54] Ms. O. testified about how she did not feel the Ministry was ever interested in returning S.S.W. to her care and that was hard for her and Mr. W., who she describes as an excellent father. She talked about how she maintains a close relationship with her eldest daughter and, at times, cares for her granddaughter - showing that she is capable of safely having a child in her care. She says she has the ability to provide a safe, stable home for S.S.W. and she has taken steps to ensure he has the things he needs including a bedroom, age appropriate toys and clothes, and even some hockey equipment as she learned he likes to play hockey.

[55] Ms. O. explained that she did not let social workers into her home because she was scared it would not be good enough for them. She acknowledged that the only way to know if it was sufficient was to let them in and if issues existed, they could have helped identify what was needed to make the home suitable for a child. She said she stopped engaging with social workers and programming to some extent because her father fell ill and that, aside from S.S.W., became 'the most important thing in the world' for her.

- [56] While she does not work steadily, she volunteers in her community, singing at a local service organization. Ms. O. described her future plans - to get more sustainable employment, go back to school, become a care aid and even go to law school, and she hopes to have more time with her grandchildren at her own place and even host her family there. While she has many plans for the future, she has not taken any steps to realize upon any of them.
- [57] In cross-examination, Ms. O. acknowledges she embellished Mr. W.'s employment status in an email to the social worker. She acknowledged that she did not follow through with things like attending counselling and meeting with social workers and other professionals and she acknowledged she did not provide any information about collateral contacts such as her sponsor to the social worker. She blamed Mr. W. for several instances where she says she was unaware of the requests for drug tests or home visits, although that evidence seems to be somewhat contradicted by the written communications between her and Ms. Miletech as well as the evidence of Mr. W.

## S.S.W. AND HIS NEEDS

- [58] As much as the decision I make on this hearing impacts the Parents' rights, central to my decision is the best interests of S.S.W., a now six-year-old boy who has lived in Ministry care since his removal at birth.
- [59] It is clear to me that despite his life starting off bleak, S.S.W. is a child who, unlike many in his situation, has been very fortunate. While he has never lived with his birth parents, he has a strong bond with them. He has several siblings and extended family members that he knows of and has met, as well as extended family he met through the foster placements he has lived in.
- [60] At the time he came into the L.'s home, S.S.W. was suffering from trauma caused by the significant disruption that had occurred in his life in the months preceding their home. He feared being moved and losing attachments he made to people. However, through therapy and the stability provided by the L.'s his anxiety has dissipated and he is thriving. Ms. L. took a year off work when S.S.W. came into their

care to help him adjust, settle and focus on addressing his anxiety and other needs. She worked on developing his social connections and engaged him in a Montessori preschool where he met his current 'best friend'.

- [61] Despite being exposed to illicit substances in utero, S.S.W.'s development has not been largely impacted. While there were concerns about potential sensory issues, an assessment conducted in March 2024 reveals no sensory, concentration or other developmental needs and Ms. L. continues to work with him daily to progress his dexterity and coordination. He has been described as highly intelligent, an above age level reader, he does well with math concepts, and is a very social child.
- [62] S.S.W. has interests in athletics and learning. He currently attends elementary school, has made close friends, plays soccer and hockey, has participated in swimming lessons, and is involved in the Beaver Scouts.
- [63] S.S.W. is bonded with his birth parents and the Foster Parents. He thrives on his routine, one that involves many pro-social activities that help develop him physically along with his social skills and academics. He has expressed comfort and a desire to stay permanently in the L.'s home. He has expressed a fear of the disruption a move would have to his life. He refers to his birth parents as 'mom and dad' or 'R. and G.', and he refers to the Foster Parents as 'mom and dad'.

## LEGAL FRAMEWORK

## A.  Nature of Protection Proceedings and Evidentiary Burden

- [64] In B.B. v. British Columbia (Director of Child, Family and Community Services) , 2005 BCCA 46 [ B.B. ], the Court of Appeal discussed the nature of child protection proceedings and the evidentiary burden on the parties. To that end, the Court noted:
- [34] … despite the unavoidable adversarial quality to protection proceedings, the 'thrust of the Act is to provide solutions for unsatisfactory home situations including supervisory orders and the provision of support services to assist the parents'… To that end, proceedings must be as flexible and informal as is consistent with fairness. The primary goal is to reach a consensual resolution. Absent such a resolution, 'a court will be obliged to make the order or orders it

thinks fit based on the state of the current evidence before it'…. The scheme of the Act envisages 'an evolving process whereby a court is enabled, on the best evidence currently available, to decide what should be done concerning the custody and care of children…

[35] With that understanding of the disposition aspect of a protection proceeding, any discussion of onus or burden of proof is misplaced. This aspect of the proceeding should not begin with a general rule that a party will be unsuccessful unless he or she satisfies a specific burden of proof. The parties, whether the Director, the parents, or an interested third person, all bear the evidentiary burden of demonstrating the most appropriate care plan for a child. Once the Director has established on the balance of probabilities that a child is in need of protection and the court has made that determination, whether on an application under s. 41 or s. 49, the court must assess the evidence before it to determine the appropriate care arrangement within the strictures imposed by the Act. Until a continuing custody order is made, the duty to determine what care arrangement is most appropriate for a child lies with the court, not with the Director or the parents, unless they agree. No general rule should deflect the court's attention from the necessary inquiry into the child's needs and the parents' ability to meet them, with such support as the community is able to provide. As McLachlin J. (as she then was) wrote of an inquiry into the best interests of a child directed by the Divorce Act , so here, the inquiry into the appropriate disposition after a finding a child is in need of protection, "should not be undertaken with a mindset that defaults in favour of a preordained outcome absent persuasion to the contrary'…

[ B.B. , at paras. 34-35, internal citations omitted.]

[65] I highlight these passages because, while the Court in the first hearing was very clear about what the Parents' obligations were when it came to imposing the Last Chance Order, a Continuing Custody Order in this case is not a preordained outcome. The parties have the obligation to show the Court, on the evidence, what the appropriate arrangement is for the child, and a careful analysis of the evidence presented on this hearing is necessary for the Court to discharge its duty in this case.

## B.  Statutory Scheme

## i. Guiding Principles

[66] In making orders pertaining to child protection matters, the Court must be guided by s. 2 of the CFCSA . Children are entitled to timely decisions made pursuant to the Act and the timely implementation of those decisions.

- [67] Section 2 outlines the Act's guiding principles. The section gives paramountcy to the safety and well-being of children. These two considerations are given effect through the recognition and application of several principles which include: the entitlement of children to be protected from abuse, neglect and harm or threat of harm, the recognition of the family as the preferred environment for the care and upbringing of children and the primary responsibility of parents to protect them, the priority to provide support services to parents so they can provide a safe and nurturing environment for a child, the recognition of the importance of a child's views when appropriate, the need to preserve kinship ties, and the importance of timely decisions related to children. Where children and families are Indigenous, there are specific additional principles that must be considered, however, they do not apply in the present case.

## ii. Continuing Custody Order after a Last Chance Order

- [68] The present application is made by the Director pursuant to s. 49(9) of the CFCSA for a Continuing Custody Order following the imposition of a Last Chance Order. Pursuant to s. 49(10) of the CFCSA , the Court is only able to make one of two orders: either (a) place the child in the continuing custody of the Director, or (b) return the child to the parent apparently entitled to custody. Accordingly, the options are limited.
- [69] Prior to making any order, the Court must consider the factors listed in s. 49(6) of the CFCSA . That section requires the Court to consider (a) the past conduct of the parent towards any child who is or was in the parent's care, (b) the plan of care, and (c) the child's best interests.
- [70] If the Court grants a Continuing Custody Order, then pursuant to s. 50(1) of the CFCSA , the Parents' guardianship rights over S.S.W. will be extinguished and the Director becomes the sole personal guardian for S.S.W. and may consent to his adoption and the Public Guardian and Trustee becomes S.S.W.'s sole property guardian.

## ANALYSIS

## A.  Position of the Parties

[71] The Director submits that when all necessary factors are balanced, the only appropriate outcome is the Continuing Custody Order. The Director submits that the Parents have been given every opportunity to address the child protection concerns and work towards reunification with S.S.W.; however, they have proven unable and unwilling to take advantage of these opportunities. The Director says that the child protection concerns cannot be separated by parent - Mr. W.'s concerns are Ms. O.'s concerns and vice versa. The Parents, collectively, have been unable to rectify the concerns that exist and the risk of harm and neglect still remains. The Director says the only order that is in S.S.W.'s best interests is the Continuing Custody Order.

[72] Mr. W. submits that the child protection concerns only relate to Ms. O. Once the home renovations have been rectified, there are no further concerns that exist and S.S.W. should be returned to his care. He is capable and willing of being a parent that can act in S.S.W.'s best interests.

[73] Ms. O. acknowledges that S.S.W. cannot immediately return to her care, but she wants the chance to be a mother to him. She acknowledges the error of her ways by not engaging with social workers. She submits her home is stable and safe, and that she can provide a life that puts S.S.W.'s needs first. She, along with Mr. W., will ensure S.S.W. remains safe and his needs are attended to. She says that her addiction, the issue that caused his removal, no longer presents a risk of harm to him as she is now sober.

## B.  Section 49(6) Considerations

## i.  Past Conduct of the Parents

[74] The Parents each have different histories when it comes to having children in their care.

- [75] Apart from S.S.W., Mr. W. had no previous Ministry involvement and successfully raised his son J.S.W. The evidence supports the conclusion that Mr. W. raised J.S.W. as a single father without issue until J.S.W.'s late teenage years. J.S.W. is now 30 years old, is a father himself and has lived independently for many years. He testified that his father was a good father to him; one who taught him many positive life lessons. While he does not see his father as much as he would like, he plans to see him more now that he has a child of his own and once that child has grown a bit. He told the Court he does not know his brother S.S.W. very well as his life circumstances since S.S.W. was born have been busy and do not permit him many opportunities to see him. He has never attended family dinners, video calls or visits, aside from one or two brief visits during an exchange. It is his opinion that his father and Ms. O. do not get to see S.S.W. enough; however, he also acknowledged that he has not seen his father's current home, nor is he aware of what child protection concerns exist as they relate to S.S.W.
- [76] I am satisfied that J.S.W.'s circumstances being raised by his father over 15 years ago are markedly different than what S.S.W. would experience if he was returned to Mr. W.'s care.
- [77] Ms. O. has struggled in independently rearing her children and has never successfully raised a child into their adulthood. As previously mentioned, her eldest two children were subject to voluntary care and extended youth agreements and the four youngest children, including her step-daughter M. and S.S.W., have been removed from her care at varying times. Presently, while she has some unsupervised access to S.B.M. and S.D.M., this only occurs when the children are visiting with her parents and the evidence is unclear if that is in accordance with their father's wishes as he is the primary custodial parent and Ms. O.'s parenting time is subject to his discretion. Ms. O. says that S.B.M. and S.D.M. intend on moving in with her at some point.
- [78] Ms. O.'s prior Ministry involvement was prompted by her inability to provide a stable and safe home for any of her children. She exposed them to her own addiction, drove with them while intoxicated, and neglected them. Without intervention and supports from the Ministry or her parents, or both, Ms. O., for various reasons, has been

unable to fully exercise the duties and obligations of a parent to her children and she has not played an active parenting role with any of her children since 2017.

[79] With respect to S.S.W., the Parents have never fully parented him because of their inability to address the child protection concerns that prompted his removal for over six years. Despite being given an opportunity through the Last Chance Order to fully engage with social workers to remedy the child protection concerns, the Parents behaviour showed they were incapable of taking sustained and meaningful steps to address concerns and act in S.S.W.'s best interest. Engaging in programming, making the home safe and suitable for a child, and even something as simple as obtaining identification has never been prioritized. Instead, the Parents fell into a routine of making excuses and disengaging with the Director when they felt things were not going their way or disagreed with what was required of them.

[80] While the Parents are very much bonded with S.S.W. and no doubt love him, neither of them have meaningfully parented S.S.W. outside of supervised access visits and their inability to work with social workers has resulted in S.S.W. spending his entire life in Ministry care. I agree with the Director's submission that the child protection concerns cannot be parsed out between the parents as they act, by all accounts on the evidence, as a single unit.

## ii.  Plan of Care

[81] The Director's Plan of Care is focused on establishing permanency and stability for S.S.W. If a Continuing Custody Order is granted, S.S.W. will remain with the L.'s and the Director will take steps towards adoption. The L.'s have expressed a willingness to keep S.S.W. in their home and become his adoptive parents, something that is supported by the Director.

[82] The Plan of Care also includes an openness agreement, whereby the Director and the Foster Parents commit to maintaining S.S.W.'s kinship ties with his birth parents, his siblings and his extended biological family. While the genuineness of this was questioned by counsel for Mr. W., I accept this commitment as sincere. During the

hearing, it became apparent that Ms. L. has taken every possible step to identify and seek contact with S.S.W.'s relatives in order to foster and maintain those relationships. She has been met with success in some instances, however, in others family members advised they do not wish her to have their contact information, or simply do not wish to be contacted.

- [83] Counsel for Mr. W. submitted that the actions of the Director in stopping family dinners after the move to Abbotsford meant that kinship ties have not been preserved by the Director. I disagree. It may be that the family dinners reduced in frequency upon S.S.W.'s move to Chilliwack and then later ceased; however, I accept that was, in part, because the Parents decided not to follow rules by taking S.S.W. into the community unsupervised and then would not meet with the Director to discuss anything. The family dinners were further limited because Ms. O.'s father fell ill. I am satisfied that genuine efforts have been made by the Director and the Foster Parents to ensure these ties are preserved and I have no reason to believe efforts will cease if a Continuing Custody Order is made. I accept Ms. L.'s evidence when she told the Court she would support the idea of integrating the families through an openness agreement, should she ultimately be able to adopt S.S.W.

[84] The Director's Plan of Care would see S.S.W. remain in the home he has become settled in and keep ties to the Parents and his extended family, but also with other relationships of significance for him including the L.'s, his friends and his teachers at school. The proposed Plan of Care achieves permanency and stability for S.S.W. and removes a substantial source of his anxiety, the fear of another placement.

- [85] The Parents advise the Court that after a structured transition, they could provide S.S.W. with a life that is safe, secure and stable. Ms. O. told the Court that she has a bedroom and clothing for him and their home, while still needing repairs, is suitable for a child. She says that if they are just given the opportunity, they will act in S.S.W.'s best interests. Counsel for Mr. W. submits that the Parents have maintained housing since January 2024 and that is evidence of their ability to maintain stability. She further submits that even though they refused to cooperate with the social workers, I should

accept the evidence of Ms. T. that there are no safety concerns with their home at this time.

[86] I am sympathetic to the plight of the Parents who, I believe, regrettably now see how significant these proceedings are. I am not satisfied; however, that their view of a life for S.S.W. is one that I can confidently believe will come without significant upset at some point in the near future. Removing him from his current placement to return him to parents he has never lived with will most certainly bring about emotional harm. It will destabilize him, undoubtedly cause his anxiety to return, and likely result in his regression and dysregulation. The Parents' inability to sustainably engage with the people, resources and plans designed to reunite them with S.S.W. for over six years leads me to conclude that a more than realistic risk exists that S.S.W. will find himself back into Ministry care not long after his return to them because of some form of neglect.

[87] Ms. O. candidly admitted that the Parents gave up when things got difficult. She also told the Court that she knows raising a child is hard, comes with many challenges and that she cannot simply give up when difficulties present themselves. While she demonstrates some insight into the consequences of her actions and inaction through her spoken words, and I have no doubt she believes what she is saying, I am not satisfied that a life inside her home would bring S.S.W. the much needed permanence and stability he requires as her and Mr. W.'s actions over the past six years demonstrates otherwise.

## iii. Best Interests of the Child

[88] Section 4 of the CFCSA requires I consider all relevant factors when determining what is in the child's best interests. These factors include: the child's safety, their physical and emotional needs and level of development, the importance of continuity in their care, the quality of their relationship with their parents and others and the effect of maintaining those relationships, their cultural, racial, linguistic and religious heritage, their views, and the effect of a delay in making a decision relating to them.

- [89] When it comes to the analysis in this case, I find the following factors germane.

## (a) Child's Safety

[90] S.S.W.'s safety and well-being are the paramount considerations for this Court. The child protection concerns that were present at his removal and at the time of the first continuing custody hearing have never been adequately addressed and remain outstanding. At that hearing, the Court found he was in need of protection at the time he was removed, and as of January 31, 2024, that remained true. Because nothing concrete has been done by the Parents to address any of the concerns since the Last Chance Order was made, I am satisfied that S.S.W. remains in need of protection. More specifically, I am satisfied that S.S.W. is likely to be harmed because of neglect and face emotional harm because of the Parents' inability to sustain a stable and safe home and adequately meet his needs. I am not satisfied that the circumstances which lead to his removal have significantly improved, nor do I have confidence that the Parents have an ability to presently meet his needs. Unfortunately, the manner in which the Parents have engaged with the Director over the past six years leaves me with no confidence that they will be able to adequately keep S.S.W. safe and place his well-being at the forefront.

## (b) Child's Physical and Emotional Needs

[91] When S.S.W. came into the L.'s home, concerns existed about his developmental needs and he suffered from significant anxiety and trauma attributed to the successive foster placements. The L.'s reorganized their lives to centre them on S.S.W. and his positive transition into their care. They took time away from work, ensured he attended therapy, worked with him at home, supported a sensory assessment, and enrolled him in pre-school to help him thrive. They created positive, safe and supportive relationships with and for him, taught him life skills, and with time and the routine they developed, his anxiety resolved resulting in his no longer needing therapy. S.S.W. has made strong emotional connections with the L.'s and others in his life, has made friends and is engaged in extracurricular activities and this has all been done while supporting S.S.W. to maintain a bond with his birth parents and ties to his

other family members. Not only is S.S.W. thriving in his current environment, he is excelling physically, emotionally, and academically, and his needs are being met. The Plan of Care that involves permanency with the L.'s is most definitely in his best interests.

## (c) Importance of Continuity in the Child's Care

[92] The importance of continuity in S.S.W.'s care is also a significant factor for this Court, given the substantial passage of time that has occurred since his removal. S.S.W. has suffered more than his fair share of upsets by being moved between placements given his extended time in the care of the Director. He has been required to adjust to different homes, different foster parents, different foster siblings, different lifestyles and different routines. His has suffered from significant disruption in his short life and he has never truly felt secure given the significant anxiety and fear he has of moving. One can only imagine how scary and overwhelming these fears are for a sixyear old and how hard it is to never completely be able to settle and form attachments because of the potential of being uprooted at any time.

[93] S.S.W. has had to face these fears because a life in foster care is the only life he knows. He has been in care for so long without permanency because significant efforts were made to work with the Parents and give them every opportunity to succeed at reunification with him. Protection proceedings were, on more than one occasion, adjourned and prolonged because of actions by the Parents. At now six-years old, S.S.W. is beginning his grade one year, has made friends and is building his own community and social network of peers. He has an established routine and has become accustomed to the care provided by the L.'s. Returning him to the Parents to live a life that has been historically unstable and which appears uncertain would substantially disrupt the continuity in his care and move him away from everything and everyone he has grown accustomed to.

## (d) Quality of the Relationship with the Parents and Effect of Maintaining it

[94] I accept that S.S.W. has a good relationship with the Parents and it is important to maintain that. I also accept that he has an interest in developing and maintaining relationships with his other siblings and members of his extended family. As discussed earlier, I accept that the Director and the L.'s are willing to continue ensuring S.S.W.'s kinship ties are maintained through an openness agreement once adoption is pursued.

[95] I am also satisfied these relationships will be maintained if the Continuing Custody Order is granted. This will be in S.S.W.'s best interests. I also accept that, if the Continuing Custody Order is made, these relationships may not develop into something more significant as the Parents will lose the opportunity to fully parent S.S.W. and their rights, as guardians, will be extinguished.

[96] While the Continuing Custody Order unfortunately has a significant impact on the Parents' rights, in my view, the order does maintain their relationship with S.S.W. in a manner that is consistent with his best interests. In proceedings such as this, it is the child's rights that are paramount, most specifically their right to protection and to live a safe and secure life that prioritizes their wellbeing. Returning S.S.W. to his parents would result in a significant upset to him and most certainly cause his anxiety to return. It would remove him from a life of stability where his needs are being met and place him in circumstances where his safety is uncertain and it is unclear for how long his wellbeing will be prioritized. To make such a decision in favour of the Parents in order to allow their relationship with S.S.W. to develop into something more than what has occurred within the limits of the weekly supervised visits would, most certainly, come at a cost to S.S.W.'s physical or psychological health and prioritize their rights over his.

## (e) Child's Views

[97] Over the past several months, S.S.W. has expressed to the L.'s and his social workers a fear of moving from the L.'s home. I accept that neither the L.'s nor the social workers have influenced S.S.W.'s views of what should occur and the L.'s have done a remarkable job in diverting discussions about permanency and adoption with him. I am

satisfied, that given his age, it is normal for him to be curious about why he does not live with his birth parents and seek out answers to his questions about his life circumstances and how it differ from his peers.

[98] I also accept that S.S.W. is a smart, intelligent child who is capable of expressing his own concerns about major life issues, including his fear of moving. Ms. L. told the Court that S.S.W. often seeks re-assurance from her and Mr. L. that he will not be required to move again, states that he loves his home and the family they've created and the activities he does. He has repeated this on multiple occasions to his guardianship social worker, Cherie Birner, and to Ms. Miletech. He has also said he would run away from wherever he had to live next in order to get back to the L.'s.

[99] I consider these expressions from S.S.W. to be indicators of his comfort in the stability his current placement and life circumstances provides him and his fear of losing that. As previously mentioned, life with the L.'s has permitted him to thrive and excel. These expressions by S.S.W., which I accept, show me how important his current care arrangement is to him.

## (f)  Effect of Delay

[100] The delay that has accrued in this case has been inordinate. S.S.W.'s entire life has been in foster care. Monumental milestones have been with caregivers who are not the Parents. Since birth he lived with a cloud of instability hanging over him so that the Parents could do what was needed to gain him back.

[101] I am satisfied that the Director made every effort to work with the Parents to remedy child protection concerns and rather than making the necessary efforts, the Parents took a defeatist approach to things, placed their own interests and views above S.S.W. and made no meaningful progress towards reunification. They blame the Director for assigning them social workers they did not get along with and, as stated in one written communication with Ms. Miletech, made them 'jump through hoops'. However, they also promised the Court at the last hearing that they would meaningfully work with the Director and do everything necessary to remedy the protection concerns.

[102] Six years is simply far too long of a time for a child to live in foster care without any permanence. Throughout that time, the Director gave the Parents countless opportunities to engage, and even when the Director felt compelled to pursue permanence for S.S.W., the Court gave the Parents another opportunity with the Last Chance Order. Despite these opportunities, the Parents failed to work with social workers and do what was needed. Instead, they provided a litany of excuses to the very people working to assist them in order to explain their inaction and unwillingness to cooperate.

[103] While the system was focused on giving countless opportunities to the Parents, S.S.W.'s life took shape. He went from being an infant, to a toddler, to a child who now has friends, is playing sports and is going to school. He moved from home to home to home until landing in a placement with two foster parents who have done everything possible to see him thrive, succeed and experience normalcy. Since coming into the L.'s care, S.S.W. has found stability and his safety and well-being has been their only priority.

[104] Because he has been in care since his birth, he won't be able to hear stories from his parents about what his life looked like as a baby or toddler. Instead, his early life has to be documented through something called a life book, not a family album, and even that life book has yet to be completed because, for unknown reasons, Ms. O. has not provided all the necessary photographs. Ms. L. has refrained from sharing photographs of S.S.W.'s early life that she has with him to respect Ms. O.'s request to be the one to present him the life book.

## CONCLUSION

[105] S.S.W. is entitled to a life that is stable, provides permanence and prioritizes his safety and well-being above all else. While the law recognizes the family as being the preferred environment for the care and upbringing of children, that is not always the case, particularly where parents have been unable to demonstrate an ability to discharge their primary responsibility to protect their child. This becomes even more apt

when, despite the provision of support services, parents are unable to remedy the circumstances that caused their child to be in need of protection.

[106] In the present case, I am satisfied that the Parents have been given every opportunity to work with social workers to address the child protection concerns and demonstrate they can parent S.S.W. Despite the provision of support services and efforts on the part of the Director to help the Parents succeed, their conduct over the past six years has demonstrated a general unwillingness to work with the Director and do what is required of them in order to prioritize S.S.W.'s best interests and make reunification possible. While they may have felt they were jumping through hoops, everything they were asked to do had a reason for it and they were more than capable of cooperating. I cannot now accept their word they will be able to keep S.S.W. safe and meet his needs if I return him to them. I cannot accept they will cooperate with the Ministry, or even access support services if the Ministry was to again become involved.

[107] I have no doubt that the Parents love S.S.W. very much, want what is best for him and believe they can provide that. And while I have great sympathy for the Parents, as the conclusion I reach in this hearing is not in their favour and will have a considerable impact on how their relationship with S.S.W. takes shape going forward, in my view it is not in S.S.W.'s best interests to return him to them. After a careful balancing of the evidence before me, and in light of the guiding principles, the law and the strictures of the Act , I am satisfied that the Director's application should succeed.

[108] Accordingly, I grant the Director's application and order that pursuant to s. 49(10) of the CFCSA , S.S.W. will be placed in the continuing custody of the Director. Pursuant to s. 50(1), the Director will become S.S.W.'s sole personal guardian and may consent to his adoption and the Public Guardian and Trustee shall become his sole property guardian.
